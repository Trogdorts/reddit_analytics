That's actually pretty cool and the way that CrazyRussianHacker does this experiment is hilarious and it makes it easier to pay attention and understand the concept. The fact that it has the possibility to be done with a garbage bag makes it way better because it means you can do it at home.  So the air inside the bag will be heated up by the sun because the bag is black, and this causes the temperature to rise inside and since heat rises, the bag floats up. When the air cools down or the sun is covered, the balloon falls because it is returning to the state at which it is the same as normal air.  No helium required!

A bit late to the party here but I'd say people like Robert West, Alan Cowley and Masaaki Yoshifuji could be deserving. These are some of the biggest names in main group chemistry and were the first chemists to break the "double bond rule" the view that heavy elements couldn't form multiple bonds. Apart from in transient unstable molecules.  West's group did the first Si=Si bond in 81  Yoshifuji's group did the first P=P bond also in 81  And Cowley's did As=As in 83.  You could argue that Cowley's was derivative of Yoshifuji's however it didn't behave as similar as you'd expect and as far as I know was the first true double bond between period 4 elements.  Interestingly the diphosphene made by yoshifuji isn't just a thermally stable P=P it is air stable as well.  These 3 basically spawned a whole field of low valent and low coordination number main group species. We now have double bonds of most main group elements and triple bonds of all carbon group elements. Ohh and a boron triple bond in an NHC stabalised diboryne.  Having said that I am doubtful any of these chemists would win as the main group isn't exactly fashionable currently.

You are correct in regards to school types and costs.   However I do think it is a similar dilemma in general that alot of 2nd degree/non traditional nursing students face. Basically, how much are you willing to pay(or borrow) to get your BSN done sooner than later? A CSU BSN may be a bit more marketable, but is it worth an extra 1-2 years of school? Maybe here in Southern California it could be.  Maybe not.   I'm still going back and forth between ABSN and ADN. But yeah, I definitely wouldn't want 6 figure debt with a for profit degree if I could help it.

Everything. Happens a lot in Australia as well.. although it seems to have declined recently. Strange as it sounds 1 can almost put its popularity here down to major police crack downs on ecstasy. They started being successful in cracking down on it so people moved over to Meth instead which was cheap and easy to get.. all of a sudden there was a spike in violence in night club areas. People went from feeling the love to being hyped up and aggressive. Sure it's my anecdotal opinion and not a proper study but I used to live in a major night club hot spot (Surfers Paradise) on the east coast of Australia and noticed this shift as did many others there.

Fentanyl is a conspiracy created by the Nixon administration to murder Marijuana and heroin users alike. In 1968 the chemical was synthesized by Richard Nixon himself in his bunker laboratory. It has since been used in at least 35 chemical attacks on marijuana/nbomb growers to "taint" their "product". As a result millions of Americans are dying from Fentanyl overdoses when all they're trying to do is smoke their nbombs. Fuck corporate America honestly they just want to take the middle class down.

I've only ever sold 10 SR's, and all the ones I sold are ones I didn't like idolize or worst girl. But I refuse to sell more because I like owning over 100 SRs.  If you want to sell some, I think selling ones you don't like idolized would be your best bet. Since it won't really hurt you if you get them again, cause you don't like them idolized. You could consider the weakest ones too, but I think having cards you genuinely like idolized is better than having slightly stronger cards.

&gt;There are also positives to that immigration, those people tend to do jobs British people are generally unwilling to do, such as fruit picking, cleaning and others.  Yes, but the negatives of immigration are all concentrated on the already poorest in society as the majority of immigrants aren't coming to do middle class, highly educated jobs. 1% extra growth per year is of no use to a 20 year old UK bricklayer who has to accept lower wages and a lower standard of living because he's competing with an immigrant coming from a poorer country who will work for less.

Most come with an option to disable wifi. Of course, if you're buying it as a device for web browsing or whatever, you're kinda screwed. Also, a lot of stuff is so locked-down that it's still not really possible to exploit it via wifi. I've never heard of anyone successfully hacking a game console and installing custom firmware over wifi. Not saying it's impossible, though.   Also, a lot of devices ship with known security flaws from day 1, and never get updated. Especially stuff like TVs, printers, cameras, etc. Most people don't realize, or don't care, so the hardware manufacturers don't bother.

Here is another interesting link in the interview.  https://youtu.be/h9aIUrYJZ_s?t=1207  Based on what remember about SF4 thought; It didn't start out as a great game. It took Capcom while to seemingly get it right in Ultra SF4. So SF5 might go the same route. I cant speak for SF4 much but coming from a relative novice; combos and moves in Guilty Gear seem to be more responsive and make more sense with the inputs. So maybe there is something to the input lag issue.
I probably wouldn't even try to remove the shields, but if you have some solvent (alcohol, mineral spirits, lacquer thinner) just try to pour some down inside by the middle and spin to remove. Then I would use whatever the lightest weight oil you have, I would say something like spindle oil but wd40 may even work well.   Take it out of the plastic before you start pouring solvent! Andy have fun. It looks cool I like it.

This is what I expect to hear from most people, but what about things like idolization? For example, there are some SRs where I'm iffy because *if* I were to get another, I'd be able to idolize it, but selling it erases that chance. Although, I guess now it's easy to idolize SRs anyways so this doesn't affect the decision much...

Disrespect is real from Jensen 
Most drugs don't affect my posthumans.  The exception? A certain variety of plant found all over the world, in every human-inhabited environment, produce leafs/fruits/vegetables containing human neurotransmitters, which are then refined by posthumans and injected directly into the bloodstream in order to increase that neurotransmitter's production. The refined stuff can be used to permanently alter a successor's personality over time, which was used by several dictators to maintain control of their populations; its historical misuse means that most nations heavily regulate it, and only allow it for medical purposes after being approved by wizards who understand it well. Poorly refined versions of the drug can cause the opposite effect - for example, dopamine might cause someone to permanently fall into a deep depression. Overuse of even the refined versions will cause a death spiral, causing a successor to fall into [Anderson Syndrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/552sxa/what_are_the_some_interestingbizzareterrible/d87c9gn), which is the lethal depression-like disorder that kills most successors.  A technique created long ago lets people mix various different neurotransmitter-plants to create the planet's alcohol equivalent, with a variety of resulting experiences from mild inebriation to LSD/shroom trips, depending on the way it's made. Posthuman psychology means that mixes are less likely to cause Anderson Syndrome, and so this is much less regulated than the unmixed version. The more talented the maker of the mix is, the more the mix is an experience instead of a feeling.  Some people argue that the plants feel, and so hurting them is normally considered animal abuse.  The plant itself adapts to its environment, coming in a lot of different varieties, although the most cultivated ones are massive underground flowering vines, urban trees with colorful fruits, flowers in rocky plains, and underwater coastal/reef kelp-like forests.

When I was a kid, I used to walk to and from school since I lived just down the block. I was walking home one very dark night from our after school program, when I came to only 1 of the 3 lamp posts that were between my school and my house. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw a floating orb just a little bit past where the light didn't reach. I was scared shitless. I honestly didn't know what to do, and then it started to approach me. I just stood there in shock, when it finally came under the light, and it was just a big black dog with a giant white spot on it's side. I sighed the hugest sigh of relief in my life, pet the dog, and sprinted the rest of the way home.  Not paranormal, but the it's the closest I've ever come.

&gt; EDIT 2: Spoke to "Player" recently. He basically told me he doesn't like the marathon 10 hour sessions. So, it appears to actually be a player issue, not a wife issue, as I was led to believe.  Honestly, it sounds like the player just isn't interested in your campaign. If he were, he would make time. (He found time for his own campaign, after all.) Or he would relish playing marathon sessions once a month.  If I were in this position (and I have been in this position), I'd cut the player and move on.

Maybe it's just here in New Zealand but we're advised in antenatal classes, and by our doctors, midwives, and health nurses for our babies to avoid using fleece sleepers or sleep sacks. It's not a very breathable material and overheating is a SIDS risk factor. Instead we're told to use merino or cotton for sleeping and to use multiple layers if it's cold (e.g. merino singlet, cotton sleeper, merino sleep sack).   One of our government research institutes, AgResearch, released a report in 2010 comparing a merino sleeping bag with a Halo polyester/fleece sleeping bag and concluded that the merino sleeping bag was a better choice. The [report is here](https://www.ikbenmama.nl/images/merino_onderzoek.pdf) if you want to read it.  Ultimately they're probably both fine, but there definitely seems to be a greater risk of baby overheating in a fleece sleepsack.

Rhaegar was a fool who chased prophecy like a Skitty chases its own tail.  Mace Tyrell isn't an idiot; rather he's smart enough to recognize he's not the smartest guy in the room. His biggest talent is being able to delegate things to people who can do shit better like intrigue to his mother and daughter abd warfare to his sons. If Mace were truly an idiot he wouldn't have survived that long.  Aegon VI is the real deal, but the Iron Throne is not going to be relevant anyway.  Had a sorcerer been close by, they could have channeled the massive bloodshed and taboo breaking at the Red Wedding to conduct a powerful magical ritual.

I had no trouble finding on-street parking outside the paid areas that was within a short (few blocks) walking distance of downtown. For you I would suggest that area generally around the intersection of Lauf√°svegur and Bragagata or Baldursgata. Just make sure you mind the signs. A blue circle with red outline and red slash through it means no parking. Yellow on the curb means no parking (usually due to a driveway). There are some spots reserved for certain guesthouses, etc. Keep your car as close to the curb as you can and if it's a wide car a lot of people put the tires a little up on the curb to keep the narrow streets more clear.  That said, I'm no authority on the matter or what's legal. I'd suggest you should ask your Icelandic host to confirm your parking approach isn't going to get you a ticket :)

&gt; I feel like we're getting closer to a something that will keep people your worried about from cheating the system without screwing over the people its intended to protect.   To be clear, the people in rent controlled places that are paying lower rents, but could afford market rate rents, aren't "cheating the system", they're just using the laws as they are, and making decisions that make the most sense to them. I'm not overly concerned that some people get some benefit that they don't need, but I'd rather that the scheme in place doesn't have the other wide-reaching negative effects on the market as a whole.

You don't have to upvote. But that was my duo partner. I was hype af tbh lmao 
could be, it's basically just a packaged version of the PU.  You have light medium and heavy armor and you can pick stuff that fits those slots.  Light armor can only equip a single main weapon and a sidearm, where medium can equip two main weapons, for example.  I should say this is speculation based off what I know about SC and the PU and having not heard any plans for "classes" that would be unique in SM and not in the full game.  They could turn around and add arcade type elements to the arenas, but I doubt it.
I try not to worry about things I can't control.

I don't see anything better to be fair. Maybe : "Classified as obsolete" would also fit.
&gt;It's my way of making sense of the different groups throughout the series which share many similarities. I know it's not perfect and I don't claim that it's true canon, but for now it ties everything together in a way that I think makes sense. my issue with this theory, and many theories like it... Why does ALL need to be connected ?   Like, you connect the shadow tribe responsible for Majora's Mask, the Twili, Groose and his descendants, the increase in tech magic (I presume to explain the BotW stuff that is upcoming), the wind tribe, the oocca and so forth....   While none of those things have ANY connection to each other.   Like, the connecting theories between the sheikah, Dark interloppers and shadow tribe have always been limited too : their stuff have eyes in their design/their stuff involves hiding your face.  Aside from that there is nothing even remotely linking them.   The rest of the stuff you pull into it have even less. I just don't see why anyone should start from the thinking point of : "How am I gonna connect all of these?"   Hell, to point at something you refer to in this post : Serb's map of the cosmos wasn't made with the idea of "connect all the alternate worlds together"   It was created cause he came to the conclusion that (in his view of things) it would make the most sense if it all WAS connected/the same world. .  I know I'm not really answering the shadow magic question (on that topic, I think it "shadow" is just an "element" or "school" of magic like any other)  but yeah, just wanted to state my confusion with theories like this that (As far as I see it) just connect a shit ton of stuff first, and then try to make it work

Not at all, that's not what I said. I suppose it's good, I'm not saying it isn't. What irks me is (a) the hypocrisy of it- we can all agree that him avoiding flying around in a jet *as well as* planting trees would be more true to his credo- and (b) it's much easier to make grand statements about reducing emissions when one isn't focused on their next meal.  I think what he's doing is great, but I also think he needs to be cautious not to be too precious about it, lest he lose the ears of those for whom the issue (and solutions) must be presented in a more palatable manner if they are to be swayed.

Eh. There are cheaters who hack and they should be banned but other than that I don't see any major issues. Is it a little unfair that lower levels have it easier since they can refill their stamina with a rank up? Yeah I suppose but if you're good at the game and have some decent characters and go on winning streaks you'll do just fine. I'm rank 100 so my rank up refills are VERY far and few between and I only have two 6* characters (and the only one I'm using on my team is Naruto) and I'm in the top 1000. F2P account, and no pearls used to refill stamina. Learn how to space well, use your typing advantages and realize that a team full of 6* doesn't guarantee success and you'll be successful.

I try a few different songs that everyone plays. I just watch the guitar salesmen until I can tell that one of the songs is particularly irritating to them. Then I crank it up and purposefully play it as bad as I can until they come and ask me if I need any help in the most passive-aggressive way possible. I calmly reply "no" and continue playing while staring deep into their eyes as I watch their souls die a slow and painful death.  But really, I play a few scales, improvise some licks and riffs and try out whatever new song I've learned recently.  If you're going to play a song most new guitar players play, but nice and keep the amp volume low.

FYI for those scrolling the comments... this comment by /u/Piroko is very explanatory and may shed some light on why this decision may not be as bad as it sounds (though it still sounds *quite* shady and sketchy to me)  &gt; &gt;So, THEORETICALLY, the US Department of Commerce "owns" the right to name who is the IANA (internet assigned numbers authority). ICANN (internet corporation for assigned names and numbers) holds the IANA role under contract from the US government and has for 18 years.  &gt;This situation came about because 20 years ago, NSFNET (national science foundation network) provided MOST of the backbone capacity for the internet. The USCISI (university of southern california information sciences institute) acted as the master bgp route table.  &gt;However, the job began to balloon as the internet grew and there was some grumblings of power games at USCISI and NetSol (Network Solutions) so the IANA role was created and contracted to ICANN.  &gt;Fast forward to today.  &gt;For nearly two decades, ICANN and the (now) five RIRs have done a pretty good job of managing the internet and the master bgp table. They've been fair to all parties involved, have generally strived to make the IETF's improvements happen, cooperated with the ITU (international telecommunications union), etc.  &gt;But every two years they still have to renegotiate with the US government to continue to be the IANA.  &gt;But why?  &gt;What power does the US government have over them now? NSFNET is gone. ARPANET is LONG gone. Even the Abilene network (which was awesome when I was in college) has faded away as just one more link. The days when the government could claim to be a backbone provider are decades past.  &gt;If for some political reason the US government decided to try to leverage its hypothetical power over ICANN, what  the hell could the US government possibly do if ICANN simply refused to work with them? Shut them down?  &gt;The AS'es (autonomous systems; that is, individual networks) all listen to ICANN. The stability of the internet depends on SOMEONE being the master bgp table, and ICANN has done a pretty good job of it. Only one bgp table in the entire world can be canonical. The rest are just merely "eventually consistent". Shut ICANN down and who's bgp table becomes canonical? The one the US government says?  &gt;Or the one the ITU says? Mind you, the ITU is a UN agency all worldwide telecommunications providers ALREADY cooperate with. What would happen if the US government tried to wield its power, is that the ITU would walk in, name someone as the worldwide master bgp table, and that would be the end of it. With a pen stroke the US government would be written out of the picture, BECAUSE THEY ALREADY ARE OUT OF THE PICTURE. They aren't a major backbone provider.  &gt;The tier 1 networks, the backbone providers, ALREADY listen to the ITU for matters of standardization. Its the ITU that tells them what orbits are safe for their comm satellites, what frequencies are safe for their microwave relays.

The quote about helping a service make lots of money really bothers me. It's like saying a CEO can't read a book without permission because they could use the information to make money.

I'm thinking it's shot with a pretty long lens at a low f stop. That plus decent separation from the background gives it that total blur. The lighting is also key, likely some fill going on as she's very evenly lit.  For lightroom stuff, it looks like the blacks have been lifted a little, and the entire image looks a little desaturated. I think there might be a  bit of orangy blue split toning going on to bring out the contrasts in the colors a little, but it's very slight. The color temp looks a bit on the cool side.  I'm guessing the model's skin has been smoothed out to give it that flawless look, and some dodging and burning used to bring out the contours of her body.  edit: oh yeah, some grain added too

The story goes that the angry lady asked them not long before to share the cost of the fence going across the yards but the couple filming refused so she went ahead and built it without them. After the couple then connected their fence later angry lady asked them to pay half of the dividing part of the fence which they refused to again then this happened. Tl:dr Lady had all the right in the world to be pissed

I personally don't see anything wrong here. This is all run of the mill business stuff.   Imagine he lets them leave. Think of this headline instead "Trump claims to make the 'Best Deals' yet lets tenant breach contract and vacate lease!" or "Trump SLAMMED by restaurant owner!" Then the article says something like "Trump says he'll fight for the American people, but won't even fight for his own business. How can voters expect him to make deals with foreign powers when he can't even take on his own tenants?"   You can paint this however you want depending on how you report on it. It boils down to Trump is a businessman first, a politician second. That's why he has the support that he has. If he stops caring about his business because he's campaigning that can show weakness. So I am getting it, I just have a different view than you do about the subject.

I admit I liked Bernie and I think Trump V Bernie would have been the most entertaining election year ever. I started to get to know and understand DT a little more once I saw Bernie wasn't going to take the nomination. I didn't want to vote Hillary anyway, but after that shady DNC scandal to block Sanders I was thoroughly finished with the "Democratic" party, Hillary especially.   Now I actually am a big Trump fan. Yuge, tremendous, bigly.

I believe that "carbon copy" of Yan-kun would definitely work better because it definitely feels a little off to me if Yan-chan's personality did a complete 180 simply because a chromosome swapped.  It would also make the most sense for a "male option" protag. You can adjust Senpai's gender, but that doesn't affect Senpai's personality in anyway shape or form. The way I'm seeing it, Yan-kun is basically still Yan-chan, but in a different flesh suit (appearance).  The best option would be to have a bit of both words. Yan-kun is still an emotionless boy who needs Senpai to feel alive, but is much more openly sadistic and possessive about his beloved.

I don't work in the industry, but as far as I know, EMV is EMV, so you're covered from the liability shift protection as long as the chip is used, whether or not its done in sight of the customer. The customer can always dispute the transaction, but I'd think that as long as you're dipping the chip, it will be the standard dispute process rather than the automatic incontestable chargeback. I would think you'd be able to ask your processor if customer-visible dipping is required for full liability coverage.  The current American system seems perfectly normal to us Americans, but in the past I've seen several conversions with foreigners who are completely aghast at the idea. In some countries it's unusual for an employee to even touch a customer's card, let alone walk away with it.   When you start to think about it, there are two significant problems with the American system. One is that the card leaves the customer's sight, so the server can do whatever they want with it. Whether or not you use EMV, there's nothing to stop a malicious employee from running the card through a second fake reader that just captures the magnetic stripe details for later cloning; until magstripe use becomes as rare in the US as it is in other countries, that still has the potential to be an attractive fraud route. The second is the manual addition of tips later creates an opening for both innocent mistakes and intentional tip fraud.  I agree that there's the potential for social awkwardness of having the server hovering over the customer while they're deciding on a tip amount. As someone who has done a fair bit of international travel, I lean towards saying just do it and eventually we Americans will get over it. I remember in Canada the portable terminals had options to select e.g. 15%, 18%, or 20%, or enter a custom amount. So that makes it quick to just hit a button and get on with it. I'd be curious to find out how many people really give it much thought how much they want to tip each time and how many people just basically tip 15% or 20% nearly every time unless the service was exceptionally good or bad.  There was also one restaurant in Norway that actually left the portable terminal at my table while I paid while the waitress attended to another task, and I also saw her do it with other customers.  You could also go to the extreme and adopt a "no tipping" model and just increase prices and salaries accordingly; I've heard a few US restaurants have done this.  It actually sounds like your Pax S90 device is a decent solution. Just because it's portable doesn't mean you have to do table-side payments. As long as you can do Chip and Signature (either with signature preferring cards or PIN-bypass) and add the tip later, you can keep doing things the way you always have. But if you do run into a card that requires a PIN, then you can easily bring the terminal back to the customer so they can enter tip and PIN.  I have run into that. A couple of restaurants in Italy asked me if my card was PIN or signature, and after I said signature they took the card away American style and brought back the receipt for me to sign. And one place in London took the card away and somehow managed to get my signature preferring (but PIN-capable) card to do a Chip and PIN transaction and brought the portable terminal and card back to the table for me to enter the PIN.  One final thought (for now anyway) is that there is some speculation that US banks might be using Chip and Signature as an interim step and will eventually move to Chip and PIN. If that happens, adopting a portable terminal now would prevent another equipment change, especially if they take away the ability to do PIN bypass (as I hear happened in Australia a year or so ago).

However depending on budget a GTX 1070 and/or a i7 6700k would be good upgrades. How much do you know about computers and how they work? I would recommend doing some research if you don't.

It's not one in a million though. It's more like [one in ten million](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/vote.pdf) if you are in a state that is likely to make a difference. One in a hundred million if you're not. I don't buy lottery tickets, so why should I vote in any way other than my conscience?  Fun fact, I think this election is unlikely to be a very close given that the prediction markets give Clinton a [a 72% chance of winning](https://www.predictit.org/Browse/MostPredicted). Her odds have been steadily increasing for weeks now.

I already go to the gym! However like most gyms - everyone sticks in their headphones and says nothing. It's a bit sad - I've been going to the same gym for a year and haven't said a word to anyone!

I spent a lot of time on my career while everyone else was finding a spouse!
God that pedestrian annoys me. I get that the cyclist is breaking the law, but it's not the pedestrians job to  enforce the law. After all, the cyclist was being perfectly safe.

He's 9, I'm sure he did fine in school, it's all just rote memorization anyway. But like many kids his age he's still young enough to be highly impressionable and prone to fanciful thinking and he probably has highly religious parents.  Elementary and high school is pretty ineffective at teaching critical thinking. College pretty much is, too. And all they care about is GPA, for entrance requirements and scholarships. If you got good marks in high school, doesn't matter about anything else.  The only way to really get an education is through experience. An undergraduate degree doesn't fully qualify as that experience, but it can be a real slap in the face. He might have sailed through so far, but the work load and difficulty is about to ramp up quite a bit.  Thankfully, if he wants to become an astrophysicist he'll have to do grad studies and do actual, real work in the lab. That doesn't eliminate the possibility that he finds some eccentric tenured professor as a supervisor who indeed gets him to search for God or something, but there's a better chance he figures out how to ask good research questions long before then. 
That makes a lot of sense, it's better for people to have the discussions rather than not, at least to increase their understanding of consent  '"There is no correct way to negotiate getting someone into bed with you. In suggesting that there is, consent talks encourage women to interpret sexual experiences that have not been preceded by a lengthy, formal and sober contractual discussion as rape.'  ^ I do see his first point though, that there really isn't a 'correct' way to do this without asking constantly for consent every single step of the way, which I'd imagine to most people wouldn't be the norm  Even with the classes I'm not sure how this gets solved, it seems like it will always be a problem and there will always be terrible cases of false accusations and rapists walking scot free, but at least the classes give more opportunities for people to think about it

&gt; Bear in mind Depression gave rise to Hitler.  Bear in mind currency inflation gave rise to the depression, and not just in the US as Rothbard documented.  The Weimar Republic's hyperinflation from 1921 to 1924 torpedoed Germany's already-struggling economy, just as Austrian economics predicts.  Which caused political instability, which helped Hitler to power.

I have a few questions about the PhD programs at say Cambridge/Oxford (in number theory/arithmetic geometry).  I know you need a master's to apply (and I have one). How do they compare to the top programs in the US like Harvard/Princeton/Berkeley? Most ranking sites say they are about equal but I also somehow have the impression that they admit weaker students on average than these top schools.  This might just be because the really top people just don't want to relocate, is this true? It might also be because they end up admitting a lot more people.   Also, how is the general PhD structure compared to US universities? The duration of the PhD is much shorter but does that mean that a PhD at Cambridge would look similar to the last three years of a PhD in the US or are there other differences?

I can see some women legitimately enjoying it for the reasons you gave. But I'd also say that many *think* it could be enjoyable for those reasons then find out its really not.  Getting cum in your eyes burns. It isn't just mildly uncomfortable, it's painful. And then there's the possibility of jizz in your hair, or in your ears. Just imagine the sensation of jizz dripping out of your ears.   So sure, ideally she's someone who likes it so it's enjoyable for both parties.  But that's not the reality for many people, and like /u/CrazyIrina said, some people see it happen all the time in porn and think that's just how things are done. So I agree with her: it's an overdone move and an overly-accepted perception of mutual pleasure (which would be a fine perception if only people could remember that porn is fantasy).
Ah ok cool! The link you had above from the att site said otherwise.
You're not a horrible mom. I guess if someone made a list of reactions, yours might not be the #1 most ideal reaction. But you didn't overreact or do something wrong.

You're missing the point.  I agree with you, that they should face consequences (and generally they do).  We can talk about what those consequences should be or not be, but it's a different conversation.  I'm simply explaining why officers are trained to do this, and that is to limit civil liability to themselves and the police department.  When you purchase car insurance, one of the things you're told is to NEVER admit fault (it doesn't matter if you know you were at fault or you know that they were at fault).  Any time you admit fault or apologize (which is tantamount to admitting fault), you've opened yourself and your insurance company up to additional and unnecessary liability.

She will do anything to avoid this embarassment.  "Nooo dad you can't! I can't go back like this!"  "Why?"  And if she won't admit it then I don't know what you expect him to do.  There's no way for him to know she's getting bullied if she doesn't say something and a teacher hasn't reported it.

I'm not gonna lie, this all sounds extremely made up. I apologize if this really happened to you, but your throwaway account and the nonsensical things you say your parents did err a little too close to traditional christian propaganda to be believable. If this story happens to be true, I would concentrate on rebuilding your life before you reengage with your parents again. Get therapy, find more friends, reestablish hobbies and communal activities, etc. Figure out yourself and your beliefs before wading back into that firing range.  If it's not true, go fuck yourself, troll.
&gt;DuckTalesLOL  heheh   And the truck hath been pulled
Yeah I don't think that is in his dna. Like when hillary responded to the email question by saying she made a mistake and regrets it. Trump had to pause for a second like he never conceived someone would respond like that.

3rd for our triangle, or just sharing a code?   Next skill rotation has Ronove skillups too (Ancient Green Masks), so hyper just got a lot easier. I'll be working on mine and only 5 more attack plusses from a 297 to feed him. :)
He has the "he'll figure it out when it comes up" mentality because he "always has". Technically it's been me behind the scenes making sure we are ok when disaster has hit. New roof? Had it covered. Was out of work for an injury on/off for 3 years? I had it covered. But he saw it as just working out somehow even though I have made it clear the how was saving.   We did talk before getting married. He was firm on no joining of finances that he'd take care of his own stuff. At the time we didn't own a house and he always paid bills on time and had good credit so I figured as we grew older and had more money available to us we'd be smart with it since he'd never missed paying things. I was young though and 5k seemed like a lot to have saved at that age. Now I'm older and understand that the 4k he has saved at 35 is really really bad.
I don't know what I expected.

Lots of hate for United, although I've never had issues with them, including when I broke my arm. They were professional and took great care of me. 
I had a good amount of weight to lose, so the first two months were very steady at a rate of like 5 pounds a week. After that I started losing one pound a week and then hit a stall where I lost nothing for a few months and then figured out what caused it and now I'm back to losing roughly .5 to a pound a week again.  Scales are weird, if you feel great in your clothes then you're doing something good!
It depends on the situation. How long have you been dating? Were you friends before that and for how long? If she likes you there's no specific time. Either ask her and she'll say yes and you continue, or she'll say no and you know she doesn't actually like you. If you don't ask and just try to and she's happy about it then it's good. If she pulls away or stops you then you know she doesn't actually like you. Dating and relationships in high school are about exploration and learning how to do these things. If you don't take a chance and try, you'll never find out.

Yep, maybe you‚Äôre right.
Said above too. A lot of the places in my city (East TN) don't have cycle lanes and the roads themselves are NOT cycle friendly. It's either sidewalk or get run-over by a semi in some places by drivers who refuse to acknowledge cyclists as vehicles in their own right with "rights" to be in the lane. Cycling isn't considered a legitimate form of transportation here, so people are more likely to get mad at you being on the road than on the sidewalks.  It's fuckshit, I know. Add to that a system of greenways that act as sidewalks in parts of the city and the line gets even more blurred.  Hope this helps!

I suggested elsewhere that the only real 'sin' is getting caught.  But there is necessarily a list of sins that the cynical can use to say, "hey!  Christianity is the faith of brotherly love and tolerance!   Don't be evil!". And so the priests (for example) tear into the flock from the pulpit and then make off with the choirboys for a little after-church buggery and special religious instruction.

First, you won't stand out in green man. Sure there is a lot of white but a good portion of people don't care.

There's a bunch of extra commas that are not needed in the first sentence. The phrase "embedded in" doesn't really make sense. "Worked with" would make way more sense.  Generally I don't think you're supposed to quote single words like that. It messes with the flow of the sentence. You read that almost as sarcasm in the sentence - as if you were making air quotes with your fingers.  The second one is worse. The writer has no idea what an appositive is. It should read, "For her part, Google SVP of Cloud, Diane Greene, says ..." Also, in formal writing you never use contractions. "She's" should be "she is." Again proud and unprecedented should not be in quotes.  It does not come off as being professionally written.

I don't like either of them. Clinton started hiding things with premeditation. Trump is just covering up stupid shit from his past. We all know he's an idiot so at this point what difference does it make (see what I did there). You and I both know what her email server was for and it wasn't convenience. I don't think either one of them will be reelected. That is a plus.   I will never vote for Clinton and I live in a swing state so I can't really vote 3rd party. That leaves one option and as bad as it may be, it is still better than Clinton.

Depends on how advanced (and drunk) your group is. I've started with green aliens, and the rewards deck only for first play through. No flair, no tech, nothing else. I'll mix in flair the second time through, and start throwing in yellow and red aliens after that.  I don't have any of the other expansions other than dominion and incursion, but haven't felt the need for the others yet. Still haven't played with the tech deck.
Lee Sin isn't a bad pick.  Meteos on Lee Sin is a bad pick lol
I absolutely love Chaos Dogma. So much so that I infused my Outbreak Prime into it. However it can get a little clunky when dealing with multiple low level enemies. That's when I use my pdx or genesis chain. 
AH yeah :)
I don't understand not making weight 5 times. Once, ok sure maybe you fucked something up. But 5 times? Jesus Christ, it's kind of your job.
Congrats man! Can I ask what you've been doing special if anything? I'm letting the scale get in my head a little too much I admit, just figure maybe i could do something more to get a little more loss.

There's something very, very wrong.
Gimme that clapped dank savage memeing
I do agree they should ban cheaters as soon as possible, but I do think a boundary should be put. Those that abused the leveling system I like to say instead of blaming the cheaters for abusing it so much, I instead look at it as Bamco's fault for making the system so easily abusable. There will always be people trying to abuse a system. It should be their priority to make sure that doesn't happen.   They made no announcement the last PC when it came to banning people. If there was anyone modding I have no clue if they had banned them. Modders are the kinds of cheaters that need a definite ban.

&gt; Ranked will count like a Random battle would, does not mean you have to play a ranked battle.  Doesn't really matter for Haguro.  Neither Tier IV nor V will be in Ranked this season.  It's only VI and VIII.  So if you're playing Ranked, the damage will still count for the Nachi mission.
As title says, this is a crosspost from [the buttcoin post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/55328x/the_disaster_that_is_bitcoin/). This is a great example of how immature and vulnerable Bitcoin is. It's not that the other cryptocurrencies are better today. It's that Bitcoin hasn't built up a solid infrastructure of services. If another coin (say, DOGE, in a fantasy world) were to do so, I think it could easily overtake Bitcoin if it could get easier "on-ramps" and "off-ramps".  This is *not* a place where I expect to see NYAN compete. I expect us to focus on crypto-to-crypto trade. We don't have the size to be able to effectively launch such services, as a key hurdle. I'm also not sure if we want to increase our exposure to regulation and visibility in that way.  But it's an important area to watch. Ultimately, something has to change dramatically in order for cryptocurrency to start gaining any sort of mainstream traction; these sort of fees and unreliability and general user-unfriendliness simply won't do.
Our biggest buyers are people who fly in winter, outdoors in wet spring and fall seasons. For us, this is most of the year. If you ever dropped your 250 in snow in the winter and had to go home to dry it out, you would see more value. Its not for everyone, but it is for many.
I'm NC now so I'm never gonna get a chance to try this, but if anyone wants to, here's a possible response: instead of fearing what they'll call you, own it. If you don't like a gift, say so, and if they call you a spoiled brat, don't resist. "Yep, I'm a spoiled brat, I don't deserve gifts, clearly." I mean, what are they gonna do? Treat you like crap? They already are. Stop giving you gifts? Yayyy!   Defending yourself doesn't change their mind, it just saps your energy. Stop struggling to make them like you. Firstly, you know from experience that no matter what you do, even bending over backwards, it doesn't work. Secondly, of what value is someone's love if you had to argue, coerce and convince them into loving you?   That was the key that freed me. Hopefully it works for someone else.

The software engineer in me says there's an obvious tweak that can be done to remove what is now redundant information.  For instance, this thread title repeats the word Meta, once in the flair and once in the text of the title. Having AutoModerator change the title to strip out the Meta text would make it look so much cleaner.

It's really funny watching you twist and turn to try to make it seem like she resigned for some reason other than what 90 million people watched live. She's not going to say (obviously) "Hey, Trump is clearly a racist piece of shit and I'm opposed to that" so she said 'hey, this campaign is going in a way I'm not comfortable with'. But, shit man, if you want to claim she's leaving because the campaign is cratering then, hey, I mean that works too.   Still, given the timing (i.e. Monday) and its close proximity to his statements about women, minorities, Russia, etc etc etc then I think it's not too difficult to extrapolate.   And, yeah, what I believe is that he's Retard Hitler and the past week is just another grain in the fucking beach of his monstrosities. So, yes, this is a fairly meaningless confirmation of something we all already know.

When I was a kid, my cousin and I used to shoot the crows on his parents farm.  We used to lay out kangaroo guts in the paddocks to get them around.  We found that there was always one crow high up in a tree to act as a lookout.  If that crow saw us coming, it would squark and send the others flying.  We had to take that crow out first, to have a chance at the others.

I'm not downplaying people who have chronic pain. I recognize there are a lot of people who have to deal with pain on an everyday basis but can't find relief. But the topic being discussed is people killing "big pharm" and physicians for overprescribing narcotic painkillers. Here's a secret: No well-meaning physician wants their patients to rely on painkillers. So many people who have no idea about health care think that physicians just hand it out like candy and would rather treat patients that way. The fact is that a lot of patients develop chronic pain and a fair percentage (read: NOT ALL) want instant relief rather than to work on a sustainable plan for that chronic pain.  So you have this group of people who bitch at physicians for getting people addicted to painkillers, even though it's at the patient's request that they be started on painkillers to deal with chronic pain. And then you have people similar to you who have legitimate chronic pain that requires a regimen of pain medication but know how to not let it control your lives, where physical therapy and other methods alone aren't effective.

I'm committed that the cycle of abuse ends with my childhood. My hubby is, too. He was more of the lost child whereas I was outright abused physically and emotionally by my dad, sexually by a step"dad".  I'm early 30's, have an awesome hubby, and am 35 weeks pregnant with our first kiddo. We compliment each other beautifully and he's going to be a fantastic daddy to our little girl.   This entire pregnancy has been an exercise in rumination. Taking inventory of the things that happened to me. Committing to myself and our daughter that her earliest memories won't be rooted in terror like mine, or loneliness like his. Shoring up boundaries with my dad. He's older and more frail and can't do much physical damage to me anymore, but he could still do a lot of harm to my daughter. He's still very disrespectful and emotionally toxic. I actually had it out with him over the past few days via email exchange, which I summarized in today's sticky. I don't really know why I'm still even VLC with him. He's teetering the cliff of going back full NC. I would never treat my daughter like he continues to treat me. I don't get it.  I don't have much reading material advice except Toxic Parents and similar books. Toxic Parents was the source of my epiphany that the way my dad treated me wasn't normal or ok.  Anyway this is getting long.
The relevant part of the 23.6a regulation is this: "Any replacement gearbox will only be required to complete the remainder of the Event in question."  So because Vettel's gearbox was a replacement, which he suffered a penalty for, it was only required to complete the Singapore weekend (which it did). After that the gearbox completes its required amount of races (usually 6, but 1 for replacement), it can be changed for a new one whenever the team wants.

I just got another loan through them last week, 0.9% (36mo, used). My mortgage is through them too
Looks like you photoshopped a cat head on the towels
Obviously after week 3. I made the decision before that and the info I had was an 85 yd and 118 yd day w/ 0 TDs on the season. Our league is a .5 PPR and has only 4 bench players and no IR. I had Charles, Martin, Brady, and Watkins on my bench to drop. In hindsight, I should have dropped Watkins, but I have Evans and ARob too (both are top 3 in targets this year). I could have not played a TE, but I won by 0.9 pts by picking up Pitta. That could be the difference b/w making the playoffs or not w/ just 14 weeks. I also still believe D's will catch on to Jones (he's played the 28th, 13th, 29th ranked pass so far) and Tate should get some better looks. Still think Jones will end up top 15, but my other two WRs will likely be top 10. I think Evans will end up top 5
Tried and failed, nothing specific enough came about.

Spandex or confirmation bias?  Every study in the U.S. Has found that cars violate these laws as much (stop signs, red lights) or more (pedestrian cross walks) than bikes, but if you survey people they think bikes do it more.  The leading theory is that drivers are more likely to not notice when fellow drivers do it.

Word!
This is how I feel. People are perfectly capable of making decisions due to multiple reasons. And like you said it is also possible that all of the named reasons are in fact interrelated. Maybe the Doctor's boredom led him to rebel and whatever he saw in the Untempered Schism scared him into "running away". Maybe both this boredom and fear lead him to explore the Matrix where the Cloister Wraiths told him about the prophecy. Maybe while learning more about the prophecy he discovered information about the Other which caused him to try to leave Gallifrey with Susan and the Hand of Omega. The President found out the Doctor was trying to leave so Brax was sent to kill him, but Brax let him leave instead.

i dont hate him and actually think he's pretty funny  but he's gotten very self-important lately and loves to shit on anyone who hasn't achieved anything up to his standards, often forgetting that if it weren't for this podcast, he'd probably be irrelevant.  also there's the whole dick riding/flip flopping thing. dick-rides anything Rogan says. Dick-rode Ronda until she lost. It's actually funny listening to old podcasts where he said she  had better "mma-striking" than Holly Holm, but now says that her striking has always been shit.   and how he acts like he's a social media and fashion geinus. anyone who has taken a college marketing class knows how to run a twitter and instagram for a business. and his "fashion sense" is not as cutting edge as he thinks  lmao im done now

You gotta do you, man! And I mean that. I've gone years between dates even, because finding a relationship just to be dating someone wasn't my priority at the time. And you are correct, losing weight is directly related to how you eat and how you move. That's the case for every living thing on this planet. Long term results require long term changes.  If cardio is something you enjoy, that's great! There are a lot of really fun options out there. You might find, though, that you can get more out of the cardio if you supplement with weight training. For example, I want to be able to run a mile in a not laughable amount of time one day, but I have a lot of pain in my knees from an old injury. So with my doctor's advice and a trainer's help, I do exercises to develop strength in my knees, keeping them more stable and reducing the pain. It works!  As for the science classes taking up your time, I'm not entirely sure how my boyfriend got a science PhD while also spending hours in the gym. Honestly sounds like he didn't sleep for five years to me, poor man. That's definitely not for everyone. But to him, it was important to make his training a priority, and it still is.  Best of luck as you find your way through college and the rest! Keep building yourself up and become the best person you can be, and I'm sure that eventually, you'll find someone who appreciates that and all you have to offer.
It's so fucking brutal. I'm sad for 76ers fans. Nobody deserves that type of luck. :(

FFIII first came out in the US on the DS as a remake a couple years into the DS lifespan.  FFI and FFII came out on the PS1 as ports as FFOrigins pretty early on. I'm not sure there was a FFII localization before that. Those ports were also released on GBA, PSP, and now Android/iPhone/PC I believe, all in various states of porting/upgrade. I know the PSP version of 1 was very high quality at the time, for a port. Close to a remake. The mobile/pc ports have been pretty iffy.

It depends. PL/PSG can be as excited as they like, but if the task actually ends up being bullshit, that will make the joes distrust the briefings.   Example: OPORD says we are doing an area reconnaissance. There's "a platoon size element and heavy armor in the AO."  We get out there, do our thing. Come to find out, it's three MPs on a HMMWV. None of the MILES gear works, there's six Bradleys with dismounts all over the place. We have to go PEW PEW PEW and the BC has to scream "YOU FUCKERS ARE DEAD" at the MPs.  So we just spent five hours searching for one truck and we can't even simulate taking them out? Thanks LT. Glad you were so enthusiastic when you basically lied to us.  I would much rather be told "hey guys, this is going to be kind of goofy. It's a small group of OPFOR and there's a lot of us. Take it how it is, and here's how we can make it better/more entertaining."
Thanks! His dick makes me quiver... 
Nah, she is the Cardcaptor.   Must be the Exodia cards. Since she probably could always trigger the ridiculous conditions.
I'll be joining y'all tonight and tomorrow
yeah can people stop saying C9 can contest first in this group...
You're right, you inspired me to look it up since I don't know a damn thing about the specifics. [These are the US Army's Physical Fitness Test standards for passing.](http://www.wiu.edu/coehs/military_science/physical_training/APFT%20Standards.htm) Says a 60 in each category is a pass. I'm kind of interested in how they decide these things. I am pretty surprised by the size of the gap between the two gender's expected performance.
Well then. Flash time fuckery it is. Lmao

~~Sorry for the caps~~, this is copy paste from C Span's transcripts. I still don't see the part where she says she'll be invoking tougher marijuana laws.   &gt;**Unidentified speaker** I have too much respect to do that. But, this summer the dea was looking to reschedule the class of marijuana specifically with regard to medicalmarijuana so institutions could do more research. And we have seen that many children with epilepsy have dealt with the effects of cdc. Many times when the question has been asked of your mother, she has not been as pacific about where she might stand about rescheduling marijuana. I wonder if you have any more information? 00:21:38   &gt;**Chelsea Clinton:** she has been clear so I am sorry you felt she hasn't been. Please go to her website. One of the challenges with the experiments happeningaround the country at the state level, and she supports states in making whatever decision is right for them, is that we have no real way to study them. So anecdotally we have a lot of evidence in the area you talked about, in epilepsy, autism, in a stimulating appetite for people that are on intensive chemotherapy regimen, for people who have non-epilepsy leisure disorders and challenges, that we also have and it dead -- anecdotal evidence from colorado where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the corner believed after they die that there was drug interaction with other things they were taking. One of the reasons we need rigorous studying is that we want to know where it works and where it does not because probably there are some areas where it works and areas where it does not. One of the reasons the fda has such rigorous testing and one of the reasons our fda approval process is the gold standard for the world is the rigorous study of new drugs and how they interact with over-the-counter drugs and prescription drugs. That is why when we get a prescription, there are warnings . Some are really explicit instructions. If you are taking these four rugs, please note your doctor knows that before you start this prescription. We just need so much more data than we have so that people who might benefit have a chance to benefit. People who might be in danger are protected. My mom strongly support the need for more rigorous study and addressing everything that may have medicinal purpose.  edit: fixed the all caps
Just low rank stuff. I once won a game cause a mage didn.t ping me 2 turns in a row while I was sitting at 1hp.
If he is on the fence, alienating him may just push him over the edge. People like that feed into others insecurities and envelop prospects in a sense of family (from what I've read, never experienced so ymmv )  If he isn't all the way gone, they should try to bring him back to sanity.
I see the gap between wildcard teams and NA closing.
Faker shit on jensen
Thank you for the insightful comment and brigading over from r/socialism but no, but I can link you to some good economic debates from the 60s and 70s between socialists and staunch free market advocates if you would like. 
I hope we get smoother fights akin to Monty's style or an improvement on Monty's style. Or just cool-looking fights in general.
Thank you for posting this, but can anyone else tell that it reboots every five seconds? It may just be me. 
I mean, they already give it away to people when the infrastructures not being used. I'm sure they could make it work somehow, even if they limited it to specific times of the day, it'd be worth it for sure.
Literally Mid die
Oh I remember when I commented here, I stopped because I got more than 100 downvotes on a comment lol.
Should've cleaned the mirror first
I still remember the collective groan that Quake 2 caused with no CTF support out of the box.  Still one of my favorite games/multi-player experiences ever, though. 
So, yes
You have to be extremely careful performing this mod on the Note 7. The SIM stray isn't as rigid as an S7 Edge so if you don't have the SD/sim Frankenstein sitting super flush the sim can get stuck on the pins and rip them off the board rendering tray 2 broken and you might also get your sim tray completely stuck in the phone.
I only have After Burner 2, but that is considered the better port. GF2 runs at a reduced frame rate (30fps). AB2, runs at the arcade perfect 60fps. Furthermore, AB2 has the option to play with the melody versions, making it one of the best versions of the game anywhere (maybe only recently bested by the 3DS version, but you can't play that with a Mission Stick!).
He should be happy about what the Knicks did in the offseason. 
Works for brazil!, thanks!
Now I want chocolate
howard is the only healthy back on the team right now... Who else would run the ball?
Lol the Myki I bought before the 2012 grand final expired because they only last 4 years for some stupid reason. Bet a few people are experiencing that.
Go to the DMV ASAP!
You know what, I should really start remembering to put watermarks/signatures on my stuff. I'm not used to that being necessary, I need to get that habit going :U
What bad areas? Been here five years about and I've yet to hit a bad area. I live off Victoria nearish to Harbor and go all over the city. 
Right, which is one hour from now, not three. 
ITS TIME
Lol - thanks for responding! I figured it out when I ran across that tweak - it works awesome and thanks again!!!  Edit - also just using InvertRespring. 
This guy also wrote a book called "the power of habit" it's awesome.   It's funny. I think you can have leaned this skill but it may not always fill your life. I'm transgender. It took years and years to find that inner drive. That I am even allowed to act on the world. That I have free will. And today, I am quite self motivated. I work in personal projects, follow through on all the important stuff. I even came up with a plan to buy a big van, convert it to an rv, then travel the country avoiding the cold because of my chronic pain condition. Through all the pain and bullshit and depression, I followed through. My first trip in the van was the weeks ago. I'm about to go on a month long trip and then, I should be gone for good. Me! The anxious, scared, tiny, disabled, passive lunar limbo has built a new home in 9 months.   But I still cannot buy clothing. I still can't use this subversive inner sense of power, control. Fucking so hard. Sigh. Keep going I suppose
lol
Girlll your make up and lipstick! I love it!
In singleplayer, large battles like Hoth could span hundreds of meters.   Other major, planetary offensives could be when these grand battles take place, and when the story develops.   Other than that, side battles involving skirmishes on outposts, covert missions of sabotage, or ones of retrieval (like Extraction),  could take place on between these battles of epic scales.
GAP IS CLOSING BOYS.  between faker's dick and jensen's ass
Hopefully C9 keeps their heads up, they can still make it out of the group. Jensen played awfully and the Lee pick was questionable. Still think we can do well!

This is really good. good job doing these.   It is really amazing seeing the dice write the narrative.  Knowing a little dnd backstory the skull was probably BY FAR the most important natural 1.  gith are almost 80% evil and the rare chance you find one that aren't evil then they must be neutral so i doubt they would care about anything of your plight there is not such thing as a "good gith"   that skull was a game changer. with out doubt in a really bad way. 
Galavant and Game of Thrones. I just want to see hilarious musical interludes in Game of Thrones. Plus, Tad Cooper vs Drogon.
I agree, but we aren't talking to someone currently volunteering to market the game for free. A few of those folks are still hanging around so have at it.
Because he's a globalist cuck.
going to give this a try because overwatch just pisses me off lolol.
Inb4: you know what 
This Faker guy is pretty good. He could be a world champ or somethin'.
Dapper as fuck.
Is completely irrelevant to this discussion. You're assuming that if say, a successful, happily married, 40 year old businessman was raised by a single mother, they're likely to be a criminal or whatever.   That's not the case. What is the case is that very few people raised by low-income single mothers go on to be happily married businessmen. But once you are, your upbringing is irrelevant, you've outgrown it if you will.
So then your hint was false because I would have to close my eyes.   *She looked down at her feet.*   And its not so much sleep as passing out a few times a week. But I didn't know that anyone knew about that..
Absolutely. I think that adds to the thrill. You not only nailed the timing, but you've *nailed it multiple times*.

Pat is a great owner because he can get players and build great teams. He has a pretty cold and all-business personality though. 
Most professors do not tolerate that if they know you are withdrawing from the class. Usually there is a policy explicitly stated in the syllabus that if you are not enrolled in the course, you should not be there. However, if it's a large class (more than 100), there probably won't be repercussions if you sit in the back and don't make yourself known. It doesn't matter if you already paid for the class, once you are no longer enrolled, most policies are strict about people just sitting in classes willy-nilly. 
what happened to hail runes?
First rise should be about 2 hours at room temp or overnight in the fridge. Second (shaped) rise should be 2 hours at room temp. If the first rise uses up all the sugars there won't be a second rise, so don't over proof.

holy moly, Meteos mechanics are so bad
None of the changes have been an improvement, just new additions to churn out another year of fucking dross. Passing is pathetic, I honestly the guy who coded passing in Fifa 17 is made homeless.
It's not
Well Meeteos is not Rush. His Lee was as useless as the ones in my soloq games

I just put $20 on The Gomper's nose in the 8th at Santa Anita.
lets just remember that we all entertained the notion that joey bosa wouldnt play any games for us this season before getting too pissed about this
"Mid die." -Faker
I would rather fuck your mom than you. But i should have used a CONDOM and then this showerthought would have ended in the garbage instead.   - Dad
My Gold just ran out TODAY, so I'm hoping it works for you! 
I did this as well. The screen size change is the most notable change. Don't really use the 3d. And the ability to play snes games of course. 
The 6th edition of SKT vs Dynamic Queue was nice :)
I got the same thing.   I think it may be Flub. And strong stuff at that.   I was offered a reship or refund. 
I think the January window could be fairly lucrative for us this season. With no players locked from Europe,  we could see some big clubs take a run at several players.   But I agree we shouldn't be strengthening at the moment the rebuild if it happens, happening in January can only be bad.
fingers crossed!
well..... that was something..
Funny thing about that. My brother got a job working for a company that helped people sign up for Obamacare through the Obamacare website. What struck out to me, is that they hired people who had felonies to work there.   Thats right. Convicted felons handled PII. They had access to people's social security numbers, bank accounts, etc.   How did i find out about this? My brother is a convicted felon.   I didnt like Obamacare before finding that out, but that really made me upset after I found out about it. Thank god I don't have to use it. (ret. military) I cant wait till Trump is in office and gets rid of it all together. 
How we perform in post is production is an excellent question. When we built our visual model, we calibrated the video visually indistinguishable at a standard viewing distance.  This distance is different for different resolution videos...so we made a knob which can be turned based on the desired viewer experience (if you don't mind geeking out, it's we call it the visiBel...which is the visual equivalent  of the deciBel.  We validated the model using expert viewers and standard uncompressed test clips.  So, we feel confident that it would great for post production. However, we'd love to hear your opinion (a sanity check is alway welcome)
The most one sided game as of yet.
Transverse ocarina fingering is pretty straight forward. Mind your breath pressure. Be sure to practice with a tuner so you develop a habit of playing on the correct pitch. It's not always easy to recognize when you're playing a quarter tone flat. 
&gt; About #3, doesn't that run the risk of ad hominem and prejudice, rather than considering the merits (or non-merits) of the position that person holds?   There's plenty of places in both the old and new testaments where we are instructed to avoid false teachers -- this doesn't only mean false teach-ings, but teach-ers. Admittedly this might be more related to application (a false teacher will mainly tell you to apply true doctrine in an untrue manner) than actual theology, which your question relates to.  A very stark example is a teaching coming from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Science and Reason compared to one coming from e.g. John Piper. Even if both offer an explanation that's textually and logically sound, credence should be given to the faithful believer rather than those who openly wage war against God.  &gt; is the past popularity or non-popularity relevant to whether a position is within orthodoxy or is heretical? Some popularly-held positions may be false while less-popularly-held positions may be true.  I would say relevant but not necessarily decisive. It's important to understand why people understood what they did; though we're not forced to agree with it. Specifically, we need to uncover the biblical truth (if any) which would be the underlying reason for a specific custom or teaching. I don't know who I'll trigger, but consider the EFS hierarchy-in-trinity discussion. Christianity - neither Catholic nor Protestant, has really dared venture and discuss and make assumptions about the character or nature of the trinity; it's mostly been a bunch of negative statements.
Everything was checked except for the last section which was UnifiedNlp. It confused me because the way I got to that screen was to click on Run in FDroid on the ug UnifiedNlp (No GAPPS) app in the first place.  My best guess is probably I botched the removal of the original Google apps in ES Root Explorer. Probably I'll have to do it the hard way via ADB.
Casting too, in my experience. It's great to bait them into a trade for half their HP when they have a straightsword. Profaned and Sacred Flame seem to be the best for this.  Back to topic, slow weapons definitely take some getting used to and I've fought my fair share of people who know what they're doing. I gotta agree it's baiting, trading and prediction. (Don't trade with a UGS, I learned the hard way ;-; )
Faker died once. What a scrub.
