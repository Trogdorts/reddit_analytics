&gt;I'm curious, how do you see, beyond defining the legislative vs judicial role the constitution specifies, the SOCUS wiping their ass with the constitution.  Read the decision man. The judges admit that they did and they say right in the decision that unlike every other supreme court decision before or since this particular one could never be used as precedent.  It's a singular decision. In the entire history of our nation there has never been another decision like it.

The greatest historic instigator of human divisiveness is religious groups imposing their religious beliefs on others. Non-believers have been persecuted for thousands of years. What atheists say about Christians is typically derided, but what Christians say about atheists is considered "sensible". Individuals may point out the atrocities or ridiculousness of religions be they of a different religion or none, but as a group atheists have no power or influence. Therefor your claim that non-believers bash Christians is laughable.

Anyone who can think clearly can look at religion, the big picture, it's net effect on the world and understand that when you focus on just the extremes you miss the real cause. Treat the disease not the symptoms. Ever watched House MD? Even seen him diagnose someone and find out what the root cause is instead of just prescribing pain killers for pain?  It's the same thing, I see beyond the symptoms, I see the cause and even when it tries to look white and fluffy I still recognise it as cancer.

Listen to the song, and it'd tell you what a bitch is.  =Forget the song, cuz I ain't no bitcch  -I didn't say you were a bitch  =Screw you nigga  -Screw you bitch

Aha, a little further digging in the thread, and from another redditor's comment, proves my point. This isn't about languages, it's about a newbie programmer making a stab at the soft underbelly of some "efficient", but messy code.  Dmitry was a bit foolish to tell a bunch of C programmers to switch to C++ (like telling an emacs to switch to VI, or Linux developer - why not use Windows), and there was Linus to vent, but it seems like the guy had some good points, just didn't say it in a politically correct way.  This is not Linus comment, but it's on the same thread, and I think this is where the truth of the matter is:  On 07/09/07, Dmitry Kakurin &lt;dmitry.kakurin &lt;at&gt; gmail.com&gt; wrote: &gt; My goal is to *use* Git. When something does not work *for me* I want &gt; to be able to fix it (and contribute the fix) in *shortest time &gt; possible* and with *minimal efforts*. As for me it's a diversion from &gt; my main activities. &gt; The fact that Git is written in C does not really contribute to that goal.  That's just it -- Git's goal isn't to make it as easy as possible for Git _users_ to fix it (thought that is a nice thing to have). Git's goal is to be a very good, very fast SCM. Bugs should be found and fixed, but that can most effectively be done by the people who are already knowledgeable about Git's codebase (i.e. its developers), not its users.  And here's someone who has tried to go through the git source.  His comments are understandable, since my understanding is that git was written in a real hurry, when, due to licensing issues with BitKeeper's developer, McEvoy, Linus (who somewhat idiotically, was totally against SCMs for _years_ before finally selecting BitKeeper for Linux)  Hmm, git is not even that portable (doesn't work on Windows well), so I'll subtract the 1 pt for portability I gave to C.  Granted, this is a very very tricky issue, no one gets it right, although Java, and a few others Eclipse, and Qt are about as close as you can get. http://pcapriotti.wordpress.com/2007/10/08/some-thoughts-on-git/

Ok. Here's what you do. Get some speaker wire and either coil it into loops of ~3.5ft or cut strips of the same length. You'll want a good handful of strips or loops. Now strip the insulation from the last foot or so. Take a knife and run it up &amp; down the exposed wire (think barber sharpening razor). Do this until metal splinters begin to form. Repeat for each loop. Now here's the tricky part. Do you fish? Your swatting motion should result in the splinters sticking into your child's delicate skin. Wrist motion is important. You should feel a certain resistance when you try to bring the wire back in preparation for the next strike. This should be similar to the sensation when you first realize you have a fish on your line. If this doesn't occur, then keep trying. Practice makes perfect. A skilled individual will be able to remove little chunks of flesh with each swat.

There are pointer constructs that make such tasks in C++ a *lot* easier. The first that comes to mind is boost::shared_ptr. One of the major powers of C++ is that it, as a language, supports the creation and use of facilities like this to manage the not-so-nice things about working with raw pointers.

ralphwiggum picked a bad example, but porn doesn't have to be extreme to be unrealistic. The positions they use in porn look good for the camera, but they pretty much range from boring to painful in terms of how they actually feel for women. Then women end up getting treated like prudes just because they prefer positions that will actually get them off.  edit: typo

You are all wrong.  "Ad hominem" comes from bacon wrapped hominy pie making.  Bacon is wrapped around hominy and fried.   The ancient bacon hominy pie makers were heard to say: "ad hominem" to his assistant, meaning "add hominy in them". Scheese...  Programmers...
Yeah, I've contemplated that quite a bit as well. I guess the most unnerving thing is  the incomprehensibility of it all.

No, the fires wouldn't go out of control because the military has firefighting capabilities. So the soldiers have to divert forces away from riot suppression and onto fire suppression. The point is to split up the forces most able to put down a revolution.

There's some controversial stuff in this post but it's at least thoughtful and thought-provoking.  Why all the downvoting?  Let me add something: apparently in ancient Greece, "homosexuality" was a fairly open and/or widespread thing.  That suggests a number of possibilities.  It suggests that environment plays a greater role in people's expression of their sexuality than may be politically correct to openly proclaim right now.  It also suggests that the human psyche is complex enough that sexual preference is not fixed even within one lifetime, but something malleable.  IOW, one thing it suggests is that bisexuality in varying degrees and manifestations is quite widespread, and that in contemporary American culture it is nearly glamorized amongst women while rather discomfortingly downplayed, minimized, repressed or ignored amongst men.  Many people are stuck in some simplistic either/or thinking, suggesting that if they have some sort of positive sexual association with someone of the same gender, that means they are !GASP! . . . gay.  I rather doubt that this way of thinking is psychologically plausible, and somehow bisexuality amongst women is not confused with outright lesbianism.  My guess is that human psychology is such that many people are what I think is termed pansexual.  They get turned on by sexuality in all sorts of ways and it isn't a simple gay/straight thing or even a matter of how people decide to specifically act out or express their response.  The Greeks seemed to have ways of rationalizing much of this in terms of seeking higher or more refined pleasures in response to the character of the person rather than mere passion.

A Bush neo-con has admitted that Bush said on this date in 2002 that war with Iraq was "inevitable", even though WMD inspectors had yet to report their findings.

Would you accept a slightly higher risk of being a victim of a terrorist attack in exchange for the knowledge that your government *does* torture?  Middle-Eastern terrorists don't "hate freedom", believe it or not, they hate US-meddling in their affairs. I'm pretty sure they see torturing them as meddling taken to an extreme.

Fourth sons by the same biological mother have something like a 50% occurrence of homosexuality.  I forget the exact number, but I've seen those studies too.  &gt; There's also evidence that gay men are more likely to have very fertile sisters. That might suggest homosexuality is just a harmless by-product of an evolutionary advantageous trait.  Either way it occurs more frequently -- proportionately speaking -- in dense population centers.
Damn, guess that's what happens when you carry all that raw muscle weight and just let it atrophy.

I think the prevailing message in Star Trek concerning money is that a advanced enough civilization would have no need for money, although some excerpts say other wise.   The largest source of confusion for me has always been the house Kirk remembers in "Generations".  For starters if one were to draw the conclusion that the Federation was some sort of socialist nation one should also assume that housing is alloted by the state and that barring any grandiose variation by say a "party official" or something, that all domiciles be more or less the same. Although the fact that Kirk had a beautiful two story house up in the mountains completely nullifies the concept of state alloted housing in the Federation, namely in the sence that why would one citizen, who one would assume has the same intrinsic value of another, be given such a residence while another is given a small studio apartment in the Mission District of San Fransisco. (Non Sequitur. *VOY*) Although I agree with the author of the article that Federation credits are an easy way to explain commerce with other civilizations, the very idea of Captain Picard cashing a pay check every week is preposterous.

I certainly hope that when you dispense these non-ideological corrections, that you disclose the fact that your correction is based on a badly written article about a paper that hasn't yet undergone peer review.
&gt;Nor did this prosperity flow only to a select class of privileged persons. On the eve of the World War the worker in the industrial nations of Europe, in the United States, and in the overseas dominions of England lived better and more graciously than the nobleman of not too long before. Not only could he eat and drink according to his desire; he could give his children a better education; he could, if he wished, take part in the intellectual and cultural life of his nation;  Mises must have had his head far, far, far up his anus.  If you were perhaps, a Bureaucrat or an Aristocrat, sure. But the majority, the working class, were most certainly not able to do much of any of the things listed.  In fact, many of them were starving to death before being sent off to war to fight for the very douchebags who run the system today.  Prosperity my ass. What the rest of us have, and had, is nothing more than a pittance, just barely enough to keep us sustained while the few middle class people capitulate to either one side or the other depending on how well they do.  I think you ought to go back and actually look at why Socialism spread across Europe in the way it did. Hint: It wasn't because people were prosperous.
I work at a school district and just spent a few weeks preparing 15 Mini 9 netbooks for student use, so I got to work with them quite a bit. You don't have a whole lot of vertical screen real estate (the resolution is 1024 x 600), but it's not too bad. Definitely not a show stopper. Really the only concern is, as previously mentioned, the keyboard. At first I was way slower than I was on a normal keyboard, but after a couple days, I was about as fast. The main things I dislike are that you have to use the Fn button to use any of the F1 - F12 keys (and you need a BIOS update to make the F11 and F12 keys work in the first place, although they should be shipping with the latest BIOS now) and the placement of the apostrophe key isn't the greatest. But, like I said, I got used to it. The whole time I was working with them, I was thinking it would be great to own one for myself. They're quite sleek.

&gt; /r/atheism is a group.  No, no it is not.

I am an atheist, but I don't define myself with it. I do not think about it, care about it, or give a flying fuck about (a)theism unless someone asks my opinion on it.  Really, there are much better things to do with my time than sit there and stew over nonsense.  (edit: forgot /n between quote/non-quote portions )

&gt;Dude, there is zero difference between static_cast&lt;foo&gt; and (foo). Zero. But its the only cast I ever see used in C++.  [No it isn't](http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keywords/casting_comparison). staticcast is for explicit coercion. reinterpretcast is for interpreting between unrelated types. C-style cast can do either under different circumstances, and with enough dereference and address operators, might not do what you think it should. Try compiling this on your favorite C++ compiler:  &gt;unsigned a, b, c;  &gt;float f = 1.0f;  &gt;// a-ok - I hope you're trying to manipulate bits though...  &gt;a = *(unsigned *)&amp;f;   &gt;// doin' dandy, and still manipulating bitfields...  &gt;b = *reinterpret_cast&lt;unsigned *&gt;(&amp;f);  &gt;// compile error!  &gt;c = *static_cast&lt;unsigned *&gt;(&amp;f);  But as an "uber-C++ guru", you knew this already, and  you were just testing us, right? ;-)  &gt; The C programmer you mention shouldn't be doing C++. He doesn't know it and he sucks at C too.  This is my problem with Linus' argument, and yours. 75% of all programmers, no matter what language they use, shouldn't be programming.   The incompetent C++ programmers stumble around creating deep inheritance hierarchies, make liberal use of operator overloading (uggh), wrap the wrong things when encapsulating and sink everyone in endless Get'ters and Set'ters, and code everything as a singleton. The REALLY dangerous ones create stuff like much of what's in Boost - where you can look at a line of code and not have any idea what strange template wizardry is working behind the scenes, and then you don't really know the cost of any operation you perform.  The incompetent C programmers (they do exist - surprise Linus!) are cowboys. They don't understand their own fallibility and code as though their code couldn't fail. Do they assert() religiously when accessing arrays? Do they build test cases every time they build a new container? Do they build their code with testing in mind at all? Not in my experience.  So are there more incompetent C++ programmers than C programmers? Based on the people I've taught, interviewed, and worked with, no.  &gt;None - the program would have crashed if I'd done that  Oh, I only wish! Wait until you start working in a large code base and your program dies in an assert in the heap manager on a free(). Why is your code dying in a free()? Because someone else on your team checked in code 3 months ago that created an array on the heap, and now for some unknown and unpredictable reason the array is too small, the code owning it wrote past the end, and one of the allocation blocks in the heap manager got corrupted. And now you have to find that code. And all of this could have been avoided by using std::vector&lt;&gt;.  Memory stomps, how I love them! And as the language that embraces the dangling pointer like no other, C has plenty of them! A coworker of mine once worked on a game for the Atari ST back in the day when they noticed that a single pixel on the screen was blinking on and off for some reason. It wasn't being rendered intentionally - it was a memory stomp in the video buffer! And they never did find out what it was - their devkits didn't have hardware breakpoints (modern ones do)! Their solution was to overwrite the stomped pixel at the right time in the video refresh!   I hope you and everyone you work with assert() liberally.  &gt; and then concluded that what C++ added to C cost too much for what I got  Like type-safety? Organizational wins like encapsulation? Superior casting operators?  &gt; made development inherently unscalable (it is not possible to know what any one line of C++ will do until you have read the entire codebase)  &gt; and had a rabid following of ninnies that I was tired of working around.  Bad codebase, if that's really true. And it can and is frequently done in C, too. See my 75% rule above.

It isn't enough to downvote the comment that pissed them off they have to keep downmodding unrelated comments so I am unable to post for 7 - 10 minutes.

Stained by the corruption of our authority figures and shady business leaders.  Is this what we're fighting for again?  Where'd our dignity go?  Where's our pride? We're better than the thieves, liars, and crooks that give us the illusion that they have control over our lives.  Free men deserve a form of money that is free from control and one that can be voluntarily chosen.  And it doesn't have to be gold.  What should money be?  What should it represent?  What should it promote? Change you can truly believe in is the kind of change that starts with **you**!

How about if who you had was a distant cousin of his, or heck, just somebody with a similar sounding name?  The tale of how you took and tortured this innocent man will be told a thousand times, and will fuel the hatred against the US many times over. Everybody who *ever* knew this man will forever intensely hate the US. You've just created another terrorist cell where there before was none.
You do know he abandoned us, right?  I mean, I loved the guy, but geez.  What a bummer.
Yes, define pnp, read previous post, explain.
&gt;and you think the Israelis were hoping that wouldn't happen?   Why does this matter?  &gt;They were looking for some kind of response from Lebanon to turn it into another Gaza strip.  So the job of the army when your country is invaded is to try and guess what the enemy is thinking and only fight back if you think they don't want you to fight back.  That is your argument right?  &gt;Lebanon's response to Israel’s attacks were completely just and proper.   Nope.  &gt;To attack Israel would have created much more death and destruction, and for what?  Who said anything about attacking israel?  &gt;What good is that when your land is occupied by the Israelis and half your population is either dead or left the country and the other half fighting each other?  Israel killed a thousand people and left a million people homeless. The army could have reduced that toll.  &gt;Don't kid yourself; Hezbollah couldn't give two shits about Lebanon.  They care more than the lebanese army who are too cowardly to defend the country and certainly more than israel who thinks nothing of massacring them whenever they feel the urge.  &gt;They are Iran’s strongest militant wing bordering Israel.  Awesome. I am glad some people care about the lebanese. They are lovely people and don't deserve being killed by the thousands whenever an israeli PM gets hair up his butt.  &gt;They provoked Israel into attacking them,   Ah the eternal cry of the abuser. "Now look what you made me do".  &gt;If Hezbollah had any vested interest in the maintaining a sovereign Lebanon they should cut their puppet strings from Iran and should not ask to be occupied by Syrians.  They fought back against israel and by and large kicked their asses.  There is nothing wrong with asking for help and weaponry from iran and syria. I wish somebody would give them nuclear weapons so they could deter israel forever.  Imagine that. Imagine a lebanon which could never be attacked by israel.  Wouldn't that be a great day? All it would take is a couple of nukes.

I would bet the vast majority of people have no idea what linux is, let alone it's free and a great alternative. The software isn't bad, in fact it's perfectly fine for basic things like email, writing papers, security, and every other basic thing a school lets kids do. I would say the issue is knowledge of options, not quality of software.

I don't think you understand what investing for the long term means.  Here are three long term strategies:  1) Pick individual stocks.  Pick companies that are undervalued (lower P/E) and are starting to pay a dividend, or are at least profitable/likely to pay a dividend.  Generally you want to look for companies where signs indicate they have room to grow (within their sector) and appear to have good management.  If the price drops but the company's fundamentals are strong, buy more.  Otherwise hold or sell.  Reinvest all the dividends.  As you get older (towards the age when you desire this money) transition towards less risky investments, such as bonds or money market funds.  When a stock looks strongest and overvalued (high P/E after a long rise) is the best time to sell, and roll the money into another stock or bonds and money market funds as needed.  2) Invest in index funds/ETFs or mutual funds.  Choose growth oriented, small cap funds at first, eventually bonds, and money market funds.  3) Choose a target date mutual fund.  Vanguard offers some funds with a "target retirement" date... the fund gradually alters its makeup amongst various stocks and bonds as the risk tolerance changes.  It is short term investors who are focused on the stock price and capital gains who get trapped by the portfolio crashing, because they end up selling at the bottom...

If you're against globalization, you don't know economics. If you protect a domestic industry, the other domestic industries that use the protected industry's products as an input will be less competitive. Protectionism costs jobs.  It is perfectly reasonable (and correct in my opinion) to want all products sold in America to be produced under the same environmental and labor standards. This article is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Our free trade agreements should require that certain regulations are put in place so we're not shipping industries overseas just so the environment can be polluted somewhere else and other workers can be mistreated.  Yes, globalization costs American jobs in the short term, but protectionism costs American jobs in the long term.

good article!
One:  Is that an attempt to attack me?  That was amusing.  I researched DynCorp and brought out what I found, big whoop?  I don't Google everything under the sun with the tag "hoax" to it.  Since you seem to extensively lack all forms of reading comprehension [beyond being a Bible-thumper], lemme explain: I don't Google, "DynCorp hoax" or "Bill of Rights hoax" when looking things up.  I just knew about that particular website, marryourdaughter.com, and made reference to it.  I was shown it was a hoax in a courteous manner from another member, whereas you flipped out because I mentioned they were supposedly a "Christian-based form of slavery."  Get over yourself, you're not impressing anyone by repeating what someone else already posted, and overly exaggerating it. Two:  I didn't cover all of Christianity, you stupid witless fuck.  Reread my post, if you can get past being so haughty that I am not pro-Christianity, and realize that I was explaining that the website used the Bible as defense for selling off their daughters.  I didn't make *any* claims that all Christians did this, you stupid fuck.  God damn dude, I can't believe you're so fucking ignorant.  Did you actually *read* what I stated?  Obviously not...  Three: You want a biscuit for re-explaining the history behind the website?  I already read the article on how the website was a hoax and what it was intended for.  Are you that desperate to look intelligent to as to reiterate something that was already completely covered?  You're acting like hot stuff for really trying to stick it to me over one thing.  Get over yourself, or pat yourself on the back.  Either way, you're still a dipshit with no reading comprehension. So in Conclusion: You're hopping piss mad because I'm not pro-religion.  Get over it.  You ever read the Bill of Rights?  That First Amendment is a real hum-dinger!  If you're unhappy that someone doesn't powder your ass about Christianity, then grow up.  Learn to understand that not everyone will agree with your religion/line of thinking/opinion.  And yes, go read up on your Bible, because obviously you're too damned stupid to look anything up regarding it.  You made a sad attempt to mock me over using Google, but you yourself probably have never looked up via that same web power the many contradictions and problems of the Bible. So *you* need to get off your high horse and realize that bantering around because someone made a comment about Christianity doesn't mean you should make an ass of yourself.  I said "1" thing about Christianity, that was it.  I didn't make a blanket comment, you jack ass.  Obviously you've been bashing your head into your bible that your brain just simply isn't functioning properly anymore.  Grow up, and learn to deal with the fact not everyone is Christian.  Boo-fucking-hoo, ya wanker.

Also, I see no reason the waiters couldn't be holograms, or non-Federation citizens maybe? I know the UFP has some kind of trial period for new member planets, so there must be some kind of immigrant-analogue.  Edit: Not to be crass, but they could actually *be* retarded.

I've heard a lot of musicians argue that piracy devalues music. If you had to spend $10 on it you'd give it more of a chance. If you get it for free you don't care as much.  I think that isn't right. It seems like they're arguing that the value of music is artificial. That the value only actually comes from the listed dollar amount. I guess more expensive art means better art to a lot of people, but anyone who has ever been loaned a book or read one at a library can tell you that isn't true.  Maybe it sends a bad message to promoters and advertisers, but actual musicians and music lovers, in my mind, should be nothing but inspired.

The trick to lucid dreaming is to fall asleep but not too deeply.  The method I've found that works best for me is to sleep about 6 hours at night and then take a 2 hour nap after work.  That nap seems to produce a higher than normal amount of dreams where I'm cognizant of my mental state.  It also helps to recognize and study the stages of sleep and know when to recognize a light sleep without jolting yourself awake.  Sort of like surfing the theta stage.  http://web.mst.edu/~psyworld/sleep_stages.htm

First, you need to look up "truism."  It doesn't mean what you think it means.  C++ is *monotonically* faster than C.  There are no cases where the same code runs slower, but there are (several) cases where code can be written significantly faster in C++ than in C.  That's sufficient for saying that "C++ is faster than C."
the examples you give involve atheist-bashing, but their purpose is to instill this idea that it is oh so dangerous and courageous to be an atheist in this age of fundamentalism. get over yourself. believe whatever you want, but don't take anything too seriously, especially a metaphysical belief based on empirical evidence that cannot rationally be disproved by empirical evidence even though empirical evidence is never absolute anyway... that's atheism. nothing wrong with it just like there's nothing wrong with believing in the flying spaghetti monster so long as you don't harm people.

That's exactly why I like it too. I love picking out the perfect gift for every friend and family, I love the ritual of it, I love that everything around you transforms into festivities for a whole month, and joy seems to be in the air. I love the trees and the lights and the smells of pine and snow and cinnamon and seeing that your neighbors and strangers you don't even know are celebrating the same thing you are, and sharing in it. I love Christmas Eve, sitting by the tree with my family and squinting your eyes so the lights seem to twinkle, and you think of all the wonderful memories you've had at times just like this. And you think back on your year, whether it was good or bad, and it just feels like a nice closure to everything.  A lot of it is nostalgia, but that's not for nothing. I do feel lucky that the vast majority of my Christmases have been good and I have a family to share it with who feels the same way I do.
Deserts aren't always hot, and this one is at 3000'. I highly doubt this is the first time there's been snow.
The early investors did not make "huge profits"; they were only getting 10-12% per year.  That's an above-average return, but not worth the risk if you knew you were investing with a crook.
Crap, and a whole lot of lawyers.
I am disappointed, no one is claiming that, this is a pattern that represents the white people. Every time some dumb story about black Americans or Muslims or Arabs comes up, the competition starts for the worst generalisation. At times it seems that posters are trying their best to outdo one another, on who can post the dumbest most racist generalisation. So yes, totally disappointed :) 
"It was not until a mention of her in The Robots of Dawn, Asimov's third Elijah Baley Robot novel, that the events of her era (the 21st century) were concretely tied into those of Baley's era, at least two-and-a-half millennia further into the future, and thus into the greater Foundation universe as a whole."

&gt; What the rest of us have, and had, is nothing more than a pittance, just barely enough to keep us sustained I'm not going to have anything to do with an illusion this complete.
Yes, the good ole "Automatic Teller Machine" sex act.  Some women have such good control, that they can actually shoot the stack of $20 bills so far that they hit the wall on the opposite side of the room. (Note: Don't use real magstripe cards, they're too sharp to use internally.)
I grew up extremely poor.  When I was 16, I asked my mother for a new toothbrush. She said no. Couldn't afford it. I recall being very upset to have to continue to use this 'old' toothbrush. After some time, I developed tonsillitis. It was an aggressive form and I had to take massive doses of antibiotics. My mother still refused to get me a new toothbrush. By the time I'd had the tonsillitis a 3rd time, they were taken out. I told the surgeon my fear. He gave me a new toothbrush and insisted my mother throw my old one away.
&gt;I would be a shitty automechanic. If someone brought the car to me and said "My car won't start." 'Well, maybe there's a killer after you!"  -Mitch Hedberg
Yes, I don't.
&gt; Riiiiiight, because if someone were so much more evolved than you that they could only see 90% of the world as an entirely different species with whom it's extremely difficult if not impossible to communicate with then it follows that they would NOT show hostility. This makes absolute perfect sense.  So, your shortcoming is not being able to communicate with 90% of the human population and it is *them* that is unevolved? Riiiiiiiight. I just think you need to learn about communication. Do me a favor. Define communication for me. What does it mean to communicate with somebody?  &gt; And this gross and extreme misunderstanding proves that you're an idiot, certainly far inferior to me cognitively.  Do me a favor and shove your e-cock back in your little Spongebob underpants and then attempt to explain (yeah, communication involves explaining) why the pliability of the English language is somehow an "extreme misunderstanding". I don't think you realize who you're talking to.   &gt; And this, as if the fact that you are an idiot weren't enough indication, proves you don't know what the fuck you're talking about regarding morality.  How?  &gt; In other words, you're talking about a subset of intellectual morality that crosses with psychological maturity, cretin. One that doesn't require general intellectual maturity nor general psychological maturity, let alone emotional maturity at all.   No... see those don't mean anything to me. And I'll explain.  &gt; You are far less mature than I am. Even if I granted your own claims of maturity, which I don't. You're also far stupider and more idiotic than I am since you rejected the categories I gave you instead of assimilating them.  More mature than me? Of course, to that, I won't argue, but let me explain to you my conception of maturity. An excerpt from my book:   "Maturity is knowledge of corruption and injustice; a loss of innocence; a hatred for reality due to it’s unrelenting oppression. We need to abolish all falsehoods regarding adulthood and maturity. We may act differently, but that is only by way of bitterness, desensitization, and necessity. It is only by way of interacting with a sick and confused culture."  Your maturity is a ruthlessness. It's a complete lack of sympathy. It's an absence of morality. How about that, Mr. Homo Moralis? Heh.  &gt; Mere biological survival isn't worth having.   That's your own personal opinion. See, you've got to segregate what you believe from what everyone else believes. Quit projecting your own inner state out onto everyone else. You haven't learned to do that yet?  &gt; They don't.  They do? WTF? Why even type that?  &gt; So you admit it!!  Uh, yeah. I've kind of been saying that all along; that I'm not a primitivist. You see, I'm not a confused solipsist objectivist like yourself. I can (*gasp*) actually see merit in other peoples' opinions.   &gt; You don't even know how old the human species is? And you're not ashamed to admit it?  I'll just copy and paste what you were responding to, but this time highlight the operative word that your mind just seemed to pass over enthusiastically and uncomprehendingly: "our **ancestors** did do it for hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of years."  Were all our ancestors human, redditcensoredme?
Her's the answer I gave to theantirobot:  Yes, of course. But we're not talking about you and me. The press only reports on *new* studies.  &gt;Good evening, this is Brian Williams. A new study released today says that marijuana has multiple medical uses. Marijuana legalization advocates are arguing that it should be legalized for medical use. For more on the story we take you now to Andrea Mitchell who has more on the story.  It would be great if the real world influenced people more. But in reality, the mediated world influences people more. That's why I advocate this course of action.

Hope for the future, or things getting better, is a great start.  From there, you can work out the details.  Exercise does help!  I find that I like exercise that *means something* to be more enjoyable.  That is, flag football is fun, but running on a treadmill just seems pointless.  Games, martial arts, and dancing are all good, fun ways to start exercising more regularly.
&gt;I think you're really not trying to understand and you're just arguing to argue.  No I'm not. Argue with me why I should be nice to religious people? I don't go around fucking with kids, gays or anyone else in society or mess with anyone's life. I live and let live and I believe in equal rights for everyone, gay, women, any human. We've tolerated religion for too long. Argue with me why I should not say enough is enough and be intolerant towards religious people.

I have two members you can talk to right now that make a hell of a lot more sense then you just did ... I notice your not hot footing it right over there to talk to them ... Truth is your just some wuss that knows jack doodly about structural engineering period ... Where are your credentials?? "The vast majority of the hundreds of thousands of architects and engineers worldwide agree with the official findings" ... That's a flat out lie .... "Where's the internet list of scientists that agree with the theory of evolution" ... Is a pathetic attempt on your part to shift the conversation .... "AIA is aware of Gage's little side project. They made him take their logo off ae911twoof" ... and it looks to me like they just got paid for it to .... But it still has jack diddly to do with WTC demolition .... That building was demolished ... PERIOD ... So either come on over to my blog and learn something from the experts themselves or @#%$ off!! ... I know what the @#%$ I'm talking about!!! 
Thanks for that.  Makes the guy sound sort of Hunter S. Thompson-esque.  Minus drugs.
It's just like our real world economy. The important people don't have to worry about money. Everything just happens for them.  Those who are hustling just trying to make a buck are lampooned.

Yeah, but I'm saying that, on the subconscious level at least, it looks better because of the image of self-confidence it gives off.
Christians think that anyone disagreeing with their view on religion and god is "bashing".  Once somebody posts a dissenting opinion, they scream and whine and moan about how they're being "bashed", as if (ludicrously) they were an oppressed minority of some sort.

&gt; You wanted everyone to presuppose your meaning of "initiate violence" meant the same thing to all people. It doesn't. Why doesn't it? I can't ask "all people", but I can ask you. I really mean it, please tell me why using the OED definition of words is wrong. &gt; Secondly, and most importantly, you can declare every situation I laid forth as morally wrong from the safety of your keyboard, but as I simply stated earlier (which you took the liberty to wilfully ignore), many people would disagree.  I can't speak to your nebulous "many people", but I can speak to you. You're making a claim - you should be prepared to support your claim from your own perspective, without needing to claim support from "other people". &gt;I would take dollars to donuts you would make many of the same "immoral" choices when faced with the alternative consequences. Now you're claiming to be able to foresee my actions. Why don't you take my words at face value, at least until you have reason to suspect I'm a coward or am lying. &gt;And what this really shows is morality is more relative than you may wish to believe. The black and white world will break down once your exit your safety zone. I'm more aware of nuances than most people I debate with. I think you're on thin ground here. &gt; PS: nice cop out on the last example, but replace aliens with fascist/communist government agents and you may just do the same for your child. Let me see if I've got this right: &gt; Immediately following the battle with the invading army, some innocents are offered shelter in a basement by a man who lost his family during the invasion. The aggressing army settle close to the house where they are hiding and tensions start to emerge between homeowner, who wants to strike back at the invaders, and pacifist who is preoccupied with his own safety and that of his daughter. The pacifist wants to hide until the invaders move off to a different area. Meanwhile the invaders begin doing evil deeds  with human remains. The home defender begins to exhibit signs of mental stress. Later that night, an aggressor solider invades the basement, where the three manage to escape detection. A small contingent of foreign soldiers then enters and explore the house, even examining photographs of their home inhabitants while the pacifist struggles to stop the home defender from attacking the soldiers, until a siren emitted by the army commander summons them to return. The home defender cracks mentally after witnessing one of the soldiers molesting a helpless human victim. The pacifist, concerned that the commotion the home defender is creating might draw the attention of the soldiers to himself and his daughter, makes the decision to murder the home defender and thereby silence him. Nope. No Change. Murdering the home defender is still a moral wrong. I would not do it. &gt; PPS: notably you let your people starve as well for the wealthy land owners. I guess letting people die for profit isn't a form of violence. No-one has the right to steal food, even if they are starving to death. I can and do help people who are hungry. But I do that voluntarily and I appeal to others to help out voluntarily as well. But I would never use violence to compel others to give up their food - that would be a moral wrong.

Nah, I'm fine with it... Besides, I didn't call you an idiot or anything.  I was likening your "why do you hate freedom?" sycophancy and idolatry of the money grubbers and the status quo to Sean Hannity.  He throws out that same "freedom" line all the time.  It is meant to make the person making the statement look somehow more patriotic than the person they are engaged in dialogue with, so it is really a form of attempted character assassination.  It is usually used when there really isn't any good logical rebuttal to the objection to the premise just raised.  And it's just as disingenuous when anyone else does it.  That sort of jingoistic crap needs to be checked when it rears its head.  So the analogy was apropos, I think.

Why are you assuming I have princess fantasies?  Someone who buys a ring for another person is not 'buying' that person. The person is buying a gift, which happens to have additional symbolism, but it does not entail 'purchase' of another person.   It is not a cultural symbol of 'how much money someone is willing to spend.'If anything,it is a symbol of being 'taken' before the marriage actually takes place. What is an engagement anyway? It's a visual symbol. If you don't like it for that reason,that makes sense,but don't make up new ones.

If I want tofu, I want tofu (but I don't actually want tofu).

Crushing dissenting voices is what all this whining about "bashing" is about.  Express a view that doesn't jive with what the religious majority believes and they'll look for a way to shut you down and shut you up.  Here on reddit, the preferred method seems to be to pretend that being religious makes you an oppressed, bullied minority being unfairly shat upon by the Cruel Atheist Brigade(TM).

Yea, I'm an atheist and a vegetarian.  I don't think there's anything wrong with eating meat, BUT, I don't like how animals are treated by today's food factories. I'd rather not be contributing to the funding of those operations, until they clean up their act.  Chickens, for example, are packed by the thousands into cages. In order to cut costs and boost profits, chickens for food production are killed while still baby chicks (6 weeks old). Their natural lifespan is 5 to 10 years.   Since the slaughtered animals are so young and small, it requires far more chickens to to produce all the meat consumed. The US consumes 18 billion chickens a year... that's one chicken each week, for every man, woman, and child in the US.  There are no controls to make sure that the animals die quick and with minimal pain. They are killed by machinery, which may or may not do the job correctly.
I'm a pothead, but I would never recommend using substances as a coping mechanism. If you're drinking to escape from something (emotion, action, conversation, boredom), it's not going to end well. My advice is to scale back to the point where you can go a week without drinking and have it not affect your personality or emotions, then slowly bring it back for entertainment/socializing/relaxation.  Or maybe you should switch substances and see if that helps your temperament ;)  Edit: I was athletic and fit in high school, but then got to college and wasn't forced to work out for football or wrestling and gained about 50 lbs. I'm currently at 5'11" 290 lbs. and while I consider myself "fat," I know that I'm not ruining my body with health risks (yet, I'm 23, so in a few years I *really will* need to start losing weight). I doubt I've gone a week without eating fast food this year, so we're even.

I don't give a damn about the Christian bashing as such. I give a damn about the fact that /r/atheism is no longer a place to go to actually talk about substantive issues atheists face. About how to make progress, or what values we share and would like to encourage.  We're a group of people. We're not a congregation, but we've come together here for a reason. I'd like that reason to be more noble than sitting around and bitching.

How would you recommend to a newbie is the best way to buy precious metals? I don't have anywhere to store them. So what is there to do?
I can completely see your point, I'm somewhat the same way. I don't have any problems with persons who take their religious texts as non-literal; those people are normally decent people who don't try to shove their religion down your throat and are reasonable for the most part. Being an atheist who doesn't hide it to anyone I've had a lot of experience with fundamentalists trying to convert me (mostly people I know who don't understand how rude it is). I never go out and try to 'force atheism' on anybody, but if they ask what I believe in then I'll just tell them.  Point is: being a militant anything is detrimental to your cause.

I would second the Debian recommendation, but also urge you to take the plunge and install Debian Lenny (instead of Etch) because while Lenny is still the "testing" distribution it is edging closer to becoming the "stable" Debian every day and I've moved five computers (servers and laptops) to Lenny recently and it's been great.  Etch is more conservative and won't have the latest greatest versions of some software.  On one of my computers (the most recently purchased laptop) I needed to move to a 2.6.27 kernel in order to get support for the wireless card in there (and I've also had some trouble with suspend on that laptop, but I also haven't done a thing to try to diagnose the issue yet), but otherwise even very new hardware should be well supported on Lenny.  I tried Ubuntu for a while, but got tired of everything being updated almost every day.  I can't have my browser or email app crashing on a regular basis--that's a serious timesink.  Something a little less bleeding edge, but still not stone age is what I prefer and right now Lenny is serving that role nicely.

"There's no denying that the Buffett name piques interest in the art world, where Nicole's pieces have fetched as much as $8000. One of her techniques is to leave unfinished works outside, exposed to the elements. "I like to see what happens," she says, hovering over canvases mottled with sunbursts of color."  Her art sounds like a bunch of horse shit. Not that I would expect less from a neo-hippy. And I seriously doubt she still isn't receiving trickle down money through her family, perhaps to pay for her rent and junk. Maybe Reaganomics does work
&gt;Don't worry scrote. There are plenty of 'tards out there living really kick ass lives. My first wife was 'tarded. She's a pilot now. 
This is "askreddit" not "tellreddit"
&gt;Why is the cleric called "radical" just because he is "Anti-American"?  Why do you assume that he's being called radical because of his anti-Americanism?  There are probably a lot of non-radical anti-American clerics, but there are radical ones as well.

No, you're not simply saying that you dislike it, you are ascribing negative aspects to it in GENERAL and making statements in GENERAL which suggests a closed mind.

I guess I'd never heard that, but every job I've ever had used it to denote [estimated time of arrival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_time_of_arrival).  Common forum speak I suppose, but I would get used to people above 18 asking why you've estimated an arrival time for whatever statement follows the acronym. Not even being snarky, but wherever that comes from (Fark, Digg, 4chan, gamer forums, it has to be coming from somewhere) that I don't go is so *far and away the exception to the ETA rule* it's hard to overstate. If it doesn't bother the writer to explain what they mean every time it's used though, then hey, why would it bother me. :)
You mean preteen, 'teenage' girls would have something like coldplay.  Of course, that's what my genetic algorithm for the human race tells me. I don't actually go outside or anything.

This ain't a lone fraudster, he paid off plenty of people from regulators to his 20 employees to his CPA. The man even flaunted it in our faces, telling us about how he has to be careful in this regulatory environment. He was basically playing everyone and enjoying it along the way.  Until the credit crunch happened and people actually began wanting their money n stuff.

&gt; I just really really hate (as mentioned in the previous post) when gay people go around wanting to be treated the same as everyone else, yet at the same time want to stand out and be different and proud.  I don't interpret "gay pride" that way at all.  I think it's just a natural reaction to the still-existing homophobia within the culture and a way of encouraging people to fight against it and not have to fear coming out.  And with your laid-back attitude on all this, it should really not make much of a difference to you how open people choose to be about their sexuality.  Right now, it's considered perfectly acceptable and mainstream for, say, a Howard Stern to openly express how attractive he finds a woman, whereas you just don't have a comparable phenomenon of open expression by gay people (well, male gay people in particular) about a man.  As long as that culturally-normative difference exists, you're going to see the "gay pride" folks as standing out as being "so open."  But I think their main point is that they are NOT so different and that mainstream culture still makes them out to be.

Googles monopoly of the internet will kill us all
It's like tech support: people are more likely to tell you when they're upset than happy. Don't worry, the happy people are out there, they're just not on reddit right now, commenting about it.
Completely agree. Mind your own fucking business. 
I hear a lot of people (atheist and theist) complain about the atheists on reddit being jerks and being incapable of rational conversations... but then I find myself in the middle of yet another calm, respectful conversation with a Christian or otherwise and get confused.  Back to the point: persecution is an important characteristic of Christianity, and it's only more apparent through most branches of Protestantism. A lot of Christian groups/organizations I was involved with earlier in my life constantly claimed they were the only true Scotsman --  er Christians -- and that the whole evil world was against them... even though there were several thousand members of the congregation and a dozen other churches of similar size in my hometown of only 250,000 people...
It took for EVER to get my daughter interested in the things I hoped she would know; she was afraid of unloaded guns, had absolutely no interest in shooting or hunting. I just barely got her to pay attention in Karate class, and that really bothered me; at 12 she was a getting stared at by guys on the nearby army base, and now, at 16 I feel like I should keep a ax handle handy. Finally, though, at 15 she was trying to think of an interesting way to destroy the teddybear a ex-boyfriend had given her; I suggested the SKS.. she doesn't hunt still, and thats fine, but she can now shoot, clean and load a very wide variety of weapons with more than average competency; hunting is now something she COULD do if she had to. I would post pictures, but I'm not that stupid.

No.

I remember reading stories about doctors who were skeptical about the benefits of washing their hands before working with patients just 150 years ago. I think this might be along the same lines.   Our Grandchildren are going to be shocked to learn that we lived half our life letting our toothbrushes just sitting out in the bathroom... one of the most germ prone rooms in any house.
Get used to it. When you're an non-participant in something the dumber 80% of the world thinks is very important, you might as well have a positive term for your non-participation.  There are lots of Christians who don't go to church, it doesn't make them less Christian.
Radical! I wonder if there are any tubular or groovy clerics?
A friend told me this story once, and I did not believe it at the time, but every now and again, a story like the one you just referenced comes around, and makes me wonder if perhaps I should not have doubted him.  So, as the story goes, he was walking through a parking lot, and passed a woman who was outside her car, crying, and very distressed. He asked if she needed help, and she said that she was locked out of her car.  She was holding the keyless entry remote, and pressing the button, but apparently the batteries must have been dead or something, because the doors were not opening. Adding to her problem, she really needed to be someplace, I think to pick up her kid, hence the crying.  My friend asked if he could see her keys, and she handed over the entire keychain. He took the key, inserted it into the lock, turned it, unlocking the car. Then he opened the door for her, and handed the keys back.
He already said in the first post regarding this topic (which you posted two comments in regards to) that he DOES feel bad about the woman and is considering asking his boss to terminate the payments.  Regardless, however, you have nothing substantial to say that she is mentally ill, and if she were, he still has no obligation to this woman.  It's not even his business; he's a simple employee.
Why was this guy downmodded?  I'm so fucking sick of the Christian trolls going and down-modding to hell everything on most of the atheist sub-reddit pages after the first few initial comments.  Maybe they weren't trolling the forums, I'd take them more seriously?  Whether we view a religion or not as funny doesn't mean we still all can't observe the god-damned First Amendment [sorry non-USA residents, I'm not trying to single you out of the equation].  DanCorb brought out a point here, and that if Christianity is demanding respect, they ought to expect ridicule.  Most often, respect is earned, not demanded.  I agree with him, and shame on the Christian trolls for down-modding everything under the first batch of comments like this...  if they want us to take them seriously, they could post intelligent, thought provoking ideas just like anybody else.  Or, they can go to the Christianity sub-Reddit and leave the damned atheist one alone...  just saying...

Dear Reddit,   After some arguing with my friend, he finally convinced me to try out Twitter (I know, I'm late to the party). As far as I can tell, though, it's like a slightly more advanced version of the Facebook Status Update.  So, have any Redditors found cool uses for Twitter? Networked with interesting new people? There are location-based features, right? That could be cool.  My s/n is HipNihilist. I've updated 3 times... hopefully I'll continue.
&gt; No, the languages themselves, if you try to do the exact same things in both, should run about the same speed  Which means that C++ cannot be *slower* than C, since (modulo some extra, no-runtime-cost casts) you can do the exact same thing in in C++ that you can do in C, at the same speed.  In order for my assertion to be correct, there must only be *one* case where I can write faster code in C++ than in C.  Two examples have been provided: std::sort's ability to inline the comparator function and template metaprogramming (by which, in particular, we're referring to the ability to do compile-time calculation resulting in greater runtime efficiency).  &gt; However, C doesn't encourage that kind of code by making it really hard to do  To listen to its detractors, C++ discourages that kind of code by making it really hard to do as well.  You can't have it both ways: you can't complain that C++ is hard some of the time and then, when it's convenient, complain that it's so easy that it encourages bad programming.  &gt; Now you just have to factor in the ridiculous issues C++ brings in  None of those issues even remotely affect my assertion, which is that C++ is faster than C.  It's irrelevant to bring them up in this thread.  I didn't say C++ was *better* than C, I said that it was *faster* than C.  The complexity of C++ doesn't have anything to do with that claim.  &gt; some penalties for extra type-checking, and it just isn't faster.  There are no penalties for extra type-checking.  There's no runtime cost for `static_cast` or `reinterpret_cast` or `const_cast`, and there's no C analogue for `dynamic_cast`, so its runtime cost can't contradict my assertion.  &gt; In theory, it can be, but it's not worth the effort to make it.  In practice, it *is*.  &gt; Check out the C++ FQA, it goes into a lot of depth, even though a lot of the points it makes are overblown and dramatic.  I've already read it.  It exhibits a clear lack of understanding of the design principles behind C++, but that's a topic for another thread.

Why should we give a shit whether Muslims believe Evolution? Those who do biology need to understand (not "believe") evolution. Goatherders and suicide bombers don't.  Do we get all worked up if people don't believe General Relativity? It makes no difference whether they do or not! Why should disbelief in evolution get our skivvies in a knot?   There's not shortage of smart people who understand Evolution. They come from China, Japan, and India and fill our graduate schools. It's no great loss if Muslims choose to drive camels instead.  Of all the crazy shit that religious nuts do, disbelieving in Evolution is the least harmful to the rest of us.
That sounds very PostSecret.

Your question assumes that torture slightly lowers the risk of terrorism.

Was the U.N. (actually, U.S.) document peer reviewed? Not really.  From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision):  &gt;A meta-analysis of the African randomised controlled trials found that the risk in circumcised males was 0.44 times that in uncircumcised males, and reported that 72 circumcisions would need to be performed to prevent one HIV infection. The authors also stated that using circumcision as a means to reduce HIV infection would, on a national level, require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.[\[125\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#cite_note-124)  In other words, the later review showed the results of the U.N. document to be bogus.
Well, let's say this: people speed. The kid turned in front of oncoming traffic... it's hard to put responsibility totally on the cop. It could have been anyone speeding; the fact that the oncoming car was driven by a police officer doesn't really absolve the kid of responsibility for his own safety while driving.

&gt; Then what the hell are you doing here?  Bored as hell while waiting for a project to finish compiling. All my other subreddits (~60) are purpled out for the first 5 pages.  Thought I would stop in. Is that a problem?  &gt; quantity of people who come together around an issue, idea or cause  I don't know about you, but I have yet to hear of any regularly occuring athiesm-based gatherings. I have heard of people gathering for dances, music, food and fun. I wouldn't for a moment however, classify individuals who enjoy such things as party animals, nor as musicians, chefs, or dancers.  The flaw I see is in your assumption that individuals belong in a group for the sole reason that they agree about something.  (edit: grammar)
Seems like a lack of imagination with gifts then, too. Part of the challenge to me is to really think about what a person would love to have or do, or really have a special meaning to them, that I could give them. It's not just gifts for the sake of it, to me it's supposed to be a symbol, both in object and act, of your bond to this person: you know them well enough to know what they want and you cared enough to really think about it and get it for them. It doesn't have to be some materialistic object... it can be a massage or a "gift certificate" for you to do something for them (wash dishes for the next month or something), or even a donation to a charity in their name. It's the effort you put into it. It can be hard sometimes, but when you nail it, it feels so good.
What do you mean by unroll?
Jesus Christ.  Settle the fuck down.  I was talking about posts like "Anal." and "Sex is bad, mmkay?" that don't add anything useful to the conversation.
Huh, so a company changes what they sell based on demographics.  How terrible.  Edit:  &gt;It's a tough one. What to ask for? There is no material damage that Macy's owes you. Maybe you could ask the CEO to have Pam given a lesson in tact.  What a sense of entitlement.  A worker gave an honest answer, which prompts people to say "What can I ask for from this corporation?"
that also sounded pretty horrible.

I have no love for the state or for government in general, in most things they should get the fuck out of the way.  I have no desire for anarchy either; some government *is* actually necessary and a good thing to live in a peaceful society. Man is not inherently good as most libertarians seem to fool themselves into thinking.   There will always be a biggest baddest gang on the block, the question is do you want them to be totally self chosen by brute force, or at least have some say in the manner via public election, there is no other option. Left alone, the vast majority of humans do not co-exist peacefully, we're violent racist brutal tribal animals who kill each other over such trivial things as who's praying to the correct invisible man in the sky.  Guns are a necessary evil, however, that doesn't mean there can't be limits.  You don't need a 50 caliber machine gun for personal protection, it has one purpose, to kill large numbers of people.  Such things are quite rightfully, illegal for private ownership.
well
&gt; So, your shortcoming is not being able to communicate with 90% of the human population and it is them that is unevolved?  Try to have a meaningful relationship with a pig or teach general relativity to a dog.  &gt; I don't think you realize who you're talking to.  Meanwhile, I KNOW you don't realize who you're talking to. Or even what you're talking about.  &gt; How?  Because "acting morally" means nothing. You can train a dog to "act morally" at your command. REASONING ABOUT morality is what matters. And less than 10% of the population are capable of doing that. And if you make such enormous fucking blunders, and you seem to on a regular basis, then it indicates that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. On any subject.  &gt; "Maturity is knowledge of corruption and injustice; a loss of innocence; a hatred for reality due to it’s unrelenting oppression. We need to abolish all falsehoods regarding adulthood and maturity. We may act differently, but that is only by way of bitterness, desensitization, and necessity. It is only by way of interacting with a sick and confused culture."  This is a bunch of fuzzy-minded crap that means fuck-all. And it again proves that you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. In a whole paragraph, you're able to put in less than 1/10th of the information that I can put in a single sentence. That's what comes out of being an idiot. Your mind is plodding along and barely able to touch on these great big abstract concepts which I see in their entirety in intricate detail. And you expect me to waste my time on you? To condescend to you? And even to lie and dissemble about needing to condescend to you? No, I don't fucking think so.  &gt; Your maturity is a ruthlessness. It's a complete lack of sympathy. It's an absence of morality. How about that, Mr. Homo Moralis? Heh.  It just shows again how much of an idiot you are. For one thing, sympathy and empathy are completely different concepts, and sympathy has absolutely nothing to do with morality. Furthermore, compassion, morality, niceness and altruism are **all different concepts**. Completely independent of each other and having NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER. Someone who cares for morality and ONLY FOR morality WILL BE ruthless, by definition. But you're a cretin, an imbecile, and you do not see that morality logically implies the ruthless destruction of what ought to be destroyed. And that includes amoral and immoral people who are arrogant enough to pronounce themselves on morality.  &gt; That's your own personal opinion. See, you've got to segregate what you believe from what everyone else believes.  Yeah, because I'm an intellectual and I'm homo moralis, so the survival of feral homo sapiens means absolutely nothing to me. But that doesn't make it "just" my personal opinion, it doesn't make it dismissable in any way, shape or form. Because my personal opinion is the **superior** opinion. What dogs and chimps want simply doesn't matter.  &gt; I'm not a confused solipsist objectivist like yourself.  HAHAHAHA, where do you come up with all that bullshit?!  &gt; Were all our ancestors human, redditcensoredme?  My ancestors weren't even homo moralis. And what part of "I don't give a fuck about homo sapiens" is too difficult for your teeny tiny wee brain to comprehend? They're all words of two syllables or less, I don't think I can make them all one syllable.

It matters because its in Israel’s best interest to see a divided Lebanon.   My argument is there is no point in fighting an army much larger than yours. My point is by fighting the IDF which was invited in my Hezbollah would be devastating to everyone.   How exactly could the Lebanese army have responded to Israel without attacking it? What other response is there? There was no way to reach South Lebanon because both Hezbollah and the IDF would not allow it.  How exactly could the army reduce the toll if Hezbollah doesn’t even allow it to operate in south Lebanon?  The Iranians couldn't give a shit about the Lebanese, don't kid yourself. They only want to suppress Israel at much as possible, and if that comes at the price of Lebanese sovereignty, they don't care.  "Ah the eternal cry of the abuser. "Now look what you made me do"." Israel responded to kidnapped soldiers...  By and large Israel accomplished its goal of dividing Lebanon even further. they strengthened Hezbollah further polarizing Lebanon and bringing it closer to civil war.  They didn't really fight very well: can't remember who said this but  "“In 2000 [Nasrallah] did his victory dance in Bint Jbail. He can’t do that this time. His command and control south of Beirut is completely gone. We killed 550 Hezbollah fighters south of the Litani out of an active force of 1250. Nasrallah claimed South Lebanon would be the graveyard of the IDF. But we only lost one tenth of one percent of our soldiers in South Lebanon. The only thing that went according to his plan was their ability to keep firing rockets. If he has enough victories like this one, he’s dead.”  There is nothing wrong with asking for help from Iran and Syria. But the cost is Lebanese sovereignty. Nasrallah outright said that he would like to see Syria in Lebanon again. Reoccupy Lebanon. How many thousands of Lebanese were 'disappeared' by Assads thugs? How many more must be silenced for that pig to have his picture in Beirut again? Those weapons also aren’t being supplied to Lebanon, they are supplied to a single militia within Lebanon which has goals that extend beyond Lebanon’s borders.   In the May conflict revolutionary guards from Iran were captured in Lebanon fighting for Hizbollah. There is a difference between asking for Iran to help Lebanon and asking Iran to kill Lebanese.  Israel would make Damascus a glass crater before Syria acquired a nucke.  I highly doubt the Israelis had any intent on occupying South Lebanon. ISraeli public support would be against it. It could be said Nasrallah took pride in something he had no control over.   Don't try to compare Hizbollah to the IDF, its like a mosquito and an Elephant. The IDF was playing a game with Hizbollah. They have have set a few Merkavas on fire, but they were running out of rockets very quickly. Another month and they would have been out. They were lucky Israel decided to pull back when they did.   Also, nuking Israel would wipe Lebanon off the face of the Earth. everyone in the coutnry would die, so its not in Lebanons interest to see anyone in the middle east have nukes.

Keep playing what you love if you love it.  Noone will tell you to otherwise.  Trends, however, are indicative of what other people are doing, and there probably is a good reason as to why they are doing just that.  If you search for 'RPG', the trends look more reasonable by the way.

I have just as much problem with Islam as I do with Christianity, but on Reddit more stories about Christianity tend to become popular.  I would guess it's because most of the people here are from the US, but that's pure conjecture.  Nonetheless, I comment on Islam just as readily as Christianity, I just don't get the chance as often.
I don't have a subscription so I can't read the whole article but there has still been no justificiation for this 1 in 4000 figure.  From what I'm reading Im guessing that since they estimate that millions of people have been exposed to the prion (evidence?) and knowing what they do of prevelance of the genes they were studying that thats how they came to their conclusion.
People have started doing a lot of things in the name of "atheism", but **atheism isn't a movement or a group**, it's simply people who don't believe in theism. Being an atheist doesn't automatically mean you are anti-religious.  I don't think it is a good idea to give religious people the idea that anti-religion and atheism are one in the same. If you want to take down religion, all power to you, but call yourself what you are, anti-religious. Or call yourself an anti-religious person who happens to be an atheist.

XP will get security updates until 2015 (probably).  XP didnt magically stop working when Vista ships. Why wouldnt you want to take advantage of the hardware you buy?  To say that GNU/Linux is "modern" in the same sense (in terms of features, capability and experience) of Vista (or XP for that matter) is dishonest. I've been using GNU/Linux professionally and personally since RH5.  As a replacement for small apps on UNIX in the server room on x86 hardware?  Yes.  Would I run linux in place of AIX or HPUX for Oracle or DB2?  No.  As a LAMP server?  Perhaps.  In an enterprise?  Doubtful. As a desktop?  No.

Around here, the pawn shops have price tags that are _higher than retail_ on used items.  How does a buyer politely tell the pawn shop that their prices are crazy?  What is a good way to negotiate a price?  Let's play a game.  We have a hammer that cost $20, new.  The pawn shop price tag is $25 for the hammer, used.  I want to pay $5 to $7.50.  How should this conversation go?

&gt; Is that a problem?  Only if you're claiming you're utterly uninterested in atheism.  Also, you'll note that my original statement was this:  &gt; many atheists define themselves  You may very well be in the minority which doesn't. You've got an excellent sample size of *one*, but despite that, I'm going to have to avoid accepting your conclusion for right now.  &gt; The flaw I see is in your assumption that individuals belong in a group for the sole reason that they agree about something.  Try again. That's not what I'm claiming. Read the words I actually wrote, rather than the things flitting through your mind.  Here's a couple hints:  &gt; define themselves by  and  &gt; issue, idea, or cause  Those are distinct in important ways from "people gathering" and "dances, music, food and fun".

Drag racing is a big problem in this area, and the courts impose especially severe sentences for people who are caught drag racing. A friend of mine who would walk his dog at night repeatedly saw two cops drag race each other at high speeds in his residential neighborhood. He called the police station, and the sergeant came out the next night and witnessed it. He said they were just young kids, and he would have a word with them. Had they not been cops, surely half the police force would be there busting them.

It's just the other end of the social spectrum. Some people can associate with them and not be affected, for others it leads to an unrealistic view of human interaction. This applies to both geeks and jocks.

Back in college I worked at a grocery store, and one day I had a customer request that I help her pack her groceries in her car. Once we got out there, she pulled out her keyless entry fob and tried to unlock the car, but nothing happened.   She tried again a few times, but still no luck. Finally, she asked me if she could go inside to call a locksmith to come unlock her car for her.   Of course I told her to just use the key.  You'd be surprised at the level of idiocy some people have when it comes to things like this. We just aren't trained to problem solve any more. I think this is part of the reason that most of my really good friends just happen to work as STE's...
But think of where Catholicism was a couple hundred years ago.  It used to be that getting anywhere politically essentially required church blessing, which often meant some grey-area deals with the clergy.  The Medici family got their children into high positions in the church via their wealth and influence and used their new church connections to get even more power.   In many areas people were convinced that donations could reconcile their sins and the sins of their dead, and the money was used to facilitate increasing the range of the ministry. Excommunications were essentially the end for most people.  In a lot of ways Scientology parallels peak Catholicism.  The Scientology is in some ways becoming "necessary" or at least advisable for career advancement in the entertainment industry.  People are made to pay to level up at the threat of continued unhappiness.  Today scientologists who leave or are forced out of the church often get massive publicity campaigns waged against them to ruin their public image.  It's basically the same deal in a lot of ways.  Someday Clearwater, Fl will gain sovereignty and in a couple hundred years Scientology could well be hanging out fighting the good fight against Xenu without anyone seeing what's wrong with it.

Food production is not exactly about "observing animals" or "providing a decent life and painless death for an animal".  This is what modern food production is:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkuohLV2u0k#t=2m43s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yrxo0C__QxY#t=0m36s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL4wE84JZL4  Look at the size of those chickens. They are about the size of your fist. That's because chickens are killed for food when they are 6 weeks old, not yet adults, and long before they've been able to have a "decent life."

If this is the guy that inserted the one line "this unlikely democracy" adding maybe only that one one word "unlikely", then he is my hero. That one word caught me in that speech and I'll never forget it. If he is the guy that wrote that "we are the ones we have been waiting for" then he has a very secure future as a writer. That was gold. I know I have the quotes a little wrong but it't too late for me to look up the exact words. That is part of it though, you don't have to remember the exact words, just the feeling they brought to you.
To be fair that $2.5T figure was for a ten year period, which went back into GHWBs term up to 01. $250B per year on dark programs, but you can guarantee quite a few percent got skimmed off due to lack of oversight or Congressional openness on contracts.

No. I'm not confusing the words "disease" and "infection." The words "non living protein" in the title infers that "living proteins" exist.
I do not believe in God, nor do I eat meat. The two, in my opinion, do not correlate in any way at all.  I simply chose to be vegetarian because I was tired of my constant pains (every time I move it feels like someone slammed all the joints and bones in my body with a sledgehammer), disgusting chemicals that make their way into my food, and I eventually found meat to be very unpleasant.  I used to watch my grandparents' neighbors kill their chicken. Let's just say that after the friendly lady yanked out the warm vocal chords from a previously-cute-and-breathing chicken, meat became a little weird to me. She showed me you can produce clucking sounds by pressing on a certain area, though!
Not really.  I wasted a ton of time doing nothing, when I should have been studying for a final on Greek and Roman Mythology (which is going to be insanely harder than it should be).  I took the class, because I'm genuinely interested in the topic (I read the Illiad in 7th grade), but it's been so boring my love for it has been slowly killed.  Although in all my procrastinating, I did manage to catch up on a bit of reading for myself, which I haven't really had the chance to do in a while, so I guess that was nice.

Well what if your sitting on the sidewalk one day with a disassembled ar-15 and then your spidy sense starts tingling. You look down the road and you see a big black truck coming towards you at a grueling slow pace. You reassemble your ar-15 just in time to see it's a swat truck and just as you cock back the bolt they see you and in self defense they swerve to hit you. You get off 5 rounds into the driver as you roll out of the way and take headshots on the remaining swat members.  Later in court they pull out a cctv tape showing that they swerved at you before you pointed ur rifle at them. You are freed of all charges and then you sue the SWAT department for emotional distress and become a millionaire.

Statistics show that most sexually active people will contract some form of sexually transmitted HPV in their lifetime. At any given point in time, 1% of the sexually active population is said to be infected with genital warts. There are several types of HPV which can affect the genitals, and only a few of them can lead to cancer, but each year, cervical cancer kills more than 200,000 women worldwide, with about three fourths of these cases stemming from venereal HPV which developed into cancer. It is not opinion but objective truth that the HPV vaccine is an excellent discovery. There has been some unfortunate controversy over the vaccine, but there should not be. Everybody should know about the HPV vaccine.

No opinions only experience here  Have worked on a speech synthesizer, an IP-PBX, and an analysis tool for petroleum engineers.  All were written in "using minimal C subset of C++". Difficult to trace memory leaks, spaghetti code, unclear logic, very difficult to correct bugs and/or add features were the norm.  Moved to full featured C++, STL and BOOST against almost all developers' wishes (most prevalent excuse was "C++ is too complex").  Memory leaks went away, code became much concise, logic became more clear, bugs were easily removed and features were easily added. And 2 of the 3 were cross-platform on Linux and Windows (we also made a Solaris release of the TTS for one customer)  For me, refusing to work with C++ has only the following reasons: -  * *Extreme* space constraints (we ran into this on symbian)  * Non-availability of a good C++ compiler (VC6 gave us a lot of headaches)  * Ignorance or Prejudice (Hazy idea of STL capabilities, ignorance of BOOST)  As for system level programming, I suppose BeOS was C++ and I have only heard praises about its capability and design.

Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die.  [Deut 13:6](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/dt/13.html#6)

Out of curiosity, do you know where this beef flavor comes from?  My guess would be that it's actually beef-derived, which kind of defeats the point.  I could be wrong on this, though.  Maybe there's a reasonable fake beef flavor on the market.  I'd still rather just have my beef, though.  I don't see anything natural or "more moral" about vegetarianism.  I believe animals are resources, and we can and should use them.

"individual action on behalf on the group."  They don't act individually. Preachers talk politics from the pulpit (evangelicals elected Bush twice). The Moron Church pumped 25 million into prop 8 in CA. The scientologists brainwash their followers to the point they go crazy with a sword. The fundamentalist Muslims encourage Jihad. I think one of the things that creates animosity towards religion is every religious person says "That these actions cannot be blamed on the individual worshipers, but it is the worshipers fault, they support the power structures that take these actions.   That doesn't mean you can't practice what you want to practice, but don't be fooled. If you are a catholic and you put money in the collection plate you helped those priests get away with child molestation, if you were a part of ted haggarts church you supported both his meth habit and his love of male prostitution, if you gave to the mosque you've helped suicide bombers, if you've given money to the synagogue you've helped suppress the Palestinians. How does the saying go......an avalanche is caused by a single snow flake.  "were atheism as widely held and believed, similar actions would be committed in it's name."   Most of Europe is agnostic and atheist, some countries like finland are almost completely atheist. Will I'm sure the possibility is there it hasn't played out.  "You make a good point and I concede that the point is yours."  The important thing is not that you concede my point, I'm not trying to win a contest, but you fit it into your line of thinking and help propagate the meme.  Most Atheists have no problem with religious people and their practices as long as they don't try to make their beliefs other peoples reality. Unfortunately the way the human mind works it compels them to try (which they excuse as spreading the word of god).

I never said that things don't need to change. But the bad conditions now don't mean vegetarianism is better in the long run. There can be a situation where farms are not horrid places. I realize food production isn't about observing animals, but it does provide that effect. Providing a decent life and painless death is also possible under human supervision. Just because things need to change doesn't mean they need to change 180º.
Have you?
huh?  1346 songs where?  I'm up to 8,715 Radiohead songs 'scobbled' on last.fm since mid-2005 and I'm not even the biggest fan amongst my friends.
I think they should make an Anonymous versus Scientology and Mormons video game.
The judge isn't above the law, she can't hold someone in contempt for following her religion, especially when it is something which doesn't actually affect anyone like wearing a Hijab.  In this case especially, she was told she couldn't enter the court room with the Hijab, she got mad and said an expletive then turned to leave, it was at this point she was arrested and taken into court where the judge decided she shouldn't be wearing a Hijab in court.  The events occured in Georgia so I'd say there was some hate involved on the part of the judge. If it was a nun or a evangelical christian woman I doubt the judge would have 'ordered' her to take her Hijab off.

Doubt it - sounds like just "easy" and more than willing to suppress any residual pride and allow herself to be the "hole &amp; a heartbeat" of last resort at parties just to gain at least some sort of attention.  Once the guys sobered up.... their friends would give them a little shit... only a little though since they ALL had probably already hit it....
Sorry to hear you had to deal with that. I grew up in a similar financial situation and today I have tons of problems with my gums, jaw and teeth. Many of the problems I have are actually quite painful and it goes back to my Mother not getting me proper dental care as a child. There are times when I have pain from chewing because my jaw is so out of alignment. A problem braces could have fixed.  What else sucks about it is so many dentists today are younger or came from wealthier backgrounds which afforded them the opportunity to become a dentist. As a result they have no bedside manner/sympathy for many people who couldn't afford dental care throughout their childhood. My insurance was downgraded last year (*when is it ever upgraded?*) and I had to go to a new provider after having worked with a local dentist for quite some time with the anticipation of getting braces along with some other work after finishing up *back work*. My new provider absolutely sucked. I was waiting in the chair and I heard the dentist, whom I had yet to meet, out in the hallway and she was reviewing my charts and I heard her say "is this guy actually serious about his teeth?". It was a shitty blanket statement on her part that because my teeth are crooked and I have gum problems that I never brush, floss or rinse. She was basically a bitch. She came in with a big sigh and acted as if I was really putting her out by trying to improve my dental health.   I later looked up at the wall and noticed her degree. It was Harvard Dental... I first thought "Wow, how lucky am I that a real Harvard educated dentist works at this clinic my shitty insurance pays for!" Seconds later I thought "but what a fucking inconsiderate bitch... I wish I could grow up and go to one of the best schools in the world so I could pass judgment on others too".   Just looking up now and I can't believe how much I wrote on this shit, if you haven't guessed yet having problems with your teeth really sucks and I'm still pissed about it.

&gt;However, earlier in the week, Senator Conroy pointed out the issue of access to Telstra's network had already been ruled on by the courts.  &gt;"In fact, Telstra decided to take this matter all the way to the High Court,'' Senator Conroy said on Monday.  &gt;The High Court rejected Telstra's claim.  &gt;"Even (chief justice) Michael Kirby joined the other six members to say that when Telstra purchased the network, they purchased it with an access regime in place. Get used to it,'' Senator Conroy said.    Hey, Senator Conroy said something and it wasn't totally retarded.   Sol Trujillo is playing the same failing game he's been running since taking the helm at Telstra - playing hardball with the government and with the regulators, talking big to the media, screwing it up where it counts (how could the government have accepted their shameful NBN faux-proposal?), and driving the share price into the ground.  The best thing he can do for Telstra is to step down - without taking a golden parachute.
Its really more of a symbolic gesture on Russias own behalf. They want to strengthen their position in the middle east and arms dealing is one of the best ways for them to do so.

Um no. For the most part, I don't think of religion, much like I don't think of sprites or leprachauns (unless I want to feel a little jumpy).   As for what we can discuss in a group that's named Atheism? How about the wonders of nature? How about ways of bringing people together instead of dividing us further? How about exploring how/why/what we think is moral? There's so much more as well. Are you this preoccupied with Santa? No? Then why concern yourself so much with religion?
what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

It is not an "Atheist sign", it is a sign made by some anti-religion group. Atheists aren't a group, coven, fellowship, or movement. Atheism is the opposite of theism and nothing more. Just because I don't believe in religion doesn't automatically make me anti-religious (although I am).  Call it for what it is, Freedom from Religion sign stolen, not "Atheist sign stolen". I am an atheist, and I had no part in making the sign.  We don't want to send a message to people were trying to save from religion, making them think they are leaving one batshit crazy group for another.
Pat Tillman is not one of America's greatest heroes, but giving up a lucrative career in anything to serve your country when you feel it needs you is very honorable. If more people felt a greater responsibility to their country instead of their wallet we would all live in a far better world.
Amen.  Between Secret Chiefs 3, Fantomas, Trio Convulsant, Tomahawk and whatever else, there's no denying the members of Mr Bungle are still creative.

There is always a parking spot right in front of wherever the actors are going.  In almost all movies, someone will eventually say "let's get out of here."

Just today? ... or was that a figure of speech thing, and it was recently in Florida?  I know that the, "hey, I was in a smoke filled store" meme exists, but a friend who works at a Volusia County, FL store seriously had a fire this week where managers went back in the building for some dumb-ass reason. "The fire was way in the back" blah, blah.
My brother is a surgeon and passed me this link. He's actually operated on a perforated bowel because of water pressure. He says there's no question she was SITTING on the fountain spigot and it went off. If you're standing, even wide stance, your body itself will tend to hold the orifaces closed. Sitting, not only are you closer, but you are also stretching both your holes open.  Still a terrible accident, but the girl was also being awfully  stupid. It wasn't "dancing through a fountain stream", it was sitting on top of a high pressure hose, waiting for it to erupt.
This is what women do, she keeps calling and hanging out, so she can fuck other guys, but try to lead you on, so you wont go off and date any girls seriously. Its part of the plan  So cut off all communication, tell her you have decided that being friends is for pussys and go out and start tapping some ass

To ward off a _slightly_ higher risk of a terrorist attack? No.  However, if hypothetically you know there's a nuclear bomb with a timer ticking somewhere in Manhattan and you have someone in captivity who knows where it is and how to defuse it, then... well, maybe. The thing is that this scenario (called the [ticking time bomb scenario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticking_time_bomb_scenario)) is logistically never going to actually happen, except maybe if the attacker is an intelligent schizophrenic sociopath. As we have seen, once the government accepts that it would torture in *any* situation, it realizes that it can torture people more effectively with research, and develops "enhanced interrogation" techniques, as the euphemism goes. That is not acceptable.

It really depends on what you consider torture to be.   In some countries torture involves being beaten to death, having your wife or children raped or tortured in front of you, pliers, car batteries, acid, machetes, or worse.  The crying out against water boarding is very disproportional to the cries against rape and torture happening in Africa right now, or even to the cries against what Saddam did to his own people in Iraq.  Do you think anyone would have thrown shoes at Saddam? Fuck no. 7 years in prison for assaulting Saddam would have not even been thought of by any judge. Torture followed by death of the perp and his entire family would have been most likely. If anything the shoe chucking incident is an incredible demonstration of the radical changes occurring in Iraq.  Anyways, as I mentioned above, the disparity between the outcries over real human rights violations and the half-assed ones in Guantanamo Bay prove the outrage over Guantanamo to be nothing more than partisan politicking by the left to push their agendas. And if that doesn't convince you, wait until all of the crying stops as soon as Obama decides to keep Guantanamo open and the torturers a' torturin'.
You may say that now, but I'll be laughing in your face after the apocalypse when you come to me begging for more soap and toilet paper because your house was too small to store it.  If you prefer though you could just get an underground bunker. That would work too, plus you'd be safe from smaller nuclear bombs.

Lieberman should face a guillotine for treason.
Because, as I've said in other threads, Obama himself has said that he wants us to push him. He needs to know there's a constituency behind him so that he's not using up political capital for nothing.  Yes, going to change.org is fine. But what's much better is having the issue and scientific evidence on the national news.  Use the media as it uses us. That's how you get change.
'Cause that's where the bacon was?
Okay, Don't double the bass like that, you're getting a cross-harmonic distortion from the two tracks that is creating a messy sound. Use the compressed bass, but make sure it has a tight attack, play with the release, but try to keep it relatively short. I wouldn't go over about a 1.5 ratio, because you want to keep the dynamics in there. Also, try to play a little more with the stereo image and placement of your sounds. Keep the bass anchored in the middle, spread some of your vocals, (which sound great btw) even feel free to pan the snare a little just to break up the solidness of the sound. Your reverb is creating this HUGE space but everything is sitting flat in the middle.   I don't know what to say about the iPod headphones. Frankly I'm shocked that it sounds as good as it does having been mixed down on earbuds. You need something that will accurately represent your bass. That's why I think its problematic. Listen to the song in the car, on your sister's boom-box, through the tv on a dvd player and take notes, then try to adjust based on an average of what you heard.   It's terribly hard to mix without a solid reference. At least invest in a great pair of studio headphones with good range response. Sennheiser makes some excellent headphones that are under $100. I think they would be well worth the investment.

I'd take this guy more seriously if he didn't seem like he wanted to keep the South barefoot and pregnant. Apparently the South can't have industry of its own unless it's "poaching" from the North, "collaborating" and "conniving" to "wipe out" industry and "destroy" jobs.

How can you not denounce Operation Northwoods? The fact that it was drawn up only confirms the U.S. military and gov't would use false-flag attacks.

The therapist idea sounds good if only because it would hopefully generate more understanding by your father and not be construed as some kind of exercise in "fixing" you.  &gt; Anyway, it actually went well. My dad didn't go ape-shit, he said that I'm his son and if being gay is my choice then that's OK with him.  He sounds accepting enough but the idea that it is even "your choice" still shows some confusion on his part about the matter.  &gt; I know it will take some time for him to get used to it, and even more time accept it but I'm willing to wait.  It sounds like it has been taking some time for him to soften his stance, so I could see him taking some time to get used to it or accept it.  But it would be odd if he hasn't been taking some of his time already up to this point to prepare for such a moment, and hadn't been trying to get used to the IDEA of it.

It is dangerous to be an atheist in the age of fundamentalism.  Atheists are **the most hated minority in America**.  People like gays more than atheists, and those people are losing their rights left and right.  Listen to the vitriolic things said about us on mainstream news and you'll see just how "ok" it is to hate on atheists.  So why don't you get over yourself?

This was a big deal and exciting when the PS3 was new two years ago. But currently the best HPC bang-for-buck is a cheap PC loaded with 2 or more Nvidia GPUs. One $1000 box will have about 3000 MFlops, and easier programming.  3 Playstation 3's (same $1000) is only about 600 Mflops.

Only putting this here because it's probably relevant: they tested his blood level most likely because of the lawsuit against the state/office/whomever. The party sued might have a full/partial defense to negligence if the party suing was contributorily/comparatively negligent (the idea being that if he was driving drunk he was partially at fault). It's also possible that it's a mandatory state law to test the blood of someone who dies in a car accident for alcohol. Additionally, it's even possible that the family themselves did the test as evidence that he wasn't being negligent in his driving.  Now, I'm still just a law student so I'm not sure if this is the case, and I also don't know how the tort law in this particular state works. But I'm pretty sure I'm right about this or I wouldn't bother posting and risk someone who knows more than me going and correcting me.  And for the record, all you people who are defending cops in part or in whole just don't get it. It is NEVER justifiable to take away any American's rights. They exist for a reason and without fail, when they are removed, there is more harm to that person and to society as a whole than any potential good.   There are a ridiculous number of cases where a person who seemed obviously to be a 'bad guy' was railroaded by aggressive cops only to be found innocent after wasting away in prison. There have been far, far more crimes perpetrated on Americans by the police in this country than by any single other group out there, and this is even more reprehensible given that these men and women are supposed to be our protectors, not our oppressors.   If you feel that some individual cop you may know doesn't fit into this, it's simply because you haven't seen that side of the person, not because it isn't there. The authority and power granted to these individuals, coupled with low pay, high pressure, and little to no accountability, always result in the same corrupt organization - and when am organization is systemically corrupt, it affects everyone within, no matter how hard you may imagine that it does not.

&gt; Only if you're claiming you're utterly uninterested in atheism.  Oh? I'm claiming that I'm utterly uninterested in religion. Why are you trying to turn a religious opinion into a religion?   &gt; many atheists define themselves by... &gt; ... You've got an excellent sample size of *one*  Really? So you are many people? As far as I can tell - you also have a sample size of *one*. I'd like to see *your* data.  See? I can do it to.  &gt; issue, idea, or cause  Last I checked, agreement, by definition requires an idea to be agreed to!  Just because you, I, and many other individuals on /r/atheism *agree* on atheism does not in any way, shape or form mean that we will agree on anything else - kind of defeating the idea that we are a group in any way.
its a good think no one on the internet really tells the truth...
I can totally feel what you've gone through. Personally, I live to make others happy and to make sure my memory will remembered in a positive way. I try to be good and help as many people as I can. If you can do that and it honestly gives you self-satisfaction, then you're sure you will be remembered. As for dying and not knowing you're dead because there will be nothing of you that can remember if you're dead or alive, that's just something you come to terms as you age. It's a sad thought to kick around your head though =(

I'd argue that most of those problems are not actually caused by religion. If all religion was given up everywhere tomorrow, you can be sure that we'd still have suicide bombers, racists, and homophobes. The suicide bombers may say, "This is in the name of the motherland" instead of God or Allah. It makes just as much sense. There are other causes for this kind of  behavior. Homophobes use religion to justify their own prejudices. Without it, they will find doctors and scientists who will agree that homosexuality is a disease or severe mental disorder. All these problems will continue to exist, simply with a new justification.   I will agree with the pedophile priests though. I think that's an example of people being denied a healthy relationship with a consenting adult and a destructive behavior as a result. I do believe that needs to be addressed and reformed, and that an organized religion is encouraging a very negative behavior there.

&gt; as I described elsewhere, the ability to inline functions where C can only pass function pointers Based on your comment further down, I assume you're talking about things like std::sort vs qsort. The problem with this argument, is that you can do exactly the same thing in C with plain macros, it's just a bit more awkward (particularly since you have to use a bunch of line continuation characters if you don't want to stuff your qsort implementation into a single line) and a bit more work (since the provided qsort doesn't work this way you have to roll your own). I definitely see a developer productivity argument here, but not a speed one. Now there are things you can do with C++ template metaprogramming that you can't do with plain C preprocessor macros, because the former is turing complete and the latter is not. How much of an impact this has on the kind of compile time optimizations you can do short of expanding things by hand I'm not sure. The bigger problem I see in comparing C and C++ on the level you propose, is that given a sufficiently large problem a typical C solution and a typical C++ solution because C++ provides abstraction mechanisms that C does not. For instance, RAII makes heap allocation easier and heap allocation tends to be relatively expensive in both C and C++. Similarly, C's lack of abstractions encourages the programmer to be more aware of the costs of everything he does (of course, one could argue that C programmers tend to waste time with pointless micro-optimizations and as a result miss bigger performance wins elsewhere). Anyway, my point is I find the claim that C++ is faster than C rather disingenuous. Clearly for the common C subset, they should have equivalent performance. For the things in C++ that don't have a clear C equivalent (like advanced template metaprogramming, but not simple cases like std::sort), it's unclear to me that any gains made there aren't in practice wiped out by increased use of "expensive" features in sufficiently large programs. That is why I downmodded your comment. Of course, GTK+ makes for a rather compelling argument against using C (at least for GUI toolkits anyway) since they seem to have tried to awkwardly shoehorn an object system on top of C. Whenever I've had the displeasure of working with GTK+, I always got the impression they should have either just used C++ or stuck with a more C friendly design. I find the recent Vala nonsense incredibly amusing.
No.
The thing is, you guys tend to hate on Christians as a whole, when really your wrath should be directed at a small minority of Christians, the fundamentalists/zealots.  There are many Christians out there who practice what they preach, and aren't really deserving of your hate.  If they want to believe in God, that's their choice, just like it's your choice to obsess about [insert whatever here] and as long as they're not assholes about it and try to force their view on us, we should respect that choice.  tl;dr: There are assholes and nice people in every group.  You really just want to direct your ire at the assholes.  Think before you speak.  BTW I am an atheist.  I think they're somewhat crazy believing in God too.
From a business owner's perspective: How much does it cost to buy a successful pawn business?   How much in gross profit does a successful pawn business make in a year?

&gt; Does this look like the ideal state of the world to you?  No, but in comparison to the past I would say we're in a better state. I agree that we have a long ways to go, but I think it's a little uninformed to say that it's any worse than it used to be. The phrasing of your statement made it sound like, to me, that you were implying that this was the case.  &gt;Ever watched House MD?   Even ignoring the fact that, generally speaking, it's a poor idea to cite Television as any sort of reference, even in the context of television this doesn't really make any sense.   House is a MD with many, many years of training in medicine. If pressed, certainly he could point to a reference in a text book which would support his reasoning. I highly doubt you hold a PhD in sociology or history, or anything remotely relevant to this discussion, and thus it would be unwise for any of us to really trust your judgment on this matter without some serious empirical backing, which was mostly what I was getting at.  TLDR: Don't compare yourself to a fictional medical doctor.

The easiest way to get over someone is to get over someone else. Date someone you don't care about, perferably someone who's also on a rebound. Fuck the hell out of each other while screaming your respective ex's names, then drink yourselves into a stupor bitching about how much you miss her/him.  After a few days (seriously), you'll get over your ex. You could even put up a craigslist ad for a rebound fuck buddy if you want.

Here we go again in the unjust land of the double standard:  In an Islamic state, Christians and Jews can keep their religion but they must pay a sum of money, the Jizyah.   "The purpose of the Jizyah is to humiliate and punish Infidels to encourage them to accept Islam."   The other Infidels (Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, etc.) have no options but to accept Islam or “be killed". .  If this isn't inciting to hatred and violence against specific groups...then I really don't know what is.   Why should there be different standards of conduct for Canadians of different backgrounds and beliefs?

&gt;Actions needed to escape from a car in path of train: unbuckle seatbelt -&gt; unlock car door if it's locked -&gt; open car door -&gt; get off the car -&gt; get off the track  SO by not wearing a seatbelt one can escape from the car quicker, thereby increasing survival chances?  That's great news, I hate being fined for not wearing a seatbelt.
Let's compare:  &gt; I do not think about it, care about it, or give a flying fuck about (a)theism unless someone asks my opinion on it.  vs.  &gt; I'm claiming that I'm utterly uninterested in religion.  Yeah. Uh huh. Nice try.  &gt; agreement, by definition requires an idea to be agreed to!  Where do I claim agreement is the standard? I say *coming together around* an issue, idea, or cause. So yes, you're right, but you're also building a straw man: agreement is necessary, but that doesn't mean there's a group. But I'm *not claiming* it means there's a group.  So again: What's your definition for a group?
I don't think that trying to escape everything yourself is a real solution at all.  You're going to miss something and get burned eventually.

When I came back to the UK to visit last year, for the first time in five years, I was truly amazed by how large everyone was.  Both the percentage and the scale.  It really is a noticeable and disturbing change for someone who hasn't been present throughout.  It was even more noticeable this year when I went back again. Wherever the US leadeth, the UK will surely follow (given enough time and advertising).  Without a shadow of a doubt it's a result of the policies of supermarkets and restaurants.

Koan time:  Nansen saw the monks of the eastern and western halls fighting over a cat. He seized the cat and told the monks: `If any of you say a good word, you can save the cat.' No one answered.

Nansen said: `If you had been there, you could have saved the cat.'  http://www.ibiblio.org/zen/gateless-gate/14.html

To those voting this story up you need to remember one thing.. Hating people who make more money than you or are more successful will not make your own life one iota better. In fact you are doing more harm than good as hatred is self punishment.

I'm not an atheist because of suffering. I don't reject religion because of the perceived harm it does. I reject it on an intellectual level, not an emotional one. I reject it because I don't like to believe in things I have no good reason to believe in. I want my *beliefs* to be as true as possible, so I have to rely on evidence to do such.  I don't see the connection between vegetarianism and atheism when one rejects religion on an intellectual level.

&gt; chickens for food production are killed while still baby chicks (6 weeks old)  This is simply not true.  There's some debate about how old most chicken are at slaughter (some sources claim 6 weeks, other claim 7 to 13).  Regardless, the average chicken sold at the grocery store is most definitely not a "baby chick".  Pick up a chicken at the grocery store and ask yourself if the size and weight corresponds with that of a "chick".  The claim that most chickens are babies at slaughter is a sensationalist claim (oh no, babies!) that doesn't pass even a basic sanity check.  I think there are some valid criticisms of factory farming, but I see no reason that the chickens' ages is especially relevant.  I don't care if my chicken is 6 weeks old or 6 years, except that I want it to be tasty and tender.  The younger chicken will be more of both, and frankly a lot less wasteful.  How many 6 week old chickens can be raised on the amount of food necessary to raise a 6 year old chicken?

&gt;Unless you count downmods as losing and upmods as winning, which I hope makes you pause and wonder if you are sensitive to what other people think). I don't intend to walk away the "winner". Actually, this mental model of winner-loser is what I'm debating. There is an alternative, and that is to remember the golden rule.  I would be a sad fellow indeed if I placed much stock in the vagaries of Reddit's up and down-mods.  The Reddit mob, like any other, is predictable, ignorant, easily manipulated and basically stupid.  Given that, its opinions of my comments as reflected in up or down-mods are, to me, meaningless.  That said, I agree with your sense of what a conversation ought to be; an equable interchange of reasoned ideas wherein both participants emerge the richer in knowledge and reflection, as opposed to Dr. Johnson's depiction of a conversation as a contest in which the individual "of greater parts" must necessarily emerge the victor. We need say no more on the subject.  As for martial arts, specifically in their sense as a set of physical and mental disciplines and/or systems, I would argue that almost across the board and with very few exceptions, they have had a far greater net benefit to humanity than they have had cost. In virtually all martial arts systems I know of, it is emphatically the case that the training necessarily teaches respect and humility.  It has further been my experience that it is almost impossible to attain any degree of proficiency in any martial arts system without also absorbing a deep disinclination to ever actually use it on a fellow human being who is not similarly trained. My own training background mixes Aikido (a passive form of Ju-Jitsu) with Okinawan Karate, a little Choy-Li-Fut Kung Fu, and predominantly, Muay Thai, which is what I now train on a regular day-to-day basis.  While Muay Thai is perhaps one of the most potentially brutal and effective stand-up martial arts there is, it is worth noting that in order to learn it, one must learn humility, respect and a great degree of self-discipline, for without those qualities, one will never be accepted as a student to a legitimate teacher.  Not only that, while Muay Thai *can* be incredibly brutal, Thailand is a Buddhist country which means that the practice of Muay Thai as a traditional discipline or system borrows heavily from Buddhist precepts.  In Muay Thai, for example, a trained individual is allowed to use his or her skills only in a very limited set of circumstances.  One may use Muay Thai for self defense, for the defense of others who cannot defend themselves, and in sportsmanlike competition with other trained athletes.  On the other hand, one may never use Muay Thai in defense of pride or by way of redress of an insult, and it has always been my experience that the people who bother to really learn Muay Thai are the same people who have the strength of character and basic respect for all living beings such that ego-based aggression would never even occur to them. In the case of professional mixed martial arts what we have is a pool of highly-trained athletes who wish to make a living by vetting their skills against similarly-trained opposition.  No one is coerced into fighting when they don't wish to --they would not be successful if they didn't mean it-- and it has been my universal experience that the level of mutual respect found in MMA far exceeds that of any other sport. I've never fought professionally, but I do know that every time I've bested a guy in sparring, I've felt bad about it, not because he got roughed up, but rather, because whatever he was doing, all the hard work he'd put into it, didn't work. And I respect that, and that's the difference between human martial artists and dogs. Does a fighting dog have a sense of respect for his or her opponent? Maybe, in some sense.  What I know for a fact is that fighting dogs don't have the benefit of three thousand years of respectful martial arts, and that to compare the two is fucking disrespectful to a great human endeavor. The guy who broke his leg --and I don't really know anything about him-- was by all accounts not equipped to fight at the level he was in, and if you want to argue that a system that allows an under-qualified guy to fight at that level is fundamentally flawed, I'll give you that. Point is, it's that particular system and not the practice of martial arts in general that is flawed.  You must understand the difference.        
Most of these laptops are manufactured by Clevo. They get re-branded as dell, alienware, Ibuypower, cyberpower. Just find an outlet that doesn't force you to put an OS on it. Linux is fucking easy to use. With wine you can get just about anything running in linux. I put linux on several peoples computers and I haven't had to remove one piece of spyware or malware. Even if linux got a virus it wouldn't be able to run when you restarted the computer and you'd have to configure the damn virus anyways.
What a stupid initialism.  Writing the initialism "ETA:" in capital letters requires that you hit 5 key strokes, and writing the word "edit:" requires that you hit 6 keystrokes.
That's pretty sweet. I might have to buy one.
Evolution of Search. Doesn't that imply there was no intelligent design involved?  Oh that's right, there wasn't.

Probably talking past each other, but Linus' comment was about boost and STL being bad for portability and stability. I have more experience with Boost so that's what I focused on. My point still stands about complicated libraries - have you used STL on numerous platforms? Old HP-UX? Ancient Irix. Something like an SCM system should be able to run on all systems - otherwise it isn't so interesting.

Finally a semi-edgy pirate joke.
