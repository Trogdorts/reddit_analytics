New lesson learned:  stuffing a moist citrus skin with rolled oolong results in the oolong puffing up during the heating process (presumably mostly from the steam from the peel relaxing the tight roll of the oolong nugget).  Add to that the rind shrinking during baking.  We now have a half-dozen "Jiffy Pop" oranges with the oolong exploding from the top.  Time to remove the extra tea and put the tops back on!

Dawggg your hood rat filth yo.  Your opinion mean nothing PERIODT   Figured I'd translate so you understand better because the previous simple concepts were so complex to you that you had to strawman rather than comprehending and engaging in an intelligent discussion...
&gt; The deck isn‚Äôt different in any significantly meaningful way   Yes it is, because the players have an expectation of the Deck being genuinely random, if you take that away they are the same. The point is they aren't. I don't understand why you don't get this.   DOMT has baggage with it, that it is a certain thing (genuinely, possibly game breaking), a Hoard is just 'a bunch of money and magic items' not, 'i may end the world'
Who tf came up with that
If they were with his gym stuff he‚Äôs probably taking them for testosterone/other supplements. But also you may not know if he had an erection problem, especially if he were taking pills for it. Not something a lot of young guys want to bring up with their partner due to it being embarrassing, think if you couldn‚Äôt naturally get wet enough to have safe sex and lube wasn‚Äôt really a thing lol. Could lead to you feeling like ‚Äúless of a women‚Äù or like you couldn‚Äôt give him what he wants, but even moreso for men because so much of our masculinity is tied to genital size, sexual performance, etc.

In the beginning sheep didn‚Äôt have that problem. They just grew enough wool to be cozy and not die of hypothermia.  Then humans noticed their wool was good to make clothes and started breeding and shaving them.  The ones that grew wool the slowest started dying of hypothermia and/or humans wouldn‚Äôt let them breed.  Fast forward a couple thousand years and sheep need to keep producing wool the entire year so that they don‚Äôt die of hypothermia and/or get killed by humans

You could be against severe lockdowns and still believe that cramming 200 people in a crowded room in the middle of a pandemic is a poor choice. It‚Äôs not a binary thing.

Never mind knock-off clones -- what if someone deliberately created a tainted vaccine?  It would erode trust in the real thing, and we'd be back at square one, if not a whole lot worse off.

I‚Äôm speaking from a draft perspective. Comparing Trask to Brady is a stretch but let‚Äôs go with that since that was the comp you brought up. Trask could be Brady in the perfect system, but Brady was a sixth round pick. Trask could end up being a really good NFL QB, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a first round pick.   You bring up Mac, I assume because you see I‚Äôm a bama fan, but I also don‚Äôt think Mac is a first round guy. I think Mac and Trask both have elements of their game that keeps them from being elite draft prospects. Does that mean they won‚Äôt succeed in the NFL? Of course not. They just aren‚Äôt first found prospects.
Thanks for the help! My biggest fear is not getting any at all so knowing that I'm still probably eligible for even a little is a big relief.

&gt; people simply do not want to be part of society.  There are programs that can help people want to be part of a society and work towards it.  People can change with outside intervention. It happens to us all the time. If cults can exist, I don't see why you think people can't be convinced to not go to prison.
You nailed it. The biggest mistake you can make when the mob comes for you, is to give them what they want. If you let them howl for a while, they‚Äôll eventually wander off to ruin someone else‚Äôs life.

Honestly, Stranger's Wrath is a fine game by itself, but holy shit how could they not even bother to change the "for PlayStation 3" bit?  I'm pretty sure you guys aren't strapped for cash enough just to recycle the PS3 box. Or at least slap a sticker on and call it a day.

Excactly four long years ago. In january 2018 reddit was making memes about tidepods, in january 2019 reddit was making memes about airpods. Then a wise redditor made a prophecy, in jan 2020 firepods would become a meme, and in jan 2020 earthpods would become a meme and then the world would be saved. In jan 2020 firepods became a meme. But... a very dumb redditor tried to rush the prophecy, he made a meme about earthpods in jan 2020. Every since then the world has been terrible as a punishment. But now, we have reached jan 2021 and earthpods shall become a meme and save the world. LONG LIVE THE PROPHECY!!

Exactly! It tastes metallic as shit and it's disgusting. I also don't care about juice usage. My local vape shop makes tons of my 50mg nic salt and I buy 2 bottles at a time which lasts me about 6-8 weeks. I am still using my OG caliburn and I think I always will until I can't get any more coils.
I actually love the smell and the satisfying crunch when I'm cutting onions, but I also love not crying off all of my mascara LMFAO.
Gonna flame a chick for her pink tape? Or is it for the shitty tape job bc that would be fair tbh

It‚Äôs always been pretty clear to me that people who say things like this‚Äîincluding pointing out when a silence is awkward, thus doubling the awkwardness‚Äîaren‚Äôt looking for any kind of response. They‚Äôre not thinking about the response at all. They‚Äôre just trying to soothe the anxiety they feel.  Which basically makes them the same as the quiet or shy person.
Thank you :)

My MRI story (Texas USA)..I had to get an MRI, and my Dr. referred me to the hospital,,was going to be 2500 for an MRI. I knew that imaging places could do for less, so I called one, and it was 800 with insurance, or 400 without. I asked why, and they said that was how they billed. So I called my insurance(Blue Cross) and asked if I paid cash, would they take it off of my deductable...They said no! So, I just applied the insurance, paid 800, which cost Blue Cross 400 bucks. I did it this way, because I had a surgury, which was gonna chew all of my deductable anyways. Bizarre , stupid, American health care.
So you didn‚Äôt read, but chose to comment anyway with a complete strawman argument. Okay.
Happy New Year!!

They‚Äôre not buying as much assets as they were earlier in the year. Some of their asset-buying programs expire today. Basically, fhe money printer is being taken away. Since QE usually results in stocks going up, it‚Äôs not the best news to you and I. However, there‚Äôll be a new Treasury Secretary soon, so those programs will probably come back.

Which is interesting because Mickey is the only OG Disney character to ever visibly wield a Keyblade too. Yen Sid was said to be a former master but we never see him wield one.

The XRK ChainSAW stock reduces your Sprint to Fire time by 125ms and the Tactical Sprint to Fire time by like 187ms. This gives you a sprint to fire of 200ms which granted is slower than most SMGs (MP5 and Fennec are 117 and Mac-10 is 163), is still ridiculously fast for any AR or LMG

I have no knowledge of the market so take my questions/comments with a huge grain of salt but if you heart is set on a new build, it looks like the area has a couple of new builds around. Have you considered them? Granted they look fairly expensive to my Northeast eyes but not as expensive as this project is proposing to be.
I'm looking to expand my tool collection but funds are limited so I want to make an informed decision: Which would be better for flattening surfaces, handheld electric planers or a handheld belt sander? I already have an orbital sander (first sander purchased).

The ones with the compressors inside are great until it gets really cold.  The ends freeze up often as I doubt anybody drains the water from the tank.  In a pinch I've thrown the end in the exhaust pipe of my running car.  Got it working, but probably screwed the next guy as it refroze.
Generally a ‚ÄúI have to discuss this with my family first‚Äù is absolutely understood and acceptable. No company is gonna be upset about that
Kkkkk caralho fico impressionado com o n√≠vel dos novos autista cancervadores nesse sub.  N√£o, senhor Zezin, ser de direita √© ser cavaleiro templ√°rio defensor da moral e dos bons costumes, qualquer coisa q n seja isso √© inven√ß√£o de esquerdista.   Teocracia √°rabe absolutista capitalista? Esquerda.  R√∫ssia regida pela igreja romana ortodoxa e capitalista olig√°rquica? Esquerda.  Etnocracia judaica israelita capitalista? Literalmente comunistas.
You‚Äôre an idiot.
Very true.  My cousin was morbidly obese and was in constant misery due to all the joint pain.
For sure, there's no guarantee.  But a big part of the switch version's popularity came from smash dlc rumors so I imagine a lot of the sales are coming from bigtime Nintendo fans.  In addition, Koei's been good about doing periodic reprints for Ryza that go for $40 because it's their best-selling Atelier game.  You're right though, if someone is interested in Ryza it's still a good deal to get it now, but if it's a lower priority for another there's a good chance you could get it for cheaper relatively soon.
these aren‚Äôt even funny anymore this is just sad
Nope. Just checked and it starts during the song.

You'll end the season with full tet boss gear equivalent, tet weapons and full tri acessories. You make the math. It'd take quite a while to reach that just on your own outside of season. But with seasonal you can probably reach where you are now within a day.

Great post, I'm ready to get down voted, lol.

I mean mythic rarity is about 1 in 8 chance to get it. I've pulled a few, just have to buy enough boosters, know what I mean?
I thought it was Garver, too.

Call and let the hairstylist know that sister tested positive recently and knowingly went there for an appointment. This lets them know to get tested and possibly prevent further spread and also that your sister is a shit customer and maybe they should drop her as a client and/or more.

You can basically get a decent game for free though right now on sale.  Too bad you can't give the code away, I'd use it if I were in your shoes.
how isn‚Äôt it healthy? i‚Äôm still a whole and healthy person, i have my own hobbies and interests and time to myself. but he‚Äôs still genuinely my favorite person to hang out with. he‚Äôs just fun and energetic and i don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs unhealthy to enjoy spending time with your child lol. i have adult friends who i do try and see semi-often and talk to during the week, but they still aren‚Äôt as fun as my son ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Totally agree that the first are the hardest to get - 3 months to hit 1k, 2 months to hit 2k and then 1 week to get to 3.5k.
Just gonna leave out the part where Trump is doing this too
Yesss my man
Upvote üòâ
Yah he was caught off guard. Like with the scabbards. He did not expect them to be able to hurt him. you see what happened when he got serious afterwards.
So you have an HP Pavilion Gaming Desktop? Get some new 3200 Ram Sticks for dual channeling, 16 GBs don't cost much right now, maybe a 2GB 1030 or 1050 TI Asus Phoenix if it fits in your case. And you might wanna upgrade that power supply, definitely, there's a new platinum power supply being sold by Fractal Design for pretty cheap.
the desktop picture is a german Tiger. i was memeimg
Hope it turns out to be a good experience. Enjoy and happy listening!
Sadly same. Thankfully I haven't lost any loved ones or close friends, I've made enough money from unemployment due to covid to save up a surgery medical fund and I made the push to presenting full time and so far have passed wonderfully and feel so much more confident with the mask.  Now if I can just find a well paying new job, I'm set.
Thank you! Made me unbelievably happy. I hope the same for you in the new year! üéâ

Wtf
Alright I‚Äôm done lol  Happy New Years everyone
This is how I felt after reading the preview, they just skirt over the things she does for the villagers, delivering milk for the food they make for dumb cinderella jokes. That in itself told me the writers didn't care about that and only the "I wanna get married and I'm such a klutz and everyone knows bit" I was prepared for her to be silly kind of like Ange was with her princely vibes but this goes beyond that to the point it just made reading it awkward and uninteresting.   She wants to be Narmaya but doesn't have the range. At all.
Personally I don't talk when I'm uncomfortable, so I guess I want to know if they're alright. Like if I notice someone not talking I want to know if they're nervous/angry/worried they'll be judged/etc
Why are the stops so close together?
That‚Äôs harder than anything I‚Äôve ever done and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all in the day for you front liners. Thank you. And take care of yourself. Many of you will have lasting scars from this shit that should never have happened.
Thats good, maybe if single player games works for you then maybe stick to those unless you got a group you can play multiplayer with.
Send that little punk to Moscow Mitch. That‚Äôll change it‚Äôs tune.
I'm not talking about holding anyone accountable. The government *is* accountable to corporations.   The government caters to corporations and the wealthy, specifically because they have no reason to be accountable to average people.   They're accountable *specifically* to the people who are powerful because that makes *them* more powerful.
Back in the day, Eminem was accused of homophobia. Mainly because he kept saying the ‚Äúf‚Äù word in his raps. To prove them wrong, him and Elton did the song ‚ÄúStan‚Äù at the Grammys. It was supposed to be like ‚Äúsee?!?!? Elton likes me. I‚Äôm not homophobic.‚Äù  It didn‚Äôt really land the way he was hoping.
Yeah right, you‚Äôre probably a teen looking for attention online.

I think companies have 60-90 days after the quarter ends to release earnings depending on company size. Since this is end of year, we'll get the more detailed 10-K instead of the quarterly 10-Q.
I read both. I have voted republican all of my voting life untill 2016. I love a good conspiracy as much as the next. From fake moon landings to reptilian news reporters. But these  republicans today, seems like they eat lead paint chips. It's the craziest shit I've ever seen.
Jesus, god, her face is as white as her dress
Congress would still likely have to certify it, just like they have to certify the results of the electoral college. This headline would likely be the same even if we'd gotten rid of the EC.
Thank you. What‚Äôs that?  This was my first test. The froede looks ok?
Look it's honestly not bad. The problem that all of these maps fail to recognize, is that people want to use their cars the way they wish and not have to plan every stop, and they certainly don't want to pay 20k more for the privilege.   I can't justify paying the amount they want for a main car (when I want to tow, go 4wding and drive long distances on driving holidays), and for a second car (for the wife to drive around town etc.) it is just too damn expensive.
HEADLINE: ‚Äú Habs want Pierre ‚Äú  McGuire reads the news and starts crying
I really don‚Äôt get why? Mitch has more power than the president. He can disagree and blocked what ever he chooses even if it‚Äôs for the greater good for all Americans. He came keep his job longer than anyone else and finally earn 14k a month while laughing in the face of hurting Americans. 6 more years is way to much, then another 6 and another 6, Mitch is the 666.
We‚Äôve been there for decades (see McCarthyism) but now we‚Äôve perfected it.
He was forced to resign. It was on the news.
Did it though? What was so bad about it?
Happy new year lan.   It's magic ;D.
No he hasn‚Äôt told 20k lies and the article plainly states that it also counts misleading information as well and There‚Äôs a difference. You saying that this Trump has lied 20k times is a lie. Trump giving his opinion that Obama did or didn‚Äôt want to do something is not a lie at worst it‚Äôs misleading but nobody know what Obama wanted or didn‚Äôt want to do. If Trump is a con-man and he‚Äôs been doing it his whole life and that‚Äôs the only reason he is where he is today do you really think that he would be such a bad one? Every politician is a con-Man/Woman  What other person? Again I‚Äôm confused by your logic if Trump is a con man would he not want to do what people wanted him to do? Would he not do everything in his power to save face in the public eye to win re-election? So England is the roughly the same position as us (actually worse) but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Trump might be average it‚Äôs just because everyone else is also terrible?   Yep you‚Äôve got me I can‚Äôt explain away that the US is 4% of the population to be exact 4.25% why would I try to explain that away?  Well you are wrong about this one there are possible reasons that it could be explained. 1( I know people who have been tested once and got sent two positive test results. And 2( remember all those developing countries? How many of them are able to get the same amount of testing that we have in America?   I agree but that‚Äôs not Trumps fault. If a sports team is doing bad is the blame solely on the manager? No it‚Äôs usually on the entire team. I know that Trump handled it poorly but I also think that most other countries handled it poorly and it‚Äôs stupid to act like Trump is the only reason that a GLOBAL PANDEMIC is killing people  Agreed nothing Biden has done makes anything that Trump has done Right or Wrong but I‚Äôm just saying I don‚Äôt think Biden would have handled it better although even if he did handle it worse everyone would still be worshiping him because it‚Äôs just a trend now to hate Trump   If you want to say that Trump will go down in history as the president with the worst response to a Global pandemic than that‚Äôs your opinion I guess even if there is probably plenty of worse options but that‚Äôs not what you said you said he was the worst President in US history and that‚Äôs just not true

Sure, I don't disagree but that wasn't the topic of discussion, specifically the debate was around one small niche issue (same with the meme), not the system in its entirety.  The whole meme was that women can play into the system to a comparable level as a man   (original tweet was: "using a guy for friends is just as bad as a guy using a girl for sex" https://twitter.com/DaSkrubKing/status/1343664046080479232?s=19 )

Well, the biggest argument about abortion is when does life begin/when does the baby become not a part of the woman.  So no, not really.  I get that the cells do live, but they also live before conception so that also kinda fucks with ur logic
Very nice! How much for a right hand carry, 50DS, hood as shown, with a Olight Baldr mini on the rail, G-Code or Safariland screw positions? Thanks!
ABSOLUTELY!
I agree we should help disadvantaged kids. But kids from hard circumstances still deserve a chance to live. Doesnt justify killing them.
I'll give you that too
No clue how they decide, but I would definitely be taking part of they held votes.
When someone shows you who they are, believe them,  She showed that she is, well, a rather nasty AH and now she's trying to gaslight you into believing that she's all sweet and nice. People can change but she would have apologized to you and faced up to her bad behavior  NTA

The Democrats want to keep giving out money, having our great great grandkids paying our debts, instead of opening up.  You think the vaccine is the magic bullet? U think you can hide from a bad flu, well the flu kills kids, covid really doesn't. The sooner we open up the better.  That is why Cuomo continues to lose in court case after court case, and other governor's. They over stepped their authority. The fact that its being praised while they send sick to nursing homes is beyond me.  Democrats also attached a bunch of random bs to bills that should be covid only
And it's "you're" cryingüòÅ

I really have no idea about what available for a medical card. I have chronic intermittent back pain. I'll be fine for months and then be in pain for 6+ weeks. Is that enough to to be able to get a medical card? And would I be able to find something edible. I don't like to smoke it
Yes please abs let me fuck you all night and fill and cover you in cum

My cabelas just puts an identifying tape on the box, so you can browse the store before leaving.
You can listen for free. Read the manual and see if you can pickup the local NOAA weather radio station.   Amateur radio tests are easy to pass if you want to do more than listen.
Had an 85 suburban with the 5.7 diesel. I had my glow plugs hooked up to a manual button like this so I could get it to start. Standard key switch just couldn't last long enough to get her started in the cold Idaho mornings.
It was weird because I was imagining doing this at my theater, and then BOOM they were at my theater.
I hear this image
Don't be naive. They released it immediately because it was positive for them. Now that we have body cameras on officers, we now need to turn control over the footage to an independent agency and legislate specific rules on how and when the video is released.  Otherwise we will continue to have tapes released by the police immediately when it absolves them, and require court orders when it doesn't.

Yo on that last point what about all the asexual sex repulsed antinatalists? We exist.  What about all the female/enby/trans antinatalists? How tf some of us gon be incels if we're female/enby/trans?  One thing I've noticed about natalism is it is actually way more eugenics then antinatalism could ever be. To procreate, you are actively stating that your genes are the best and deserve to be passed on, and that links can only be made with people who are "like you" (bc otherwise why not just adopt). Some people even say the tribalist shit of "we can't let X group outnumber us!!!1!1". Istg I've actually heard some of this shit from my mom  Edit: Then again I can only be so mad at this, it is from r/teenagers after all, they're all still kids. Ofc, so am I, but that's beside the point.

Just a quick debate, no offense to you : First of all the universe does not only not give a shit about the date, but it doesn‚Äôt give a crap at all. The only thing keeping us alive is our will to live, even if a god exists.   Second of all, it may be that the subject such as covid and climate that thing will get worse, but you cannot specify that as a generality, since other things can define generality as well.  That‚Äôs all, open for discussion if you‚Äôre up for it

I mean when it comes to RAM for gaming I would go at least 3200 MHz with 32 GB RAM. If you‚Äôre gonna do some 4K movie editing, virtualization, or anything that utilizes a lot of ram then you should go 64 GB with 3600 MHz. Honestly a difference of 133 MHz is very negligible.

Just take a budget b460 board and you should easily stay around ¬£300, ¬£140 cpu, ¬£80-100is mainboard, ¬£50-70ish for ram. There is little reason to spend more money on a board unless you need more ports than the budget ones can offer. Sure being limited in ram speed sucks but the speed increase isn‚Äôt worth the ¬£50 to go z490 if you don‚Äôt go for the 10600kf at the same time.

Earlier coaches played the hell out of Curry. There were games he played all 48 minutes. Fuck that.  I love that Kerr and the current staff keep his minutes down. It can be frustrating when you think about the numbers he could have if he played more minutes but I think this will pay dividends here in the back half of Curry's career.

Honestly forgot Josh Allen went to Wyoming. He was such a great story, I agree he‚Äôs more of a super rare development than common place. Every draft there is G5 and D2 QBs taken and they almost always bust. Wentz was the best D2 QB prospect EVER and he still sucked after his MVP level year that looks more and more like an outlier. Lance is an athletic guy with a great arm but a bad mechanic and an even worse mind for making reads. Wilson is super athletic at BYU but no telling how it‚Äôll translate to the NFL. I think they‚Äôll both bust but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Fields may or may not be good, depends more on his attitude and work ethic which I know nothing about. Lawrence is the only safe pick this year. QB class is really just Lawrence and scraps this year, not sure why everyone is so high on them

[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-07-mn-149-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-07-mn-149-story.html)  **Informant Puts CIA at Ranch of Agent‚Äôs Killer**  **By¬†HENRY WEINSTEIN JULY 5, 1990** TIMES STAFF WRITER  The Central Intelligence Agency trained Guatemalan guerrillas in the early 1980s at a ranch near Veracruz, Mexico, owned by drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, one of the murderers of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration report made public in Los Angeles.  [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-05-mn-131-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-05-mn-131-story.html)  **On Feb. 9, according to the report, Harrison told DEA agents Hector Berrellez and Wayne Schmidt that the CIA used Mexico's Federal Security Directorate, or DFS, "as a cover, in the event any questions were raised as to who was running the training operation."**  **Harrison also said that "representatives of the DFS, which was the front for the training camp, were in fact acting in consort with major drug overlords to ensure a flow of narcotics through Mexico into the United States."**  **At some point between 1981 and 1984, Harrison said, "members of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police arrived at the ranch while on a separate narcotics investigation and were confronted by the guerrillas. As a result of the confrontation, 19 {Mexican police} agents were killed. Many of the bodies showed signs of torture; the bodies had been drawn and quartered."**  In a separate interview last Sept. 11, Harrison told the same two DEA agents that CIA operations personnel had stayed at the home of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, one of Mexico's other major drug kingpins and an ally of Caro Quintero. The report does not specify a date on which this occurred.

According to Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sources and documents, the Mexican drug-trafficking cartel that kidnapped, tortured and murdered DEA agent Enrique Camarena in the central city of Guadalajara in February 1985 operated until then with virtual impunity -- not only because it was in league with Mexico's powerful Federal Security Directorate (DFS), but because it believed its activities were secretly sanctioned by the CIA.  Whether or not this was the case, DEA and Mexican officials interviewed for this article said that at a minimum, the CIA had turned a blind eye to a burgeoning drug trade in cultivating its relationship with the DFS and pursuing what it regarded as other U.S. national security interests in Mexico and Central America.  (.....)  CIA protectiveness of the DFS surfaced publicly in 1981, when the chief of the Mexican agency at that time, Miguel Nazar Haro, was indicted in San Diego on charges of involvement in a massive cross-border car-theft ring. The FBI office at the U.S. Embassy here cabled strong protests, calling Nazar Haro an "essential contact for CIA station Mexico City."  San Diego U.S. Attorney William Kennedy disclosed in 1982 that the CIA was trying to block the case against Nazar Haro on grounds that he was a vital intelligence source in Mexico and Central America. Kennedy was subsequently fired by President Reagan. At the time, Nazar Haro also was heavily involved in drug trafficking, witnesses in two U.S. trials have testified.  By the early 1980s, the DFS also had gained a reputation as practically a full-time partner of the Mexican drug lords. In 1985, after the Camarena murder, the government disbanded it in an effort to root out corruption and repair Mexico's image. But many former DFS agents remain active, especially in the Mexico City police department.

Literally the dumbest Chinese pissmonger alive. Masks dont do shit when there is more spread after people have been wearing them. Washing hands when. Everytime you touch anything is a fetish of the absurd.   Regardless. There is a little thing called profit. If somebody makes you all sick how much does it cost to cure you. Profit has manipulated that market completely rigging it. Whether it is wearing masks, sanitizer, tests, and vaccines. Super mega money overnight. Now guaranteed money when millions need a new vaccine passport.   Not once has medicine improved the service has become worse. More doctors more hospitals haven't opened instead existing hospitals have closed. Where they have said who dies. It has only been Covid.  More people have died from lockdown than Granny virus statistically only killing old people above 70 or those with existing health conditions. It has killed almost nobody else. Except the millions threatened to the point of extremes by nothing else. Less than 1 percent death rate.  Brain damage you are insane. The damage this virus has caused on the healthy who aren't even sick but instead are sold lies has been astronomical. The worst recession in 600 years has caused brain damage.  Of course somebody getting all their news from one source regurgitates vomit. Wishng you sickness and ill health. You don't deserve anything else. You are a Chinese pissmonger.

I could forgive the game if it was "The Postman: The Game", since i honestly feel like thats what the game wanted to be. But Hideo Kojima was far too much up his own ass and nobody would just stop him and politely tell him "This is stupid. Please stop being stupid.". I honestly feel like this and MGSV was just him blowing everybody elses money so he could hang out with "famous" stars and other directors and producers and not actually about making a game. Because when it came time to get to the "game" part, there was no game. Like there isnt even an AMERICA in this game! Its the SCOTTISH MOORS! America doesnt look like Scotland! What the hell is this?!  I feel like if this game was just about logistics and really leaned into more into being "The Postman", which is also about a post apocalyptic America thats basically run by a roving bandit clan. But by being the guy who sends people their mail, you are kinda rebuilding America and peoples faith in a government that doesnt actually exist...yet. IF he could have tapped into that idea more and had his ~~TOTALLY NOT SCOTLAND~~ America get better as you sent more packages and had actual explorable buildings and decayed cities to give you a sense of what was lost in his version of America, I think the game would be an ACTUAL GAME. Would it have been amazing or not? I dont know. But what is here is barely anything and comes off Hideo using people's money to have cool weekends with Hollywood.

I will probably get downvoted but this is really what I feel. Also I never ask anyone why they‚Äôre so quiet, but I get the question.

I just embrace nihilism and tell myself that it doesn't matter if I get rejected and there's nothing to lose by trying.  It also helps to recognize that she is a human being just like I am, and has had a whole lifetime of experiences, doubts, insecurities, triumphs, etc.  So who knows what might happen? Just try not to be creepy and approach her as a person. Reserve the carnal desires for IF things move that way.

&gt; Realists have argued that the prevalence of anarchy in the state system requires individual states to be ruthlessly self-seeking. Because there is no suprastate actor capable of enforcing international law, each state must provide for its own security. Thus, a structural anarchy is also inevitably a self-help regime: every government reserves the right to decide what is just or necessary for itself and to take up arms to pursue or enforce that decision. Because the best way to achieve security under anarchy is to be powerful (both militarily and economically), self-help leads naturally to power-maximizing behaviour. In an anarchic state-system, **power-maximizing behaviour is therefore the normal behaviour of all states.**  [Anarchy by Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/anarchy)  It descends to look like Somalia, where local war chiefs control their areas by brute force and there is no system of justice or laws to hold people accountable for their actions  Only the strongest and most violent win in that world

You‚Äôre right, Rudolph fuckin Giuliani wasn‚Äôt their mayor for like a decade and their AG for just as long. Definitely no Republican policies in there at all. You do realize like half their legislature is Rs right, just like California has more Republican voters than Alabama has people. Just because they show blue in the EC or have a D mayor doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs 100% Democrat controlled. NYC, like every other city/state/country/planet/solar system, doesn‚Äôt exist without influence and things outside of their control can affect circumstances. It‚Äôs embarrassing that I had to explain this to you knowing full well you‚Äôre not worth the effort.

Don‚Äôt worry too hard about saving them right from the beginning. You‚Äôll get units from arena milestones, arena crystals, main story content, monthly quests, and login calendars.

Adkkilla, I'm not advocating that you or anyone else should sell at $3, I certainly wouldn't. In fact I would mortgage my house to raise funds to buy more at that level.   OceanTomo, then please, stop reading my comments. And I'm not "Bashing" either the stock or the Company.   Bridgetofar, it wouldn't have any impact on the negotiations, in my opinion. They aren't trying to sell a Market Cap. They are selling the company's IP. That isn't affected by the company's Market Cap.  Alphacpa, I sincerely hope you are right. It would be a precipitous drop to the $3 Range. I'm not trying to convince to anyone that it WILL go that low. But I think it could. And the longer we go before Microvision themselves say something the easier it will be for it to get there.  Look, I am NOT saying it WILL go to the $3 Range. What I am saying is that it certainly WOULDN'T surprise me if it did and if it did I would be a buyer.   I still absolutely believe that they will sell the company for a huge multiple of todays share price and I still believe they will sell it in the next four or five or six months. No one seemed to question it when it hit $10 share on no news and no one should be surprised if it hits $3 a share on no news. Hope, fear and opportunity is what is driving the share price at the moment. Hundreds of Millions of Dollars were made (on paper) as the shares went to $10. Hundreds million more has been made (on a different piece of paper) while the share price has dropped to todays close. If Microvision makes an announcement on Monday Billions will be made on the way up again. If they don't Hundreds of Millions could still be made going the other way. Traders will take the opportunity EITHER way. All I'm saying is don't be surprised when they do.

Yeah, but that's still a dick move. If the question is "tell us about a time you lost" your answer can't be "there was this time I won a race. I'm telling you about it so that the other 31 losers don't have to"; it's an arrogant answer.  If someone asks about draft whiffs for my team I'm not going to talk about how good Marlon Humphrey is and how people before us wish they had him, I'm going to talk about how much we would 100% take back Hollywood Brown.

The median personal income in the United States is roughly $36,000.  Someone making 1.5x or 2x that, compared to the average person, is well off yes.   This is completely irrelevant, in any case, if someone is making X amount of money and hasn't lost their job or any portion of their income from COVID then they should not get stimulus money. Simple as that.

RIP to The Finest
My parents refused to accept the my lifelong disability was a disability (migraines)...They pushed me hard to go to college, even though I did not have my disability under any sort of control whatsoever. I failed multiple times and kept getting pushed to go back to college. They made it literally the only option available. I wasn't able to graduate. I then proceeded to get fired from all my jobs because I kept missing days due to my disability, and they still insisted I just wasn't trying hard enough, when literally all I did was try my absolute best to pretend I was normal because they had drilled it into me that I was just not trying hard enough.   Turns out missing 7 out of 30 days a month to debilitating pain and therefore missing school and work days does not make it easy to function as an adult. I went through some tough times where I believed it was all my fault, and they still won't admit that my migraines are a significant detriment to my life. To put it in perspective, I missed on average 12 weeks to pain per year, that's 3ish months. Obviously no employer could keep an employee like that. And because my parents never saw it as a disability, I didn't even have the government protection against being fired because I wasn't classed as "disabled" even though I was diagnosed before the age of 7.  I've only managed to get it under control this past year with a lot of help from my partner, who is patient, kind and understanding. I still get migraines, but I've managed to start a small business a few months ago and I can't get fired from my own venture!

Is this show any good? I've been on the fence about it.
I hadn't remembered that after the first listen. Keyes said he had experience disappearing people's cars. Josh talks about potential call ins to the up line about Keyes running people off the road. The hints in that tidbit makes me wonder if the girl fell into that category... And how he knew about her grandmother.  It also made me realize how few missing people reports describe the victim's car. People disappeared heading to the store, taking a drive, etc. but no description of the vehicle.
Everyone forgets my poor little Esther. She's still my favorite unit ever in FFBE. Such a fun and welldesigned character.   She's one of the very few GLEX characters that I can agree with the philosophy behind the design.

You‚Äôre not a hypocrite because you are genuinely looking at your actions and responses and listening to what he‚Äôs saying.  The issue here is that he isn‚Äôt doing the same thing, and trust me he knows it on some level. He gets away with it by turning it around and then, because he knows you‚Äôll listen to him with empathy, he projects onto you and tells him that it‚Äôs actually YOU that is ‚Äúbad.‚Äù  He does it because he is selfish, he doesn‚Äôt actually care whether he hurts you, and this method works. I mean look at this, how many hours have you now spent searching for what you did wrong, making excuses for him, desperately searching for some crumb of logic to explain away how much he is hurting you? Do you really think he does that for you?   Unless he takes the time to dig DEEP and make some serious shifts on his own, he isn‚Äôt going to change. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs an evil person, but it does mean he will keep twisting your head up to get what he wants, to avoid ever really owning his shit. Love without manipulation is one of the most beautiful things we can ever experience and he is missing it, and you‚Äôre letting him rob you of it too.   I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre piecing this stuff together in therapy. PM me if you want someone to talk to. If it isn‚Äôt already obvious, I have been there where you are too.

Is it just me or is the first one who walked in and to the left and just stood there likely female? Something about their body language just said "this guy definitively isn't going to him me" and when the home owner did just that, stood there in a fetal position. I have a feeling they did not expect anyone to be home.
It's not ruthlessly slaughtering anything, it's a medical procedure that's usually done early on in the pregnancy.
My mother's hospital was pulling ER doctors into OB because the only OB doctor had COVID. One of them had to deliver twins when they haven't done a delivery since med school over a decade prior, and simply couldn't remember anything they had learned about it. They apparently froze and couldn't even remember a simple "clamp, clamp, cut" instruction my mother gave them for the umbilical. Not only that, but they cut staff, so it would have been only one doctor/one nurse except that it was early in the morning and the night shift nurse agreed to stay a couple hours after her 12-hour overnight shift. There was no nursery nurse, and one of the twins was sideways. The hospital was VERY lucky on that one.  I definitely agree, I do NOT want someone taking care of me outside of their areas of practice, and I would obviously prefer to have well-rested staff in appropriate numbers to handle everything. It's crazy right now.

I too quit awhile back. I remember it was after they nerfed the raids &amp; made them harder &amp; players would drop out all the time. They've suckered me back in, about a year ago now, with all the events, which have had great rewards &amp; new parts. I still don't think you need to spend money since it takes a while to unlock all the factions anyway, but the event packs were worth it. Except this last garage one. That was more cosmetic.

It would certainly be a **bold** strategy to write off three main/recurring characters in one season. Nahn, Gorgeiou, and now one of the other little-developed bridge characters too?

I hope I am not coming off like a lunatic... but wouldn‚Äôt that be the deciding factor if this is a pathogenic infection?

But wouldn‚Äôt that be the defining factor??? Wouldn‚Äôt that solve all these questions of whether this is pathogenic organisms or if it is some other issue going on within the body???

Not sure if the reaction is delayed from the sentence but looks like the sentence of murder garnered no reaction until the "life in prison without parole" part. Like didn't even bat an eye to murder.

You're right. I can watch it so many times but i will still feel same or similiar as on first watch. And i love these feelings coming from this anime.

Thanks! I've tried mixing it with water and just giving it right out of the can. I even got some dehydrated raw samples from the vet and tried reconstituting it. He won't eat it like that, though he will if I give it as is and mix it in. He's like a little kid with vegetables when it comes to that, even when he's begging for food otherwise. No milk, fish, or any people food at all. I started with one of the Purina One Indoor blends. Then he wouldn't stop eating my older cat's Purina One Tender Bites. I think I've got either Science Diet or Iams low-residue for him. I need to get back to tossing it with Miralax. I was putting it in the water but I don't think he was getting enough of it.

This is the first time i'm spending new years alone. I live with my parents and sister but after such a rough year with all that's going on nobody has the strength to do something fun. Not even dinner together. I'm happy overall with my life, job, SO, friends, but it's such a strange year and its a strange vibe as you said. Seeing everyone else on social media gathering because here in Brazil no one cares about the pandemic anymore doesn't help also. But I kinda see it as peaceful as well, just you, doing what you wnat, no one to bother you. It's definitely a strange feeling but that's ok. Stay well and happy new year!

I can vouch for the Areo m5, and since you are wanting it grey there's practically no downside to going with raw or blemished parts (Aeros blemishes are almost perfect anyway, at least mine were, never was able to find any markings on them).   As far as color, once you get everything, do a test fit to make sure it all fits together like you want it to, then take it back apart and take it to get coated. You will probably have a decent amount of local options, depending on where you live of course. My FFL does cerakoting in his garage and coated my handgaurd, upper, cheek rest and butt plate for $120. I'm sure most gun shops either do it in house or can direct you to who does theirs.

Switching from Alliance to Horde was day and night difference for me. So many more pug groups for content and actually decent battleground experience. There are dedicated players on both sides of course so if you find a good guild it wont matter at all.  Alliance has slightly better racials for pvp or so they say.
But they aren't assholes all the time

I'm not going to say that you're a morally depraved person as I don't like making snap judgements, especially about strangers. However, I'd say that you're making a pretty good case for yourself. Unless you're just doing a very poor job of describing the narrative, there is no excuse to recognize the actions you speak of as anything other than vile.

London here, and I've jetted over to Europe for day trips before, but that's only a few hours flying. Had a few fun ones where I booked an early morning flight home for the next day - and after my day trip just spent the night in clubs or bars before heading straight back to the airport.
happy new years!!!!!

OP didn‚Äôt say that they have *left* Reddit. He referred to people who had *decided* to leave Reddit. They may not have left Reddit yet, or changed their minds.
Yes can confirm. We dont talk in the Bus.
It's tedious talking to someone that doesn't engage
Ok sunshine. Whatever you say.
Every time I debate people in this topic it always starts with ‚Äúbro there are 2 genders that‚Äôs science.‚Äù And then ends with blatant anti intellectualism.
It‚Äôs possible, but unlikely. A1cs are 3 month average measurements of your blood sugars. The higher the blood sugar, the higher the a1c. The only way an a1c draw can be inaccurate is if you have a specific type of anemia/blood clotting issue.
Again you're too scared to prove your experience and credentials because you know you can't match up against real scientists. Like I said, it's okay not to know anything but just don't force everyone else into your uninformed opinion.   What are the hazards of facemasks? Please enlighten me.   The science proved smoking was bad, Doctors came out in 1964   https://www.history.com/news/cigarette-ads-doctors-smoking-endorsement  I'm not paid by anyone, I'm just not an idiot who didn't fail school like you. I know the science and that's what I speak in. You speak in hyperbole and misinformation and sensationalism without any evidence and logical chain.
Thanks, but the budget is already passed with the current list, cant make anymore changed that would make the price go up.

One last thing that has been baffling me, how DOES the scoring work? I've noticed when I use the EML with max upgrades (one shot, one kill baby!) the score per-kill is a nice round, consistent, satisfyingly high number. But with any sort of missile, it seems to differ wildly based on criteria I don't fully grasp. I know the score increases if your target has "stars" for being on a hot streak, and the type/cost of the bird you take down seems to be important as well. There's definitely something else though, and I haven't figured it out yet. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe the missile flight time/velocity on impact is factored in multiplicatively? It's all very confusing, but I feel like if can get to the bottom of exactly how this calculation works, I could really optimize my scoring. Thanks again for letting me pick your brain here, you've undoubtedly already put me vastly ahead of what I'd have been able to figure out by myself in the past few days.
You aren't paying 500 more paid jewels compared to a normal paid banner if you snag Narwhal's Daughter on the 2000 jewel summon.  In a normal paid banner, if you pull what you wanted on the second payment, then you will have spent a total of 3000 jewels.  In this new paid setup, if you snag what you wanted on the second payment, then you will have spent a total of 3000 jewels. **You can't spend 2000 jewels without spending 1000 jewels first.**  In either case, if you obtain what you wanted on the second payment, then you will have spent a total of 3000 jewels.

Don‚Äôt listen to anyone telling you to do it one specific way.   You need to take a step back and think abut how YOU build and use a sorting method that fits that.   For me I am more concerned with a specific piece and would rather figure out color later. This means that sorting by type is the way to go. If you build by color that‚Äôs the way to go.

The Kid Detective  Despite the title (which makes it sound like a subpar family movie, when it's actually R rated), this is a funny, tragic, and very well made noir deconstruction of stories like Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys. It follows a 31 year old detective who used to be a beloved child detective who has finally gotten a real adult case of a murder. I wouldn't say this is a full on comedy, as it's not afraid to get pretty dark and serious, but it does have several funny moments. It's very well acted, directed, and written. If you love noir detective movies, I really recommend it.
Damnit they need to make a game with killable children so you can take out the Dickish ones

If she is being ‚Äúreclassified‚Äù as an independent contractor her work arrangements need to change in accordance with that. Look up the twenty factor test.

well it doesn't sound like it's causing you distress or harm. As long as you feel it doesn't interfere with how you live your life, it sounds like its just a quirk or maybe the result of how you were raised/some unconscious ideas about cleanliness or what needs to stay clean. I would keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't develop into something harmful but overall you sound fine in my opinion!

I ultimately had to reject Marxist Leninism because it has too dogmatic, and because it‚Äôs followers are far to willing to make use of violence and repression. I now hold to a more Bernsteinian ‚Äúdemocratic evolutionary socialism‚Äù. I believe there should be a strong public sector holding important areas of the economy, but do not support full nationalization. Outside of nationalization, there should also be public property on more regional or municipal levels. I support worker cooperatives, and think there should be more of them. Small businesses are good. For medium sized private businesses and large corporations I support strong unions and codetermination. I hold with Bernstein that ‚Äúthe movement is everything, the final goal is nothing‚Äù. I do not know if private property will eventually disappear completely

hi, yes they count. I'm sorry that you're in pain and that you've felt the need to hurt yourself.   maybe try talking to a therapist or counsellor if you can? Sometimes it might be helpful to talk it out with someone who's professionally trained. It might cost money where you are, though there are often organizations that offer therapy for free (particularly if you live in a big city). If it's not an option, there are many free help/hotlines that are especially for youth. For example, Canada has Kids Help Phone but I'm sure you could look up your country and also "youth helpline" and you will probably get some results. It may help to talk it out. I'm sorry you're struggling. Just a suggestion of course.  Also, ignore the 3 mean/vile/gross comments below. I am SO sorry about that. :( you are NOT pathetic, you're not "attention-seeking" and I'm so so sorry that they said something like that. It's not true.

Good. This is the US meddling in the affairs of other countries. We are most imperialist war-mongering country on earth and largest threat to world peace. We overthrow democratically elected sovereign governments for breakfast with complete disregard for the people of the country.   Maybe China should invade the US for how we treat peaceful protestors at standing rock and occupy Wall Street?  We are also the worlds LARGEST penal colony. And we force those inmates to participate in slave labor.   At a certain point we have to ask ourselves... are we the baddies? Yes is the answer.
The worst part is this meme format of 2020 not ending is plastered all over reddit too
I just got here too congrats
We don't though. You describe yourself as a communist in another comment. How is forcing other people to lose rights communist? Again, that's what a stupid, obvious troll account would say. I'm not sure why I bothered to argue in good faith with you. You obviously aren't with me.
Explain.
Can't you swap out the headbands?
Here's an example of the second problem. The first run is from running the Date Pick in Keypad mode, and the second in Calendar mode:  `12-31 16:52:48.481 U 244814@4: 12/31/20 12:00 AM`  `12-31 16:52:57.546 U 244815@4: 1/1/21 12:00 AM`
Happy new year! Bring on 21!
Happy New Year!
Stop simping
Thanks!  I‚Äôll check them out.
He's still getting open, just needs to bring the ball in more. Tough hands is a fixable problem to me. I'm still confident he turns into a quality player.
I can't believe I'm relying on TB and Rui and not Beal or Westbrook to close this game for us
