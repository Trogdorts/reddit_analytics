Hey that's great, I mean it.   In the other progress pic comment section there was a Redditor who talked about posting his own progress pic six months ago and mentioned he'd already put it back on and was dieting again.  I'm not saying this to be an asshole, but the reality is that the vast majority of people who get healthy end up putting the weight back on. Do some research and find out what a healthy relationship with food looks like (if you haven't already).   As good as you feel now (and you've earned it), you'll feel equally as depressed if you wind up taking another ride on the rolly-polly-coaster.   Find some healthy recipes, pick up an active hobby, maybe grow your own veggie garden and you'll find out junk food doesn't actually taste all that good. And give yourself a break once in a while, you're doing alright.
once a guy pulled a gun on me and i ran like 300m really fast but then i stopped so i think it would help you like in a 100m sprint but not more than 300m for sure because you would run out of energy 
It requires a lot of memory and many phones can barely run fortnite as is. Give it more time. Also I rather have bugs fixed and optimization than stats. 
Calm down, that's not what OP said at all. You just wanted to get angry about something.

So I can’t lie I’ve never actually measured myself (I don’t get to work with any live pangolins) but they can stick out their tongue about 10 inches according to the internet. Check out [this](https://pangolin2017.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/0c0e11dfd70d183bd384e0faec4fa95c-jpg.png?w=900) picture to see how pangolins keep such a long tongue in their bodies.

Wow. What on earth did the first person say to lead us down this road?  Edit: I’m not sure if I should also come down this road but I do have a real question about canary website. I first learn about it a couple years ago when I lived in Hong Kong and was member of Hong Kong police force. My son had new friend who was studying for semester who was from US. I google his name on work computer and the site called canary has link with his name on it.   For some reason site was blocked at work and I found strange because as member of police they don’t block much on work computer. I use phone to look at it and the information about my sons friend seemed very bad and they paint him as extremest. I met the young man and talk with him and I wonder if this site is a trusted source.   I’m sorry if I help feed the negative first comments but I have real question. 
I agree with all that, but saying in your original post that it was a "normal" serpent is clearly wrong. Jesus I can't believe I got downvoted for pointing that out. wtf
Because reddit is full of left-wingers. Which is ironic considering reddit was founded by people that believed in freedom of speech, which is a Libertarian rather than a leftist position.
That and she looks young. Which means pop culture and social media and liberal teachers have a big influence still.  Give her some time.

Although it’s true I’d take it with a grain of salt. People said Brazil was also doing ok now look at us... Being anti-corruption when everyone is corrupt because otherwise you cannot govern means that it’ll come to a point where judges and prosecutors can arrest people by preference. Look at China, Russia and 90s Italy “anti-corruption struggles”.

I’ve missed you you troll
You are 100% right and she is 100% wrong.  Don't let her take advantage of you.  Tell her that if she's going to stay 5 days a week, she should technically be paying 75% of the rent, but you are only asking for less than a 1/5th.  If she refuses, then tell her you would like her to buy 75% of the groceries and pay for half the utilities.  If she still refuses, don't let her stay over...and consider if you want to date someone who is willing to take advantage of you like that.
WHERE ARE THEY?!
Well she didn't do it using Riot's broadcast, she did it on her personal twitter. If people don't like her tweets, then unfollow.   She and Kelsey have resolved things. Held an AMA to tackle the issue head on. I don't see what more she really needs to do.

My daughter was 5'7" at 14.  She has always been "older" for her age. She's mature, intelligent, comfortable around adults, gets good grades, and just carries herself like an older girl,which she's been mistaken for often.  I think it just depends on the 14 year old (not that I'd condone mine dating an 18 year old).  And I've also known 18 year guys who didn't have a great maturity level. 
Most likely yes

Yeah, it is - the benefits of a 2nd round pick would be felt in Seattle for far longer than a single "revenge game" for Earl and now you'll get nothing for him. Ridiculous.
Yeah, was meant for the tweet itself.
I thought your intention was a very nasty one, namely to do a "pre-vanquish taunt" while the cactus dies of your fire damage over time. :) Thus I wondered why you wrote "instant karma **cactus**" and why the cactus jumped into the water.  But I know this situation when I shoot at someone and then notice that they just want to collect a gnome. Or wanted to collect because sometimes I notice it too late. ;)
I’d love it!

In the internet settings on your switch change the dns server to manual and input 045.055.142.122  Test the internet connection and it should say registration is required to use this network.

Yeah, that’s pretty much what I thought. I felt a little confused because you mentioned 85% in your last reply and I didn’t remember any day where you would start with 85%.   Oh wait, you edited that you’re doing this FSL method with the amrap set percentage? Is that correct? How does it even work? lol   Or is it something that y’all are doing already taking into account that it’ll take some 3 months to use percentages based on your true 1rm?

That happens throughout the series. The writer realizes she hasn't been used, she promises to be better, sort of does something, then the writer has no interest in using her again.  Even in the puppet fight, she's not the one doing the fighting. Not many accomplishments.

In 2014 I went to visit family in my home state. My cousin, who I once lived with, could barely recognize me. It doesn't help that my hair had grown out. But that thought resonated with me. When I got back home, I just started to make small changes to my portions and completely cut out soda. Lost about 80 pounds in a few months.  Ended up moving back to that state a year later (almost to the date) and my whole family was incredibly impressed. It's really a great feeling to know that my effort had results but nothing feels better than not having man boobs or a big gut.
Me too.

Stop spewing nonsense. 
I think Halloween 4 gets easily dismissed because it is fourth in a franchise, and the general opinion is that any franchise gets worse with each consecutive sequel.   On it's own though, Halloween 4 is excellent. The performances were solid, to the point where you actually care what happens to the characters (essential to effective horror). I also enjoyed how brisk and straightforward the film was. No overly-contrived setups or distracting set pieces or plot elements. Kept things grounded and muted to give it that quasi-realism that made the original Halloween so scary.

&gt; My point is they definitely had issues with loading times post 1.0  But they don't NOW, which is what the thread is about...  &gt; therefor must be broken (its not) and nothing could be WGs fault.  Again, in the present moment, you wrote as if you were STILL having these issues NOW, and at no point do I say, or imply, WG can never be at fault for anything.  So is there a relevant argument you have about load times in the game's current state, which is what this thread is about, or are you going to take some more things out of context and apply it to issues from the past?
Would love to spread that

I missed an opportunity to pick up an 8 cpu server with 1tb of ram for 1500 :(
the worst thing i'm seeing here is the dead rotting corpse of a child (?????) in the bottom right corner, wtf is the context of that  also that post you showed about him "condoning assaulting children" could be way worse. Brennaniamcool's comment said it well:  &gt; "Older boys hurt phoebe today" Okay assuming "phoebe" is someone related to him (daughter) that's understandable he's pissed.  he's just pissed that his daughter was hurt, and probably wouldn't actually encourage people to beat up children.
are you me? I'm up 50+ though with Crabtree and DT but I still dont feel safe lol
That's a good one.  "sport-tuned suspension" is like "assault(-style) weapon"  Artistic license taken.

Did you get any explanation about Samantha?  &gt; I could see her crew wandering around as if nothing had happened. Where were they?  Do they know?  This sounds like it'd be in the Nevada desert instead of CA.  The terrain here is identical to some places the USA has been known to "visit".  And most of the state is gov't land (the "shoot first, shoot second, shoot again, if anything is still able to answer, you can ask questions," type).

I understand for immersion reasons why this would be the case, this week however felt like the spawn rate was far too low it seems like this would be the spawn rate for the 1st week in the cycle.  Majority of the community would appreciate if the spawn rate could be increased so we could have a better shot at least at getting the quest. On a more positive note, forsaken has been amazing thus far. Hats off to you guys for creating the best gaming experience i have ever had. 
Ok, great. So a couple questions first about server resets. Do doors close? If they are open does that mean someone has already come through? Does loot(I'm looking at you food..) respawn during restarts? The thing is, I have been playing all day(.63 DL'ing right now!) and have spent most of my time in big cities. All the doors are always open. But haven't seen a single person, heard a single gun shot. I picked a very low pop server bc it had good ping, figured i'd pve and learn the mechanics. Wondering if I am missing something here

I've had the same issue. Terrain deformation has caused me a lot of problems

Ok so I thought you might want to look at [HSR](https://ps2.fisu.pw/leaderboard/player//?item=703#hsr) of the AV Phalenx turret (seeing as that’s the only one you can aim precisely for the head with and even then, good luck.). We’re looking at an average of around 12% in the top 500 on all servers.  So now ask yourself, do you think your being reasonable suggesting this exceptional-rank implant should be used by headshoting infantry with the AV turret just so you can have one more shot, despite your target being dead already?

It's really cool that NJPW is starting to run the US.  If I was in LA, I would have been at these shows.  However, I still would rather experience NJPW in Japan.  I almost have the wife talked into a trip over to Tokyo to see WK and maybe NYD.  
You have struck at something which is a bit interesting about the American right, which I was just thinking about earlier.  The American conservative movement is composed of many different factions, that often disagree with each other. If you pay attention to the different members of the GOP, it is fairly obvious.  All parts share a shared goal of reducing government spending, and changing policies to encourage economic growth through deregulation. On social issues, foreign policy, and use of the military, there are many contested points.  The big one that most people like to bring up is the Religious Right. This group wishes to use the power of government to legislate morality. These people support bans on gay marriage and abortion, and are opposed to the legalization of drugs. This group is becoming less prominent, being replaced by....  The Constitutional Conservative, which is a name I just made up because it fits, are people who believe that the roll of the federal government should be reduced in all aspects, and efforts to legislate morality are both in vain, and beyond the scope of the federal government. These people generally support the right of the States to make decisions. Generally, these people support gay marriage, and do not support the federal ban on marijuana. Both for the same reason - it is not the job of the federal government to regulate such things. Thoughts on abortion tend to be mixed in this group, depending on how each person answers the moral questions of killing a fetus, and how that fits into the powers of the government.  The next group is the Neocons, who are most noted for being the most militaristic. These people support the use and maintenance of a strong global military presence to further American interests. This is also generally coupled with a softer approach to spending and welfare cuts, and often try to appeal to more moderate Democrats in elections.   The next big faction, and the newest, is the populists. Trump is the poster child for this. This group is very much focused on the wants and needs of the common working man, and other issues become secondary. Illegal immigration, trade negotiations, tax cuts, and regulation reduction are all primary focuses of this group, while more social concerns are often secondary. Things like gay marriage and abortion are not priories, one way or the other, so positions from individuals in this group will be mixed. Also, there is a very pro-military, but anti-war sentiment here - which focuses on deterrence through strength and training, rather than the Neocon interventionism.   The last major group I can think of right now are the Libertarians. Still not strong enough to stand on their own, many are a part of the GOP, or vote for GOP candidates. Their views are pretty simple: government has a military, enforces basic laws against things like murder and theft, and that's it. Legalize all recreational drugs, all guns, ditch as much regulation as possible, get the government out in every possible way. There are varying degrees of Libertarian, all the way to anarchists, who do not tend to vote Republican, but are still part of the right.  TL;DR: The American right is very diverse, and holds many conflicting views.

I think republicans are by their nature more tribal, that's a bad thing generally, but in politics it makes them better at playing the long game.

I think so. Cesare Borgia is using Caesar to mean a title rather than the person, so nihil goes much better than either nemo or nullus, but I am guessing that's why the nemo or nullus corruption happened: people used an adjective because they interpreted Caesar as a proper noun referring to JC himself, rather than as a noun meaning leader, or emperor or whatever.

Not everyone can go to the best school.  It’s always going to be easier to get into these colleges from schools with better reputations.   Quite simply logic and the students themselves are the things that get in the way of this being achieved. Rarely is admission to the ruling elite based purely on money.  Frequently it’s based on how well you get along with others.

The emergency brakes won't pop in the maxi chamber unless the psi is like below 30 psi.  So if the brakes weren't adjust good, or failed on the other side and the truck still has 50-70 psi the emergencies won't pop.  I think he ran inside, reset the parking brake and then it failed again, and still too much psi for the other side of the maxi chamber to pop the emergency brakes.   Either that or they are running with caged brakes (don't laugh i seen it once before)
Ahh. I may have misinterpreted it. (Was watching a youtube guide to this HBG).

Remember that argument names _don't have to match anything outside the method_.  They are only used _internally_.  You don't have an array of doubles, but you do have an array of ints, and you can substitute Integer for Double and int for double in the code.  You might have to make a small tweak here or there, but nothing major.  If you look at how `n` is used in that method, what can you conclude about it?
Just recently   Female boss who is alcoholic being way nicer to workmates who can stay up all night drinking with her at after work drinks.   She also attends those female empowerment workshops (which I also support) but somehow end up excluding all male teammates and treat them worse on purpose ... unless you stay up all night drinking with her.  I don't drink excessively because I drive and I am not a girl.  Annoying to deal with and yep unfair .

How is it racist? You're literally spouting racist shit and then calling people who call it out racist, nice one dude. I'll tell you what would happen, you would get your ass beat in about 30 seconds because you're demeaning someones humanity with your fucking microaggression bullshit. It has nothing to do with them being black, if you demeaned anyone else in a similar fashion they'd also take offense to it and if its something as significant as this you'd also likely get get your ass beat by them, regardless of ethnicity.

I was thinking forward, not backward. 
Can I consider that a drop?
So I'm certainly biased towards Kavanaugh on this one, but I'll try to be as neutral as possible.  President Trump nominated a new Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. When he was supposed to be confirmed, 4 women came forward, and accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault when he was younger. 3 of them have been determined to be false due to the accounts being extremely inconsistent, but one of the women, Dr. Christine Ford, has been taken seriously because she has been fairly consistent with her story. The only inconsistency that's really been made is the number of people who were at the scene of it, and even then she's provided a pretty good reason for it.  Something that adds more validity to the story is the fact that this has been discussed with (iirc) the democrats (or a government entity, I just know that this isn't the first time Ford has mentioned it) before he was nominated. Along with the fact that we know that Ford had some sort of trauma, as seen by her friends, colleagues, and therapist.   Now here's where we get into my opinion. At this point, it really doesn't matter, and I don't think that it can really be used against Kavanaugh, even though I don't even want him to be a Justice for 4th amendment issues. If it were more recent, and had the ability to be investigated in a way that could be accurate, then I'd say it should be a factor, but at this point it's all hearsay evidence, and he said she said statements.  Edit: added a line

Last company I worked for had a similar problem. I was on the IT team and we would take week-long shifts being on-call for any tech support issues for remote workers. There was a separate infrastructure team with their own on-call personnel who would deal with things like site outages for offices.  The nice thing was that before an end user could reach us they went through another separate team that operated 24/7 who would forward calls to the right people.  Most of the time any issue at any hour would be forwarded to the IT support team. We'd get forwarded calls about HR issues, power outages, directions for traveling, etc.  If we couldn't help them they would contact people very high up to have shit rained down on us.  The only person who saw any problem with it was our team and our immediate supervisor who would get in yelling matches with the higher UPS and basically risk his job to protect his team. He was cool, but I didn't see the situation improving and I'm sure everyone will have left that company in a year or two. I myself saw the issues with the company early, and left after only 6 months. 
Well no, probably the biggest and most obvious lie was when he said his drinking was legal during his senior year. It wasn't, and that's not the kind of thing you misremember.

Yeah, I get that and I failed to mention website support taking over for IVRs.  But, are you certain each time you call? That's my point.  With speech reco where it is now there are a lot more support options opened up than with DTMF/touchtone menus.  At the very least, the system might route you to the person best skilled to handle your issue.  If you just mash 0 every time you'll likely end up in a generic queue and actually take longer getting to the right person.  These systems are much better than they were years ago when everybody learned to loathe them.
IMO Quinn’s biggest strength is developing young guys. A lot of that comes through in-game experience i.e. learning from mistakes. Quinn is thinking these defensive players will get better over the course of the season and will be much higher quality for the play-offs. I trust his judgment on this, we just need to be in position to make the playoffs by the end of the season.
This is so obviously satire.

**DM:** Okay, so, you set up camp for the night.  **Julie:** I want to explore the area first.

Nat 20!  **DM:** Okay, so, you check out the surrounding area and you suddenly hear a rustling in a nearby bush.  **John:** Can I pee on the bush?  **Brett:** Please don't do that. There might be berries or something on it we can eat.  **DM:** There are not any berries. *But* you look around the bushes and you find a band of pixies.  **John:** The *fuck?!*  **Julie:** I wanna talk to them.  **Dana:** Yeah, they might know where to find this cavern we're searching for since *SOMEONE* used our map as toilet paper!  **Matt:** What? I had the shits, okay?  **Dana:** Yeah, from drinking all that Orc mead!  **Matt:** Still better than this shitty beer. [*crushes can and reaches for another Natty Ice*]  **Julie:** I'm talking to the pixies. What languages do they know?  **DM:** They know the common tongue.  **Julie:** Okay, so hey there, little pixies? What's up?  **DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Hi! Sorry, we hope we didn't disturb you! We're just hanging out, that's all. Don't let us bother you.  **Matt:** They're hiding something. I can smell it.  **John:** All I can smell is that nasty beer you're drinking.  **Matt:** Shut up. I wanna interrogate these pixies. [*rolls*] Boom! Eighteen, motherfucker.  **DM:** [*sighs*] All right, so Sloppy the Dwarf, you go up to the pixies and you start to interrogate them. As you do, you notice one of them is wearing armour just like yours. He's got a tiny axe and he's even drinking really shitty beer like yours.  **Matt:** Hey. Eat a dick.  **John:** I think he already did. His breath smells like balls.  **DM:** And how would you know what balls smell like?  **John:** Well, after we made out last week...  **Julie:** Okay, enough! I'm gonna ask the pixies if they wanna join us around the fire, maybe share some of the fish we caught.  **DM:** [*in high-pitched voice*] Omigod, we'd LOVE TO! We're your biggest fans!  **Dana:** Wait, wait, hold up. Fans? What?  **DM:** You heard...erm, Fingelsnark. Yeah. He said he's your biggest fan and you see that his girlfriend, Tinytits, is scribbling away furiously on a piece of parchment. In fact, several of them are carrying pieces of parchment or notebooks, plus ink and quills. A few of them are wearing armour and carrying weapons that are tiny versions of yours.  **John:** Hey, erm, whatcha...whatcha writing there, little fella?  **DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Fuck you, I'm a girl!  **John:** Fuck you, I'm a non-binary demisexual elf fighter.  **DM:** [*same higher-pitched voice*] Not according to my headcanon, you're not!  **Brett:** What? Are they writing fan-fiction about us?  **DM:** [*normal voice*] Ask the pixies.  **Brett:** Are you writing fan-fiction about us?  **DM:** [*higher-pitched voice*] Erm...no...  **Matt:** I'm stealing one of their books and reading it.  **DM:** [*normal voice*] You snatch away a tiny book that Crinkleballs is writing in and you begin to read it.  **Matt:** I'm sorry, what? What's his name?  **DM:** You try coming up with all these names! You weren't even supposed to know they were following you until you got to the cavern. Anyway, you open the book and you start to read it aloud. They have been following you for months and every night they *have been writing fan-fiction* about *ALL. OF. YOU.* And apparently they've decided that Sloppy the Dwarf and Twoflower the Elf are OTP.  **Brett:** Oh my god. No. NO!  **Julie and Dana:** BWAHAHAHAHA!  **Matt:** Well, shit. [*looks at John*] Yeah, okay, I'd totally do him.  **John:** [*shrugs in Gay*] I'm down. Let's make fan-fact.  **Dana:** Okay, no, not in front of us!  **John:** Then y'all go back to camp and me and Sloppy will perform for the pixies. [*touches Matt's cheek lovingly*] Whaddya say? Sloppy firsts?  **Matt:** [*laughs*] Yeah, all right. Should we roll a stamina check or acrobatics?  **DM:** You know what? Do both. I kinda want to see what happens.  **Julie:** I'm going to bed. Correction, Moon's going to bed.  **Brett:** I get out my camcorder so I can sell the video on DnDporn.com.  **John:** I make one of the pixies transcribe it so we can put it on r/SuddenlyGay later.  **DM:** God damn it, Matt! You're not even gay!  **Matt:** Hey! Sloppy can do whatever he wants. And right now he's doing Twoflower.  **John:** We are now bromosexuals.  **Brett:** And they say bromance is dead...

This can't be serious. Any luck?
As the saying goes, numbers don't lie. Still the best player in the league even at his advanced age. The problem is can his teammates keep up? We've all been in a situation where you're the best guy in a gym but your teammates suck and you end up losing to a team with players worse than you but better than the *rest* of your team. That sense of hopelessness is one of the most aggravating feelings in the world.

That's great, having a good relationship with her will help tremendously. Never be afraid to ask what's wrong and always ask what can be done to make it better. Don't let her feel like a burden, ever, that's a quick path to self harm and other problems.
I feel the exact same way. I just bought a PS4 to play Spiderman, and TLOU was on sale, and people are always raving about it, so I picked it up. $10, how can you go wrong?   Gameplay is fine. You just sneak around and stealth-kill zombies and people.  But I found that the only reason I find myself playing more is to progress through the story, and not to enjoy the game mechanics. For me, Spiderman nails both game mechanics and story, but that's subjective.  So the story, I'm guessing, is the reason why people love this game. But to me, it just feels so similar to all of the other zombie shows and movies that have been around for so long, that its just not that interesting to me. I'm never in a rush to get home after work to play TLOU. At this point, I'm playing just so I don't waste my $10. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game. But I think I'd rather just watch a movie about TLOU than play through it lol. 
Very sexy. Your pics were some of my favorites. Glad you’re back and hope you stay this time.

Maybe it's a cultural thing in the US (forgive me if you're not American), where people are not used to watching/playing subtitled media, but it's not that hard to read subtitles while paying attention to what's happening on the rest of the screen. You get used to it pretty quickly.

OP- Is there a way to make a shortcut that would bring the last song or last say, 5 songs, in a playlist all the way to the top of it?   Adding songs to playlists always puts them at the bottom but I always have to drag them all the way to the top. 
I'm just a madman who wants to see the #Bowsette meme continue, all it needs is another push.
40+ here. I love trash isekai. They're like Harlequins to me, just quick nothings to entertain that don't mean a thing.
I think as we are here living in our current personalities, we must enjoy what "being us" offers as much as we can. Enjoy all the things you enjoy doing as "you", and that includes sharing with our loved ones, as they probably will never look or present themselves to us the same way they are now. Maybe in another lifetimes we won't have the same affinity we have in this one. So yeah basically, in our temporal selves, we will forget each other once we are living a different life. However, the soul remembers. If you develop your spiritual abilities enough, you always can access to the memories of previous lifetimes, and relive the bonds with our most beloved souls.   Even if that's a possibility, the goal has always been live our current lifes to the fullest. I think the best way it's to live from the perspective that nothing is ever lost, even if it looks like it. Our soul will always treasure its memories and the bonds that we experienced in these time-space realities, and love will always remain.

Your assessment of the situation is very astute. I know because you conveyed exactly what I have thought many times.  It's not easy but if you have a good support group (bf and us) and are as intelligent as you sound you can do this. I know it's such a cliche but it's not that you fall it's that you get up that matters. Good luck 
If someone is asking for a service that they can't do themselves, then it's perfectly acceptable to be compensated. I'm perfectly capable of pouring a cup of coffee, but when a barista does it for me they still get paid. 
There's nothing wrong with it, but it's annoying as the person turned away. Toyota, Honda, and other car companies are in a war. They are competing with each other, and are using me as a unwitting pawn in their battle. I just want to drive a car, but just by buying one, I'm drawn into a complex battle. It feels like being a child in an acrimonious divorce. All you want is to spend time with your parents, but everything you do becomes ammo in their battle.

&gt;Don't you get it, i prefer quality over quantity.  So you just ignore the part where I say there's more critically acclaimed games on pc? Also you just mentioned Gran Turismo xD yeah maybe 10 years ago  &gt;I can't stand playing any game hunched over a desk using a computer keyboard and mouse staring at a tiny monitor,   Here's a tip, maybe grow some back muscles and dont use a $20 chair. I can sit at my desk without hunching. Also distance is a thing and a 24inch Monitor is more than enough, Infact its better than a TV in nearly all cases but single player games.

Mine's still unsolved.  A mom and two children mourning at a cemetery, rest of the movie is a sort of how we got here flashback dealing with a mad scientist who convinced the mom to hook her red hair daughter's  up to a machine that is hooked to her brain, to do something evil, mom feels remorse towards the end and stops the machine with her daughter still hooked up it, the electrical charge killing the scientist in process, leading back to the beginning.  The entire movie reads like a Lifetime movie on the 90's SciFi Channel, which might've actually aired on the 90's SciFi Channel because when it first launched and was true to its format, my mom loved watching it.

Here we are, some more photos from RoboNerd.   To summarise RoboNerd it was a small event arranged by Simon Harrison of King Buxton game, mainly as an event for people to be able to bring and display their robots, other projects such as monowheels or small bits of tech for fun like Ian Watts RC traffic cones. It was held outside a small pub so you could order some food and drinks while chatting to people at the event.  There was both a Beetle arena and an Ant arena to hold small completions throughout the day. Any parts broken off during combat would be attached to the event trophy with permission from the builder with a community vote for who deserved the trophy at the end. In the end the trophy was given to Simon himself for organising such a great event.   It was all around a great experience I would totally recommend it to any UK Battlebots/Robot Wars fans if you’re in the area.  Photo credit for a couple of these go to Simon himself, because my photos of Spectre and Limpet were terrible!  [King Buxton facebooks page.](https://www.facebook.com/KingBuxtonCombatRobot/)

Those features mentioned earlier, different engine and whatnot, different gun combos, obviously the different canopy( than the D model) I believe the canopy is the same as the B and C modes mustangs.  And I've heard, but I'm not certain on a center fuselage gas tank being another difference. Fun fact: the only difference between the B and C model mustangs are location of production! B's being California made and C's hailing from Dallas Texas.

From what I saw, the Mariners and Angels weren't convincingly good for a majority of the season. If you were to put the Athletics in a league with two 100-win teams and a 90-win team I don't think you're going to see them coming out on top.
Identical? No, what I expect is a small variance much like that between difference races, where there is far more overlap than there is distinction. To illustrate, look at the third venn diagram in [this image](http://www.mixedracestudies.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/AAAconceptions.jpg). Of course, there is no larger orange 'African' circle, because both sexes left Africa.  If we were to eventually pin down exactly how the behavior of the sexes varies naturally, I think we would find there would be a negligible difference, where e.g. men are *slightly* more likely to exhibit trait X than Y, but overall there are nearly as many women with trait X. Essentially, those differences will be more 'the exception' than 'the rule,' and there is often more variance between individuals within a single sex than between those of different sexes.  Given that every trait that could be 'typical' of one sex can be helpful to any human, and especially considering how plasticity in the human brain allows reinforcement of a behavior to become a part of a person's psyche, no behavior should be seen as 'innate' to one sex or another. Just like we don't consider any behavior to be 'innately' Asian or European, even if it happens to be more prominent on average in one than the other.   More importantly, since science (again, to my knowledge) cannot currently assign any single behavior to sex rather than culture, and because external influences like encouragement or discouragement have already been proven to have an impact on one's choices, in any given instance the argument that 'maybe it's innate' is a lazy one.

Logically what you said makes sense but this is the NFL. Where contracts mean next to nothing.   The teams don't have to honor the contracts beyond the guaranteed money and they regularly use this to fuck over players. For example if he had two years left on this contract and it wasn't guaranteed and this happened, they'd just release him and pay the minimum they were required to. Its not like the NBA where you get injured and the team still supports you.   I honestly expect a pretty nasty fight over the next CBA. The NFL is fucking messed up business-wise and its such a dangerous sport.

For what it's worth, I couldn't get into Isaac initially either (for me, on Vita). I just didn't get it. I put it aside for months, mostly forgot about it, then decided to give it another try after hearing so many good things. And for some reason, it suddenly clicked. I played for 20 hours, then bought it on PS4 as well. When it came out for Switch, I bought it there, too. Last night, in fact, I started playing again for the first time in months. I'm still playing today. I have no idea how/why the game got its hooks into me like it did, but it's a favorite (even though I'm totally grossed out by the aesthetic).  Since you're stuck with the game anyway, give it a few more runs. The magic really happens when you get a great combination of items. If you're anything like me, you'll have a run with awesome, synergistic powers, then decide you *have* to go again to see what happens next time.  :) 
Alright then buddy. Keep convincing yourself that being satisfied with mediocrity means you’re a better fan than me and anyone else who demands more of this team.
I personally believe that a psychological horror novel about the unknown would be interesting and quite terrifying. Less is often more. An unknown, looming evil that you can't see seems much more terrifying than an attacking monster you can see plainly. There's something there, it's dangerous, but you can never know what it is.

I'd say this is the least of the issues, considering the number is meaningless unless you know how long each level takes. I played MMORPGs before WoW that had a max level of 120 as well, and on top of that they had some sort of rebirth system. This made WoW look boring, having only 80 levels back then.  It's all about what you're used to after all. You could even make a thousand levels look manageable if you adjust the speed and don't have the need to buy a new spell rank each level.

&gt;Murder only applies to people. The correct term for animals is slaughter. Don't use loaded language, it devalues your arguments.  Language is always changing and exists to communicate an idea. People need to realize that killing cow has the same repercussions as killing a human, loss of life.  &gt;No, I'm in no way bothered by the slaughter of livestock.  I know you said you don't want documentaries, but if you think you aren't bothered by it, you should watch [Earthlings](http://www.nationearth.com/). It is full of undercover footage of what actually happens in slaughterhouses.  &gt;Society agrees that keeping livestock is fine, I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  Society agrees that causing unnecessary harm is wrong. Animal agriculture in the modern world is nothing but unnecessary harm.  &gt;No, because I see dogs as companions. Just beating animals for the hell of it is fucked up, as are the factory farming environments.  But you said that might makes right, so which is it? You can't have random exceptions to your moral code without some sort of doublethink.  &gt;Benevolent. But what you're doing right here is a false equivalence anyways.  How is it a false equivalence? Cows and pigs and sheep and goats and chickens can all understand their environment and feel pain and fear just like we can.   &gt;Are... Are you actually trying to argue that cows aren't a lower life form than humans? Because they most definitely are.  By what definition?  &gt;Humans don't have owners, what are you trying to say here?  Maybe I interpreted what you said wrong. I assumed "owners" could be applied similarly to any other peer.

And bulls! You could actually see all three games, as all are at Home and not overlapping. 
Yet you still live paycheck to paycheck, you're smart alright!  I work in tech as well, 6 figs is pretty average, you can make well over $100k and still be broke if you're a moron with your money.
All this anti Trump you're talking about, do all of you live on the east/west coast? Where I live people may not like Trump but they won't shun you or attack you. But liberals and the left always have some crazy agenda to push.
All right, just been a little behind the curve and unsure where I might be lacking so good to know, also definitely am under estimating co-op especially right now.
You gave me a craving i didnt know could exist. Shit
Which, it is important to add, is not always a bad thing. For example, him choosing not to take his debilitating, zombifying meds.
My heart started racing when I read "Alien: Isolation sequel confirmed as Aliens: Resistance" and then dropped tremendously when I finished reading the sentence.  This was the single fastest tonal shift I've ever experienced next to "Geno is announced for Super Smash Bros WiiU" finishing with "as a Mii Fighter costume."
But the only lol person that gets that many viewers is bjergsen the rest of them hardly get anything  not even a quarter of what he gets  Edit: People seem to think im talking about all  the LoL streamers im referring only to tsm LoL pro players that stream they hardly get views compared to bjersen and their chat actually reflects how many viewers they have

The founderpack items have not even been given out.. u can just make a new character with the name u want and get the founderpack items. Keep in mind; the founderpack items will be sent to the first char you login with(not counting mushking fyi), so make sure u don't login with your other char.  Also, u'll be able to transfer them to an alt on the same server through storage

You should check out honkai impact 3rd. its not the most FTP friendly game out there but its still pretty decent in that regards. high quality visuals, lots of depth in character mechanics and skill interactions and fast paced combat. Also story is pretty interesting in the later chapters and events. The majority of characters can be farmed.  As for dragalia lost it's hard to tell where things will go from here. the game is still brand new. I havent rolled at all in this game aside from my initial starting 2. I'm extremely wary of the possibility (basically inevitable) of powercreep. Because they'll need to add something drastically new to the game every now and then so we dont lose interest.   As it is now gameplay wise each character is just X attribute + X weapon style. Leaving only skills and some stats/passives left to make characters really feel unique gameplay wise. So it'll take until the next major update to really get an idea of what their designs will be like for the future.
You must be so fun at parties.

EFTPOS minimums are against the issuing banks' ToS (terms of service) and are NOT enforceable. In fact, if a shopkeeper will not allow you to put your purchase - however small - through on EFTPOS you can always contact their bank and make a complaint (I mean, *if* you're that sort of person, which you really shouldn't be).
Oh you can find plenty of places where that's a popular opinion.  If you are going to seriously talk about "reddits left wing propaganda", I'm willing to bet you are already aquainted with communities what that view is very popular.  Regardless, even if its mis/over-used, it doesn't mean "misogyny" has lost its meaning.  Still means what it has always means and it probably used correctly most of the time even.

That guys don't wanna eat pussy I find strange, but okay. Not wanting to touch it is ridiculous.. But him not letting you touch your own pussy? Insane. Couldn't believe what I was reading. So glad you dumped him. Don't let him fool you, vaginas aren't disgusting, it, and the 'slimy' part are sexy as hell. You're beautiful and if he convinced you otherwise, drop that. 
Sure that's fair, a blatant break of the rules should be removed.

No it was from a porno I was watching the other day..😋

This isn’t related to what I’m saying. I am pretty sure you may have replied to the wrong comment. My point is that Kanye can disagree with trump on an issue (in this case the validity of for profit prisons) and still support him. If you meant that Kanye can’t support Trump because of his stance on police brutality, my point still applies. Kanye is a trump supporter, wether that be for publicity or if it is what he really feels in his heart. If you wanna change his mind, DM him. I’m not a trump supporter, I don’t know why you’re telling me these things.
maybe sometime that i can't remember, but typically, those would be defended on either the b-shows of the tour (with the road tos being the c-shows) or on the undercard of an a-show. the only title defenses i remember happening on road to shows are for the jr tag titles and the never trios titles.

Cant agree more.  I have 48 disks spinning and I could knock it down to 24 if I upgraded 12 to 8TB and the savings in electricity would pretty much make the drives free over the years they will last.  Started with a 12x500GB array around 2007/2008.  Eventually upgraded to 12x2TB drives.  Now I have 12x8TB drives.  Problem is the 12x2TB drives still work fine so I just added a second array - and half of the 10yr old 500GB drives still work too so I have them in a JBOD case for torrents to see how long they last - friend gave me a bunch of random 1-2TB drives from SSD upgrades on oem systems I also have in the JBOD.  Plus I have 6 4TB drives I purchased when I was going to do a 12x4 array before I discovered the 8tb easystores.  Probably should have just sold the 2&amp;4TB drives while they were still worth something.  Might still be worth selling and reinvesting in 8tb drives.  10w x 24/7 is $11.5 a year where I live.  So ~6 years is $70 in electricity. So if 4TB drives cost $45, but a 8TB drive costs $160 seems like 4TB is way cheaper per GB but when you add in the electricity for 6 years the price is the same + half the bays and less waste(poor planet).  Or if you do the above with 2TB drives.  4x 2TB drives that are FREE cost more then a $160 8TB after less then 5 years.  Yep in the long run $160 8TB drives are cheaper then FREE 2tb drives.
That is the only one I have a dupe of and I use the others sorry. Try /r/lowtiertradingrl . Most people on here don't pay attention to low value iteme

Obviously more so than I and we likely spend it differently. I only have the Missouri and Nelson. But in the short time since they introduced coal, I'm almost to the Musashi and more than halfway to Salem. Though I have a DM but not a Yamato. Helps that the coal price is cheaper and one doesn't need to stack multiple flags and so on to get a decent amount with minimal play.

I know exactly what you mean, after owning and playing the game for almost a month straight all of a sudden my account got deleted because Xsolla's system wrongfully detected my purchase as canceled, now ive been out of my game for almost a week and they just emailed me saying my purchase was mistakenly canceled by their system and they are going to give me a $10 coupon so I can buy the game again, but who is to say the same thing wont happen again when I re-purchase the game?  
Really? because people in the middle ages believed in dragons, wizards, etc but women warriors weren't common at all. Yes, Joan of Arc was a commander, there were other women warriors, they weren't common, you can cherrypick all you want.

You have a very contemptuous view of womens' abilities. There are plenty of sports, such as gymnastics and skijumping, where women do better. It's just that these sports have not been given the same recognition by a male-dominated audience.

'Might not', not that he isn't and Toriyama also said that Goku is a good person who is hopeless when it comes to fighting.   And how are these scenes show Goku being manipulative? The first one isn't Goku being manipulative, he's just lying Him telling Gohan not to worry isn't being manipulative. And that last one is having Goku having two goals for Uub. He said the exact same thing about Piccolo Jr.

Thanks for this well thought out feedback, I'll respond point-by-point.  1. I am trying to avoid large CPU heatsinks but I will definitely consider this, as well as do more research on the current choice that I have.  2. Will there really be much of a noticeable difference compared to the G.Skill Ripjaws V in my current list for the price? 3. Sounds good to me, I'm not picky about the SATA drive. 4. This one I am still wrestling with... I agree that the 1080ti is the logical choice, but the "treat yourself" attitude I'm taking towards this build has me leaning towards the 2080, even if it's irrational. Perhaps I should consider this in regards to point #2.  5. I will definitely consider this over the current case I have selected. 6. Thanks a lot for this, I wasn't aware. Will definitely make this change. 7. I'm not huge on mechanical keyboards. I had one for work (I'm a programmer) and wasn't a fan. Maybe for gaming it'll be different, but that'll be something to consider down the line :)

Last time I tried X-scape it worked okay but the sound was extremely stuttery. Also, if I remember correctly DSiWare requires a bit of setup: I think just changing CPU speed and memory in settings to match DSi? Not so sure on the details since it's been a while.
I looked at your site, I think it's pretty quick actually.  Maybe you are testing it incorrectly? There are other plugins that will tell you what plugins may be running slow.  Also yes, cloudflare is free so use that.  Also it may be measuring it from a unloaded state.  If your site isn't used for a period of time it kind of goes to sleep for the first load.  You can usually solve this by implementing a monitoring tool that pings your site every 15 minutes or so.  If I were you, I'd do everything above.  I'd also set up a new site on that host or disable all your plugins for a minute and test.  If it's still slow you know you won't be able to do anything further on your side.  If it's fast, you can figure out what plugins are slowing things down.

DLC has completely killed my desire to buy fighting games at launch, knowing that I'm not going to be getting the entire game out of the gate. It's either pay the price for the new character when they come out, or not be able to get in practice time dealing with that character at all. So my solution is just to either buy the game once all the DLC is already out or just skip the game entirely.
I agree with you, and I think that's the only reasonable stance.    Garbage human with insane talent. They're a dime a dozen in sports.

Pretty hard to rate a trade one year after it has happened. We're still debating the Judd trade on the Eagles board but on paper we traded Judd for Kennedy and Masten, which is now an easy win to us. I think it goes deeper than that because Judd's leadership was invaluable to Carlton and he's given them three chances at a father-son in the future (though Oscar was decked out in Eagles gear the other day....)

I second that, this book is a pleasure to read.
&gt; where I feel people (locals) make a point to not stare.   People in US (outside NYC) have a warped idea of what a stare means.  A stare means intensely observing someone with focussed attention to the point of making them uncomfortable.  In US, especially small towns, a simply "resting face" is interpreted as a stare. Unless you have a smile plastered on your face like Joker or keep head nodding at everyone , people think you are staring at them.  Which is why people in US think Germans and Russians "stare" at people. They don't. That is simply the normal expressionless face, since there is no obligation to smile or head-nod at every stranger the street.
Same analogy as learning language from a native vs a non-native person

Doordash will give us multiple orders at once. I’ve had up to 4 orders before. 2 from one restaurant, and 2 from the restaurant a few doors down. Stacking orders is really the only way to get decent pay sometimes since doordash lowers what they pay us based on your tip. The only time I decline stacked orders if I get a stacked order from a restaurant I know is slow and is always running behind.

This is what I haven't seen yet that is really making me question a lot of the Catholic Church's statements about the whole issue. There is a lot of "sadness" but no "anger" and certainly no "actions." I don't think that they can keep people from leaving if they don't start making productive actions and taking responsibility for the past.

I had a local church send me a ton of spam when I moved once. I collected about 20 envelops and walked into the church in the middle of service on a Sunday morning, walked straight up to the podium, interrupted the guy giving his sermon and said “you left this shit in my mailbox”. They stopped pretty fucking fast.

And some honestly pretty good tunes to her name.   I'll say quite openly, [Jolene](https://youtu.be/L0eeSoU35wM) and [Nine to Five](https://youtu.be/UbxUSsFXYo4) are absolute classics.   She's also got some great non-musical lines.  &gt;Other famous Dolly-isms include “It costs a lot of money to look this cheap” and “I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb... and I also know that I'm not blonde.”  And as I randomly just found whilst looking for those quotes, a take on the Trans bathrooms issue I can get behind.  &gt;“I think everybody should be treated with respect. I don't judge people. I try not to get too caught up in all the controversy of things. I hope that everybody gets a chance to be who and what they are. I just know if I have to pee I'm gonna pee. I don't care where it's gonna be.”

But he also can't claim innocence. 
Hes missing like 1 discipline on his quiver.  Otherwise hes got the most he can get.  Idk how the extra 100% damage modifier applies or if goofed by not rerolling it over the stat he chose.  (responding to OP now)  The rings are kinda rough.  I have not really seen people pushing 100s with UE multi.  Like if you check the leaderboards there are people up there but they probably have a bit better gear than you and also know how to play the rifts really well (when to stop and fight vs skip)  I have somewhat comparable gear to you and I am somewhat stuck around the same rough rift level.  I don't think you're going to snap your fingers and do 20 GR level higher.  If you want to climb higher maybe consider trying impale or the nat/mar sentry hybrid.

So sorry, I'm just selling for now :( As you can see from this post, I have way too much product as is 😅
could you please explain a little more? i’m not certain i understand.
I don't think anyone has a problem with that particular call.  It's all the other bullshit that happened before that's an issue

I feel that. I'm a younger guy myself (18) but I feel  like I definitely relate to your POV. I grew up listening to a lot of classic stuff and remember being very turned off by the new wave as it blew up. I remember early high school i got super into Atmosphere, some Cunninlynguists, furthered my already massive love for Eminem and some other "backpack rap" if you will. I didn't understand why everyone I knew didnt like the shit that I liked. In hindsight I probably was probably pretty cringey lol. But I eventually just learned to accept the stuff around me. Still not exactly what I choose to listen to but it'll always be here

that could be true, we'll have to find out when we start seeing him against nba teams. i tend to disagree with that idea because he wqs effectigely last year in limited action in the regular season. playoffs was a different story, he clearly wasnt ready which any reasonable fan can understand as he was a rookie who played 15 games. but like i said we'll see how he looks. i see youve already made up your mind on the subject though so im not really gonna be checking back for your opinion since biased opinions are meaningless

I haven't heard of that either but if you have the source I can give it a read and tell you what it's worth. Metal vapourization is definitely possible in the right conditions (it's actually a processing technique commonly used to coat parts with a thin metallic layer), but these conditions are usually met on purpose.

I walk out on one of my old job at a retail.  The team lead was a Hispanic guy who barely spoke English, I was stacking some merchandise on the shelves and he come over and told to take care of the trash and started to stack everything in the wrong place and told me hey you are putting the stuff in wrong place.  And goes in his broken English I am boss and listen to me only.  After I finish with the trash and I was leave and he had f\*\*king put everything in the wrong place and was trying to get me to help him and I said No, and in his broken English I am boss, and I stop him and told him to F\*\*K himself and I told him I quit and throw my bag at him and left.  He glad my arm and try to stop me and I turn around and shoved his fat ass into the shelves and told him.  Don't you dare touch me again or I will call the cops on you for assault, and left the building.  About a month later I was able to find another job that did the same thing but pay a lot better.

I realized it’s not the point of your post, but I wanted to say thanks for not trying to shift some of the blame.   I’ve been in your husband’s place (albeit not married), and had her push the blame towards me (“I wouldn’t feel so fat if you weren’t so skinny!”) and it’s just awful.   Good for you, and I hope despite the troubles you still feel as beautiful as he thinks you are!

Because Redpath manufactures sugar but not salt, and Windsor manufactures salt but not sugar. So if they got things confused, there must be something seriously wrong. Sunbec probably uses the same equipment to package both products, which means this is probably just a factory error.
I've tried online dating and I find no one attractive or interesting. My ex is far from perfect but he's all I want. I also feel this sick need to move on before he does even though I have zero interest in dating. The idea of building that connection from the ground up terrifies and exhausts me. He's ruined all men for me.

Yeah, this week will be a test. I was absolutely expecting us to be ranked because it's hard to exclude a 4-0 team when so many others have been screwing up or having bad losses, but at the same time it doesn't mean a whole lot to me until we back it up against a real team.

Tsavorite garnet is emerald green, and more durable than emerald.  Emerald tends to have internal fractures, look up emerald "oiling".  Another green garnet species is dementoid.  It is light green, tends to have inclusions, but it has an incredible amount of rainbow dispersion, more than diamond.  Tourmaline is found in every color, and on paper it is durable as tsavorite in terms of hardness, but talk to a bench jeweler,  it is a little fragile for a ring worn every single day.
Somebody shoot join or something!
Now we need a good O-line to protect Rosen. A bunch of good WR's (I would keep Kirk), we need a solid TE when Gresham retires. We also need to revamp the entire Defense and hire a new kicker. Aside from all that we are doing great.

&gt; We are created perfect,  Do you have a verse to support that?  &gt; children cannot sin.   Or that?  &gt; We have no sin until we can willfully sin with full knowledge of our actions and their consequence.  Or that?  &gt; Jesus said to become like little children, because such was the kingdom of God. IE children have no sin.  So when Jesus said "Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it” you took that to mean "You do not have a sinful nature", and not, as most scholars agree, that we are to be humble, teachable, open, and innocent as we accept his sacrifice and teachings?

We use AWS for everything, but were a long time Oracle customer.  Oracle cloud team calls me all the time to try and get us to switch, their sales staff sounds depressed, they have no good reason for anyone to switch.  But we have a single product that uses oracle cloud and wow, I get a ton of outage notifications on it.  I feel sorry for anyone using Oracle cloud for actual production workloads, their lives must be hell.
If it's that nice, I'd probably notice too. I'd probably even say, wow, she had a nice butt.

\&gt; It's just been making me confused why the medical institutions don't write CPAP prescriptions with more expedience.   I think the delays are just because there aren't enough slots in sleep labs to meet demand, so they're booked up pretty far in advance.  There's no reasoning behind the delays - it's just that our healthcare system is a trainwreck.  \&gt; Are there extreme risks involved in CPAP therapy that outweigh continued sleep issues?  No.  On the contrary, people sometimes die in their sleep from untreated OSA.

Ah, but the ending of it is awesome.   [](#s "After being homeless for a time and bouncing around foster homes and shelters, Peter decides to use his powers to break Uncle Ben out of prison. But Ben stops him and explains how he's doing his time to protect Peter, and how as his uncle, that's his responsibility. Peter finally accepts this and realizes he's been a world-class asshole, and decides to dedicate his time toward being a better person. It ends with Uncle Ben getting released on good behavior, and he works with his nephew by essentially becoming the Alfred to Peter's Batman, aiding him in fighting crime.")

&gt; If those issues weren’t enough to cause people to question the legitimacy of Wormhole, a phrase hidden in the project’s white paper is the nail in the coffin. Developers acknowledge, in black and white, that they want to be able to manipulate the network. The white paper reads, “In the future, if any methods be used to create the private key of this address – the BCH protocol might prohibit coins in this address from being transferred.”  &gt; This shows that the developers are not thinking decentralization—the heart of cryptocurrency—and are fully prepared to wield their power over the network. They have also coded Wormhole to allow them to assert their control on a whim.  &gt; Elsewhere in the white paper, Wormhole developers make the claim that Wormhole can provide greater decentralization and independent outputs. However, given the fact that they have coded Wormhole to be able to control the network, where exactly is the decentralization?
I would've made her skimpier but that would've been too much 
Yeah? I played the game from start to finish when it launched, so you're going have to explain to me what parts I'm wrong about.
Not sure why you’re being downvoted dude makes $11mill a year(yeah obviously not this year) and never hustles it’s extremely aggravating, yes there is an injury risk to sprinting out routine plays but ffs you also want to be a leader and set an example for younger guys.

Turn around. Grab your coat. And go home. You saw nothing... 
Sometimes people are just obnoxious though. I have absurdly skinny wrists thanks to genetics, which makes me look tiny regardless of the fact that a still have an average waist and thighs and whatnot. My (overweight) co-worker said to me "Have you thought about eating more? Cause you're freaking tiny" ughhh I was so shocked I couldn't respond but then stewed on it all day 
You gonna ignore that they overturned the browns 1st with 1:42 that led to OT in the first place?

It's not costly because the accusations have no proof. And it's not a win-win when we have the supreme court majority. Can't destroy America when you won't get past the Supreme Court. Must be depressing.
Why do you automatically think it's Eli's fault. He had some good throws... Maybe it's the O-line, maybe it's our playmakers not making plays, maybe it's the gameplan... Or maybe it's a bit of everything

This is why people running 2e tournaments baffles me. We dont have tournament rules yet to even run them. 
Reading these responses I guess I’m just a slacker haha. I just do what I can with what I have and don’t stress the rest.   I study when I can. I have a full time job. A kid/family/house duties/husband stuff/son helping their parents/etc.   I study when I have time. I do my assignments.   I was hitting it hard at first but realized I was not giving my life or other things attention. My kid wanted to play and I said no about 5 times in a two hour period. I don’t want to be that dad. So I adjusted my study habits.   So far still 90s. I just put a lot more concentration in when I study now.   Don’t get me wrong. I feel overwhelmed at times but eh.   The BIGGEST thing is make time for yourself but “experiencing life” ....THIS IS IT! haha. Don’t compare yourself to others. Compare yourself to yesterday.   Sacrifice now so later you will reap the rewards. Edit. About the stress. Address that shit ASAP. Find your outlet. Mediate. Lift heavy weights. Run. Write. Read. Listen to a book. FIND something. Stress (the bad kind, what you have) is terrible for you and your body it does you no good. I know it’s easier said then done but I promise once you find that balance you’ll live a happier life. 
Tu falou que o cara é louco, mesmo se ele for trouxa de aceitar calado você o criticou.
Vanilla feeling of reaching Stranglethorn Vale, and leveling within it. It seemed so huge and adventurous, much more densely packed than the zones I leveled in so far, with a new quest or a dangerous group of enemies around every corner. Everyone was leveling back then, so zones with a wide level range and a huge number of quests like Stranglethorn ended up being a mini-Barrens, which I didn't experience because I was playing Alliance, so it felt very social and immersive on that front too.  Of course the best days were when the first honor system hit right as I was still questing in the zone...

Would be cool if opponents army is bigger than yours, his champion\`s hp would be larger. And would be cool if there can be technological upgrades to make your fighter stronger or give him extra moves.
Thank you for this! Always great to learn things like this. ☺
However it’s funded, my point is that this particular comment on this particular post was probably genuinely well-intentioned. 
What is your reaction going to be when he is confirmed next week ?
Get a ruck. Buy some boots. Fill the ruck up and walk. Start with 1 mile with no less than 36 lbs.  work up to the point so you can do 12 Miles.   Sprints.should be able to carry your body weight +20-30 lbs for a minimum of 100m   Grappling. Find someone better than you and train for an hour if you can.   Weight lifting.  Your not going to gain muscle in basic if you go in looking like a body builder. You’re going to lose it all.  High rep moderate weight. Don’t kill yourself but get use to being sore af all the time.   Sleep.  You’re not going to get much. And it’ll be intermittent.   You’ll be fine even if you don’t do any of the above things,  just keep your mental health good and have a support system. 
sounds like its bath time!

If you havent already seen my or others answers;  His teammate (Lewis Hamilton) is currently leading the drivers championship battle and was one position and a couple of seconds ahead of his nearest rival (Sebastian Vettel). Mercedes felt Hamilton would be under pressure from Vettel due to rear-tyre wear and used Bottas as a buffer to both protect and extend his championship lead. ( Credz to u/Jam-Master-Jay for a much simpler and better explanation than I have! )

Amazing, right? [I believe this is the source of the data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/obesity_adult_15_16/obesity_adult_15_16.htm) and here is the lead-in to the report.   “Results from the 2015–2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), using measured heights and weights, indicate that an estimated 39.8% of U.S. adults aged 20 and over have obesity, including 7.6% with severe obesity, and another 31.8% are overweight. Body mass index (BMI), expressed as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), is commonly used to classify overweight (BMI 25.0–29.9), obesity (BMI at or above 30.0), and severe obesity (BMI at or above 40.0).”

"You are going to experience the most intense ritual you'll ever encounter in your masonic career. When I went through it, my heart was pounding the entire time. It was so emotionally intense that when the ritual came to a climax, it felt like my brain was on fire and my spine was wired with electricity. After it's over, you'll be part of a group of masons that is highly involved at all levels, and insanely dedicated to the Craft. It is the most exhausting masonic body you'll ever be in, and you'll love every second of it."
What resolution do you use? If you use 16:9 and have been using it for a few years, I want you to try using 4:3 stretched for a while and see if you are able to make the change because that’s the reason Professionals don’t change. Like I said, even Device said he tried switching but couldn’t. It’s like relearning CS from the ground up.  There’s a reason pro’s hardly ever switch the way they play. Only recently did flusha get rid of his Microsoft mouse from over 10 years ago and if you haven’t noticed, he definitely hasn’t gotten any better.  Also, Bigger playermodels? Nah, worthless. Who cares about being able to make something easier to aim at?

Nah. The valedictorian at my school was a trouble maker big time. But she was like a chaotic good trouble maker. Always protesting and making a fuss over injustices and shit. She also only came to school three days out of the week just to prove that she could make straight A's without even showing up. And her speech at graduation was basically just calling out our small southern town for being backward. She then finished her speech with a prayer...in Arabic...from the Koran...in the Deep South. She was raised Muslim but agnostic, pretty sure she was literally just trolling at that point.

I'm 26 and same. Her music is so mature, it amazes me she has such young dedicated fans. My mom would have popped a blood vessel if she heard me listening to Ari at 15 lol.
Same, it’s tough to know what’ll happen.  Cheadle’s been in the MCU for 8-9 years already, Sebastian Stan for 7-8, and Anthony Mackie for 4-5; so it’d make the most sense for Mackie to take over; but Stan has like 6 more pictures in his deal or something.  Cheadle you’d think would be done but hey maybe he’s excited to take over as Iron Man (if that’s what’ll happen)  Who’s to say, y’know?

I've seen one but I can't vouch for reliability.
&gt; Agree Logan is better then everything the MCU has done or will ever due.  I personally disagree. I think Civil War and Infinity War can rival that movie in terms of characters, story, and overall writing, but I still think Logan is a really good movie.
Like making him the highest paid safety in the league 4 years ago? By taking Earl in the 1st round? Poor Earl, after publicly saying he wants to be a Cowboy, the Seahawks FO didn't extend him. What a bunch of assholes am I right?

FYI it's extremely common for books to be printed vertically, from right to left in Taiwan. Items that are usually printed horizontally, left to right include:  * Textbooks * Most magazines * Websites * Workplace/government documents * Most road signs (but not all) * Most printed menus (however large signboards menus are often vertically oriented)  Text on monuments, historical markers, and in temples are often printed vertically, right to left (including the inscription above the temple). As for business signs and text on vehicles: I've seen every possible orientation imaginable.   To your original question: when handwriting most Taiwanese will write horizontally, left to right. It's not unusual to see vertically oriented handwriting on envelopes and sometimes on postcards, depending on the size/shape of the postcard.

You're actually correct.  I'm a commercial plumber and that part is called a bubbler from the factory.
Maybe later on, but my tractors barely broken in, so I don't think it needs it. 
I had not considered this, but honestly, yeah, they should just replace Metzen. Metzen will always be the voice of Thrall, but it's pretty abysmal that Blizz is willing to cut out Thrall of all people just because the voice actor can't make it.  If they can find someone who sounds close enough, it'll be fine. I mean we haven't even heard Thrall speak for fucking years. Not a lot, anyway.

He's accused of sexual assault. There's two reasons he's accused. Either he's a sexual assaulter or there's a conspiracy in which multiple women have come forward to discredit him to push forward the liberal agenda. What seems more likely to you? I'ma Occams Razor this and say it's more likely he preyed on women. 
Also, when you see the killcam, it’s not actually what happened. It’s what your client assumed happened given its information, but the server might have seen something different. In other words, if the server saw you being in the open when mccree fired, you’ll die. The kill cam doesn’t know that though, and it only recreates what happened from the other perspective, but using your ping.

All good points  Regarding neck gaiters, I usually just pull mine over my chin to the bottom of my lower lip.  If you pull it over your mouth, condensation makes it damp or on awful cases frosts on the outside.  If you pull it up over your nose and you're wearing glasses, your breath gets funneled up under your glasses and also frosts  Layers are your friend, but don't overdo it.  You should be borderline uncomfortable chilly when you leave.  If you're comfortable and toasty when you set out you'll start sweating and you don't want to do that.  Do not cheap out on gloves or shoe covers.  Get the good shit  Your bike will act and feel different in cold conditions.  A lively steel frame will feel like a hi-ten tank  Water will freeze in your bidons less quickly if you put a shot of whiskey in them.  If you're headed to work this is probably not a good idea

It is a premise of *your* argument. That does not make what I said a non sequitur, especially since much of what I said was in response to other issues, and you have not addressed those issues.   If you want to claim that if God doesn't exist, reason is not justified, that makes your argument valid, but at the cost now not being the least bit sound. You now have to support your claim of Premise 2 ... and from what I have seen how presuppositionalists argue, that is done by denying the consequent from Premise 1. Now, if you want to argue that I'm lying, and I've never seen presuppositionalists make an argument along those lines, then perhaps we should get the moderators involved. Otherwise, I think you owe me an apology for calling my post a "non-sequitur".  Your argument only needs premise one and three; premise two and conclusion one are superfluous. It's a bit odd to include superfluous premises in your argument, and then claim it's a "non-sequitur" when someone points out that relying on those premises would be a fallacy. If there's a non sequitur, it's including Premise 1 in the first place, if you don't plan on relying on it.
Badass!
Thank you. 
I just read this today as I was coloring my hair. Red is my go to fall happy look. I feel at my most powerful with red hair.

Bom, esse é um jeito de definir a esquerda e a direita... Mas se você colocar a esquerda como oposição ao status quo, todo regime autoritário - que é definido por perseguir sua oposição - vai ser anti-esquerda.  Mas essa definição é mais útil numa discussão histórica do que política.   O Liberalismo pode ser esquerda dependendo do contexto histórico, por exemplo. Afinal, foi um dos motores ideológicos de muitas revoluções no ocidente, com seu maior exemplo na França.   Não acho prático definir esquerda dessa maneira, no contexto político atual. Dá a entender que ideologias que hoje estão colocadas à direita são alheias à repressão ou quebra de paradigmas.  O autoritarismo sempre persegue vozes opostas, venham ela de qualquer canto do espectro político.

I probably over simplified...for your taste...but you said exactly the same thing I said.  If you went to hell for sin you would as you said you are guilty of gluttony.  The game was changed, so to speak, with God's sacrifice of his son. Because we are all sinners, as I stated and this will never change.   So the price for going to heaven is giving your life to Jesus.   And the verse can easily be interpreted as "we are all destined for hell, but giving your life to Jesus is the key to heaven...not sinlessness."  I appreciate your down vote because I wasn't verbose enough for you. I hope this helps.
