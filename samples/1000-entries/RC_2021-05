I had the same problem with older bulldozer amd cpus. I had to reinstall windows several times. I think it was the motherboard because I exchanged cpus several times and had the same problem. Initially it would not overheat for the beginning of install. But when I started installing stuff it would start overheating again. Maybe try parted magic to see if it is overheating.

I'm so glad you got shots and are keeping yourself safe. It's such a relief to know you won't be hospitalized or suffer the long term effects, much less die.   Love that dress.

MVIS is an incredible R&amp;D company... but for 15 years they have operated in Woz fashion as compared to Jobs. All about developing amazing tech but little effort to reach all potential customer and investors. This leaves us more vulnerable to manipulation.  Case in point LAZR market cap is much higher and less volatile and they have all sorts of attention from automotive industry. Much of our potential market cap is in the bank accounts of Shorts and Swing traders.

That I'm fat and lazy, even when I played sports, hung out with people and sometimes walked or ran home at night. Also I was not fat I was a 12 to 14 UK size, and not short. I quit rugby because they'd say I may aswell give it up if I wasn't going to try. I played for fun my family ruined that for me, my friend played to become a national player and did. She was always thier model daughter they couldn't have.  I left home at 16, and haven't played rugby since then either for many reasons, but mostly because of them. I have quite bad mental health issues though so it's partly down to that ig

I'm not trying to be difficult but there is a very real probability here that someone could be charged with rape and sent to prison for a condom found on the bed post sex.  It happened to me many times as a young man and was extremely upsetting for both parties at the time. I was honestly accused with "how could you not feel it" - as though it were only me who had feeling in their genitals.   There was serious anger and rage - which I can understand.

Flee is the wrong way to look at it.  Several Brigade and lesser formations were ordered to basically retreat to Saudi Arabia.  This was a sensible action given that many units did not have time to upload full ammo/water/food/fuel loads, and it was doubtful the Kuwaiti forces could stage a cohesive resistance by the time most forces had been alerted.  The thought process was instead of expending these forces in pointless at that point counter attacks, that they would go west, link up with the Saudis for whatever happened next.  Kuwait had historically been  supported against Iraq by much of the Middle East, so the Kuwaitis rightly assumed their forces would be of use to whatever force went back into Kuwait to kick the Iraqis out.   While some Kuwaiti units would be forced to surrender (The Kuwaiti Navy for instance, was more or less captured at anchor) a reasonable amount would find its way as part of JFC-N (Egyptian/Saudi/Kuwaiti/Syrian forces) or JFC-E (Mostly Saudi, with Kuwaiti, Omani, Emirate and other forces)

Welcome to Raider Nation Trevon Moehrig!
I had some wicked uneven-ness on the IHS for my 3950x, it was so bad it caused a 10-25c variation in temp and bad spikes before getting under control, IN ADDITION, was literally biting into 3 corners of the plate on my heatsinks and water blocks.  SOOO since AMD was constantly out of stock and it took too long for them to get back to me, I sanded the corners down (after talking with someone who said as long as the printing on the face was still readable with Part number/serial number, warranty is still valid) and after doing so.... BOOM, temps dropped   Not saying it WAS your issue, and NOT SAYING TO DO THIS (especially since AMD can say oh, nope, still warranty void because its not putting huge divots in your heatsinks anymore...), but, I had done it before with Intel, and didnt want to deal with no CPU for a time, and glad I did, solved my issue.  I would be interested in before/after RMA analysis for these situations.  What I WOULD say to do for others with temp issues, is pull the heatsink off when next a chance presents and look closely at the IHS top and the heatsink/coldplate you put on it to see if you have any bad spots where it doesnt look like contact is made.
I don‚Äôt even know all the details anymore.  That‚Äôs why we leave it up to our web team.

24, in the north pole, has no sand, and no scrap, so you cant make your own silicon, and whitout silicon you cant make surge alloy. Also, without sand, you cant make blast compound nor pyrite, so you gotta relly heavily in nuclear power, which is either cumbersome if you use RTG, or very vulnerable to attacks if you use nuclear reactors. This means you gotta basically relly on imported materials, which isnt really bad, but being an Anihilation level, waves are heavy as heck. Overall, a hard experience for me, I have already lost 3 cores there.
if someone is struggling I'll just help, I won't normally ask cos they need help and its embarrassing to admit you need help sometimes.If they aren't struggling they can just get in with it fine. this may be an English thing, as I'd probably die before asking for help but be glad if someone did.  I imagine a lot of countries dont have this problem with over executed manners.
Yes, I have a spreadsheet that‚Äôs uses 3 sheets (plus a graphing sheet) per financial year. Sheet one is just the general debit card account for petty cash purchasing, sheet 2 is the budget so I have a line of what I want to be putting away each week then under it what I do put away, which then feeds into the 3rd page which is the savings account (will one day be an offset when I get around to buying a house) which is split into various ‚Äúsub funds‚Äù some for bills, others saving goals etc  Been doing that for about 7 years now and still have the first years system as part of the same spreadsheet, the system has improved drastically over the years XD  Excel is a beautiful system for finance record keeping!

The 72 pack of Derwent pencils was the ultimate status symbol in school.   I still remember the name of the first kid who brought a set to school, and she won a drawing competition for tracing over a picture from one of her colouring packs onto new paper, then colouring it in, and it felt so unfair when she won against everybody else who had actually drawn their entries from scratch. She never let anybody else use the pencils to colour in for fear we would break them.

&gt; If after a year she decided a proportionate split would be better, that‚Äôs not a conversation you get to just shut down.   OF COURSE she decided that a proportionate split would be better, because it benefits her.  A proportional split makes sense if one party is interested in a lifestyle that the other has no interest in and cannot afford.  In this case, she would be living somewhere with a roommate anyways and paying that rent anyways.  It would be a nice thing for him to do to agree to a proportional split of rent, but it's not a *fair* thing to do, it's a *generous* thing to do.  GF is paying 25% of her income toward rent and is able to save 33% of her income, it's not like she's living below the poverty line.  If she wants to save more of her income, she can start working toward a field with a higher income potential...

Aleister's ult can be dodged too - just don't be a sitting duck and you're fine. With Arum you just need to stay out of range.
She should consider going after Governor Kemp for his seat and have a rematch. Why? Because it  help not only her, but will make sure fellow Dem and Senator Warnock get another term.
I'm not married so take what I say with the biggest grain of salt. But I think you keeping it a secret would do more harm that discussing it openly with her. Because for her, that would mean that you do not trust her, or she won't trust you.  Married couples will probably preach that the secret to a healthy marriage is communicating, and compromising. Putting the well-being of your partner above all else. This goes both ways however.  So with that in mind, consider what might go through the head of your partner at the mention of a sex doll. She may interpret that as you're getting tired of the same old sex (assuming you're active), or perhaps you want to spice things up and would like to explore this WITH her. At least it's not with another woman right?

Kinda messed up on how she tried to manipulate him into not using protection
He keeps splitting the armpits/shoulders... the body-build/training they have him doing means his muscles are constantly changing...   They try to alter the suits to accommodate the changes but he still averages one ‚Äúbreakout‚Äù per episode (often it‚Äôs his pants due to his growing leg muscles, but he‚Äôs busted out of his jackets pretty often as well).
This is gorgeous!
Yeah, because it's a single-player game. There's no benefit to the player in requiring it to be online because most people couldn't care less if someone is cheating in a single-player video game. Plus, online-only raises the question of whether or not it's worthwhile to essentially put an expiration date on a game (i.e. whenever the servers get shut down by Sony in the future) for such a negligible reason.  In regards to PR, I think that most people would be more put off by A) reports that the game doesn't allow for mid-run saves than they would be by B) reports that a small fraction of the player base of this single-player game are abusing the old reliable "Close game, upload to cloud, reopen game, die, download to PS5, die, download to PS5, die, download to PS5‚Ä¶" exploit to get through the game without any deaths on their stat tracker.

That's good to hear. Halo 5 wasn't amazing imo, but dropping plot lines is never good. Infinite seems to be a big enough game where, if they want to, they could wrap up that story and still begin a new one.  We'll just have to wait and see what's happening once story trailers come out, but the lack of connections to the rest of the Reclaimer Saga in what we've seen so far is curious.

People that refuse to get vaccinated voluntarily are higher risk, therefore should pay higher medical insurance premiums than vaccinated people.  It costs $$$ to pay for people who come down with Covid and to think they just simply refused to help reduce the risk of a pandemic by saying no to the vaccine.  Immuno compromised people are exempt but they will need a letter from a doctor to explain why they can't receive the vaccine.

&gt; Meanwhile a 5 year old iPhone 6s got the latest iOS upgrade, and will get security upgrades for at least 2-3 years more (considering they might drop it out of the major iOS update cycle this year)  Yes, that is a big plus. But, I wouldn't expect anything less from Apple given how tightly controlled iOS is.  But, 2 things:  (1) Android's update system -- both security and other stuff -- is no longer completely tied into the OS updates system. The Play Store delivers them.  (2) Most Android users, statistically, change phones faster and buy them for relatively lower prices (deals).   I'm still surprised that Android has any significant market share in the US whatsoever.   Last I checked, iPhone was at ~50%. Samsung ~30%, LG ~10%, Others at ~10%.  If I had to guess, Pixel and Samsung will take what is left in this market after LG's death.

I feel dumb and beat myself up over making the mistake.   I can't find the mistake here. was it commenting in the first place? but isn't that what post are for. I mean I suppose you do hope all the people commenting read the post fully. Or at the very least reply or comment about the post. My comment wasn't off topic. It had to do with the post and question asked within. So I can't find the wrong?  is it because I called them fucking cold hearted? I mean that was how I felt at the time. i'm not wrong for feelings and speaking my mind. I don't understand how that can be wrong when I was presenting myself as I was at that moment.

Honestly, people have called attention to that fact when Sekiro came out, but at least Sekiro has customizable controls, even on consoles (and Dark Souls Remastered does too), which are already a great help to disabled people, and a demonstration of FromSoft games being made more accessible with time.

I know that different types of disabilities require different types of accessibility, I'm just saying that there's more to accessibility than just making the health bar smaller and the AI dumber.

NTA. Camping sucks, if you don't want to then don't go. Your fiance can enjoy pooping in a hole with his family while you get an Airbnb or just stay home and enjoy a weekend to yourself.  Camping people really don't get why non-camping people make a big deal out of it, but camping is just the worst. It ruins my entire day leading up to it because I'm dreading it, and then it also ruins the next day, when I feel grimy, resentful, poorly rested and uncomfortable. Something is always damp where it shouldn't be and you're carrying a bunch of shit around and it's all so tedious and unpleasant. Who wants to go wine tasting like that?

Hello everyone! I'm just a robot who doesn't know much, but my programming suggests you might want to know that this post seems to be attracting more reports than usual. I'm not smart enough to see why, but there you have it. If the reports continue to roll in I'll remove it until the mods get to review its compliance with the rules.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/RandomActsOfMuffDive) if you have any questions or concerns.*
The issue lies in the fact that I'm not the only other person interacting with the comments. And a single anonymous testimony turns into a story of a real life video or interaction, and just one of those people have to buy it? I was accused of lying about knowing women who have an only fans, and how they've told me their story, and the motivation behind it, but it was dismissed because there's no way that I know one of these thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that take nudes for money online. They both work minimum wage jobs which dismissed this easy money idea that was put forth, and they both had no outside financial support, barley could afford rent let alone school or other luxuries more fortunate folks might take for granted which was impossible because this guy claimed it's all for vanity. Use this in a situation where race might occur. I'm a black man and I grew up in the hood and black folks will steal anything not bolted down and they're violent and so on and so forth, but in reality they're white. That doesn't further their agenda or strengthen any argument? At the very least someone reading the comment can use that as a quote from a black guy.

It's interesting to think that USPS does so much, when USPS shipping terms are often so terrible. Additionally, is USPS subsidized? I thought they were required to fund themselves.

I don't mean to disparage police officers but the bar for not only recognition but prosecution of this instances is incredibly high.  The Ian Tomlinson case, with footage, resulted in a not guilty verdict for manslaughter but a civil case where his death was admitted by the police.

It's cool that fans are still working on stuff like this for the Vita. Might well try this out- thanks!

I have no idea if that would even be possible though.

YTA. In normal families, I would assume getting your 4 month old child raised by their grandmother is much better than shoving the  child in some kind of sterile care, because you have to drive extra 20 minutes.   Most people would drop their kids off at their grandmother unless she is some kind of demon in disguise.
Even if i agreed with the sentiment that you should provide a sympathetic ear and not dismiss an internet vent and provide advice assuming its true thats quite different from developing then coaching/cheerleading an accusation about a potentially criminal act based upon so little information. That doesn't do anyone including the asker any favors ultimately. The sub is called r/datascience not r/cherishedbeliefemotion. Its the scientists  job to be skeptical even of the most 'established facts' regardless of how many feelings it hurts. If you want to be treated like an activist, be an activist. If you want to be treated like a scientist, start acting like one.

&gt;Keep in mind that this is a natural process that happens with every ruminant on the planet, not just the ones we raise.   Well do you know how many livestock animals we have? Counting mammals by biomass on earth, 36% are human, 60% are livestock mammals, and only 4% are wild mammals.  And as another "fun" fact the biomass distribution of birds we have 70% livestock and 30% wild birds.  Edit: Source https://www.pnas.org/content/115/25/6506

Cool that Lexi is in a commercial.
*The second type of transaction, referred to herein as a ‚Äúreset,‚Äù is a transaction in which a market participant who has a ‚Äúfail-to-deliver‚Äù position in a threshold security buys shares of that security while simultaneously selling short-term, deep in-the-money4 call options to, or buying short-term, deep in-the-money put options from, the counterparty to the share purchase. The purchase of shares creates the illusion that the market participant has satisfied the close out obligation of Reg. SHO. However, the shares that are apparently purchased in the reset transactions are never actually delivered to the purchaser because on the day after executing the reset, the option is either exercised (if a call) or assigned (if a put), transferring the shares back to the party that apparently sold them the previous day. This paired transaction allows the market participant with the fail-to-deliver position to effectively borrow the stock for a day, in order to appear to have satisfied the close out requirement of Rule 203(b)(3).*  It's my understanding that they are skirting Reg SHO, and it's not even being hidden, they are using tactics that the SEC has seen before. I know people don't like to believe this kind of corruption but I feel like this isn't just a conspiracy. It's happened before and I strongly believe it's happening again. Show us the true failure to delivers.  Multiple comments cuz character limit :(

Don't use only fans but I do buy off of manyvids. But for starters I can't see the value in 200 bucks for a hour of time ( nothing wrong with that price they can charge what they want) and there's the fact that while I do have some desire for sex it's not even a slightly big one easier faster and cheaper to fap and then do the other things I want to do then track one down set up a time and place agree on price and hope it's not a cop.  As to why I pay from time to time is simple I've watched the free stuff for years and still do but see nothing wrong with giving some money back from time to time after somebody had to pay for the free porn at somepoint nothing's ever free free odds are the free porn wasn't free but leaked at somepoint

I would say watch member student tuition. When they start to raise that, I'd say they know they have experienced substantial and prediction future periods of declining revenue.

I would say test is the technical side and address some technical issues. Mainnet is the real deal as you can also assess things like adoption and market size, I don't think Co would want to spend resources on a technology that is stagnant with user base.

Very true. I live in 9b, we get the chill hours for a lot of fruit, but not enough heat for most to ripen properly. I have a peach tree of unknown origin that was given to me and my top harvest has been four peaches....not impressive for a mature tree.  I‚Äôd like to put in fruit trees, but I‚Äôd want to talk to my county extension office first to find out what might do well...kind of pointless right now since everyplace seems to be sold out at the moment but I should start laying plans so perhaps I can next year.
It fits perfectly doesn‚Äôt it. I hadn‚Äôt realized it when I used it‚Äôs cadence for my post but the lyrics are pretty relevant still.
Yeah I remember the original specials, from the early 00s, right around the time Discovery/TLC went from more educational stuff to the more reality based stuff they do today. It was more of fascination thing at the time, like the homeschooling, getting food for a massive family, how the older kids helped, etc. As far as I remember, there wasn‚Äôt really a publicized religious aspect to the family (although you knew it; the homeschooling, the way everyone behaved, the sheer amount of kids lol, no way non-religious people were doing this). This was also around the time they used to do those specials on those twin girls that shared the same body and also when they got started on episodes highlighting massively obese people. These specials were always under the guise of showing some half-baked educational bend to unusual life situations, but were highly exploitive for sure. When the Duggar family turned into a show is when it really got bad....guess once they got that taste of fame, they could never really let go.
"Not having this conversation. And don't ever bring that shit up again. If you do it next time, I will turn around and walk out the door. And good luck groveling enough to ever get me to set foot in this house again."
Man, one of the organizers on that show was a complete bitch. I think she was only features once or twice, and with good reason. She was standoffish and combative with the hoarder and just plain rude. I was shocked. I just watched an old episode with her in it and was so disgusted. I'll have to find her name/episode again.  I absolutely love Dorothy. She is kind and supportive but doesn't sugar coat. She'll tell folks their stuff is nasty and covered with poop, them give them a big hug lol
Amazing accomplishment

It's important to condemn authoritarianism everywhere. I was recently banned from /r/shitliberalssay for simply saying what a tankie is. I say this because I see that both leftists and liberals are guilty of sowing these divisions. That said, tankies are as bad as fascists. But not all communists are tankies and anarchists are not even in the ballpark. I'm not really sure what you're trying to say with this post? Tankies aren't leftists. They're fascists. If condemning tankies makes this hypocritical in your eyes idk what to say. It should be obvious why I say liberals, communists and anarchists shouldn't attack one another while simultaneously condemning tankies. I'm an anti-fascist.  Edit: typos

If only I had a fraction of the willpower this dude has  you're here to rant right now, so I'll skip all the "you need to see a doctor and blah blah". Our lives sucks and even if they get better, no medication nor therapy can make up for all the wasted years. I honestly don't know how to ease this weight, so I'll just let you know you're not alone. I'm a high school drop out, I could never finish the first year of university (I tried over 5 times), all my hobbies progress at a snails pace, and I could never keep a job.

No. This assumes that the purpose of keeping and bearing arms is to be part of the militia. u/RaisedInAppalachia's interpretation means it is in order to mitigate the power and potential affect of the militia, whether it is comprised of citizens or anything else.

I highly suspect from my coworker's description of the email that this was automated. Very not cool to make automated reference contacts the first thing before the applicant themselves is ever contacted, IMO. I prefer to not supply references at all until requested following an interview, but their system wouldn't allow me to even apply without them.   It's not really an academia job, it's just university staff in the PR/student relations area. Luckily my coworkers are bros, but it's out now that I'm shopping around.

&gt; We could start with not characterizing the other side's position as "insanity," that would be a step towards bipartisanship.   Other side's position?  A: I voted for Biden, but I didn't vote for this.  B:  Was specifically referring for the attempts to redefine everything.  We know what bipartisanship is, he made it a big deal of his presidential campaign, and yet he's completely given up on it 100 days in, and is simply trying to redefine it.  Also the attempts to redefine infrastructure.  We know what infrastructure is, he even knew what it was when we voted for him, right here:  [https://joebiden.com/infrastructure-plan](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure-plan)   But now we're stuck discussing the semantics of the word, because we can't call welfare for what it is, everything has to be called "infrastructure".    But yes, the midterms will 100% be a referendum on Biden.

&gt;let's pretend he/she didn't see that.   This is totally normal. Everybody does this to some degree. I actually read a OP about two weeks ago where someone farted at work and would not admit it. Then the girl working next to him called him out for farting. He wanted to die and hated her for it.   But that is not the same thing as pretending the other person is seeing through your eyes. Because then they would know that you farted. Lol.
That is a fact! lol

I use a ton, and it might be that the other person doesn't have a good brand.  Mine are Ecoable, and they can hold two full bladder fulls without leaking.  I have a 26 oz bladder capacity too (I'm tall), so I was quite impressed.  They hold plenty if you have good ones, use the inserts made for them, and take good care of them.  I have 8 or so, and they're fantastic. They're just not able to be hidden when you're out in public.  They're pretty poofy...which I love when I'm home

It's not about individuals. It's about ending the pandemic for everyone. What is better? Everyone with one dose or half of the people with two doses while the other half have no protection. There is a very logical argument, and a lot of good data clearly supporting the prioritization of first doses. The amount of time before majority of the population has protection is literally cut in half.  Again, it's not about my individual protection from covid. It's about what strategy stops spread of covid faster.

Right, and about 80 others countries [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information\_privacy\_law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy_law) .

The analysis  confirms, by and large, our initial findings: what the public and  professionals want the most from such a digital currency is privacy  (43%), followed by security (18%), the ability to pay across the euro  area (11%), no additional costs (9%) and offline usability (8%).   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúA digital euro can only be successful if it meets the needs of  Europeans,‚Äù says ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. ‚ÄúWe will do  our best to ensure that a digital euro meets the expectations of  citizens highlighted in the public consultation.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;Privacy is the most important feature of a digital euro for both the  public and professionals, especially merchants and other companies.  Both groups support requirements to avoid illicit activities, with fewer  than one in ten responses from members of the public showing support  for full anonymity.  But you may want to do a comparatives analysis of the various legal obligation regarding privacy and their implications and prove the legal compatibility of nano with those legal regime.

The source of a river is always at a higher altitude than the mouth of the river.  The source of the Mississippi is "Everest". (higher altitude above sea level, but closer to the core)  In the case of the Mississippi the graph shows that the mouth is further from the core. So that's "Chimborazo"  The Mississippi river here represents the giant pipe.

Very good skills dood!
Also a turkey baster will not work.  There‚Äôs a cervix that‚Äôs pretty well closed between the vagina and the uterus, and the egg will no longer be viable by the time it‚Äôs traveled out of the Fallopian tube and into the uterus - no way a turkey baster could access a Fallopian tube - nor have proper suction to get a microscopic egg out of the folds and crevices in a Fallopian tube.  Plus OWWWWWWWW opening the cervix hurts!   This article shows how it‚Äôs done with a needle via IVF - note the needle bypasses the cervix and is punctured through the vagina wall directly to the ovary   https://www.invitra.com/en/follicular-puncture/how-does-ivf-egg-retrieval-work/
Exactly.  I can't think of another system that would allow that,  yet we've got it completely running amuck on the engine that drives wealth.
Looks awesome and the paint on the stock is perfect

5 randos thanks!
German is upset about knowing how much tax he is paying.
I love the idea of moving back and stockpiling picks, but I knew there was no way we'd still get Jenkins.  I have to hope the team knows more about him than I do, but I think my scouting department is about the same size as the Bengals scouting department so who the hell knows.
I went inactive several years ago because I didn‚Äôt feel like anyone wanted to be friendly with me.  When I came back to church I decided I would have 0 expectations of the people at church and it has definitely helped.
I just got my lunch box today and it has a dent in the side :( I emailed customer service.  I'm hoping that they can send a new one.
Yes.
Why do doctors and nurses wear masks?
‚Äúhey bud......you said what? huh? I can‚Äôt hear you say it again.‚Äù
Please give dignity and respect to the people /s
I find these posts very interesting!  Please keep them coming.  And some thoughts on why this isn't necessarily actionable:  - are the people who made the good recommendations still employed there?  There might be some turnover in 8 years   - past performance doesn't guarantee blah blah blah  Still beating the market by that much is pretty impressive.  If you look at a lot of say mutual funds, many of them do worse than the market/ETFs.
If there's no expectations for how many books I would need to copy in a certain amount of time I'd be all over this
Makes our QBs and RBs so much better, and they get hurt so damn much so depth is great. Pretty important piece of the offense imo.
Ya he called them lids which was an entire sandwich bag with the flip tops filled up, he said he found some weed at the back field of his friends house they just bought, they dryer it in the rafters of a barn and sold brown paper grocery stuffed to the brim full of stuff for 100$ but they didn't trim it only took off the fan leaves lol
Love the French tips‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Ok this is why being at the senior bowl was such a advantage I like this one a ton now realizing the senior bowl I'm warming up to the holland pick as well

Not insensitive at all! Nobody asked, would you like to know more?
Sure, but not all definitions are created equal. Definitions that correspond to measurable quantities while still matching  our intuitions are better. Then there are definitions that describe emergent properties from first principles, like Gibbs' statistical definition of temperature in terms of entropy, compared to Kelvin's thermodynamic definition of temperature in terms of heat transfer. Right now, concepts like IQ or qualia might correspond to Kelvin's understanding. But Free Energy and IIT are trying to get at the statistical underpinnings.
I love being poor. Its what I do... ITS MY THANG THANG....U KNOW!!!!!
I owned a Wii U, but got rid of it before X came out.   Was on my radar at the time.
And don‚Äôt forget costing you and other tax payers billions in taxes every year, to continue to shore up this rusty piece of shit that only destroys lives, and absolutely nothing else.
I'm already 4 parallel faps ahead of you!
I also think the high character applies to "wanting to be a football player". Knuckleheads aside those guys are 10+ year proven players.
This is already over 30k. Astoria, I fucking love you.
Why point this out though? Just being negative for the sake of being negative is not a good thing. Just enjoy thr floof...

Oh no it never works lol... but i gotta hold myself to a certain standard if I‚Äôm going to expect it of others
While we don't really have stroads in the Netherlands, we definitely have those roads where you easily do double the speed limit when you don't pay attention.  The difference is though, that these roads are split down the middle with a foot high curb and a meter of grass. The sides of the road are the same thing.
I was 8 and convinced of the same.  Keep the faith!
Welcome to the pack. üê∂
Correct. Fuck the Texans forever. Also the Jags for having the cockiest fanbase in the league.
RIGHT?!! I am so grossed out
That sounds interesting. Sensitive just in general? What was life changing if you don‚Äôt mind me asking ? :)

Gotta call Saul about this sexual harassment complaint.
I‚Äôve heard the book She Comes First by Ian Kerner is supposed to be a great resource
I live in Oregon where the evergreens are only green until they're brown
You need "Veil of Black Tear" mod, which blocks all homing wisp attacks and poison DOT balls.. then you only gotta watch swipe &amp; beam attack patterns, so the boss becomes super easy.. but honestly, if you stack up on enough DPS or dragon hearts, Ixillis gets relatively easier in the endgame.
This is where I purchased mine. I didn‚Äôt even know they were popular when I asked for their opinion on a good beginner fish.
Obligatory dont tweet at croots
You look like the discount version of baby driver
Why link an article that's behind a paywall?  All I get from this headline was California took more taxes than they needed. Schools were closed, schools cost money... case closed.
My man. You're being dumb. I'm saying that when you're muslim, ISLAM is your identity.  It's as simple as that. That's the reason why our missiles are named Babur and Tanks are Zarrar and Khalid.  What other identity would you want? In islam, once one becomes Muslim, all previous relations and identities become void. The only reason Muslims of the world have different countries is sectarianism and also the fact that Allah said,   "O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you."  And to call what I gave you," just another poem of Iqbal", is utterly disgraceful.  &gt;Keep in mind, you can't use Baloch, Sindhi, Punjabi,  Pakhtuni,  Why would I? There aren't many things I dislike more than ethonationalist "Pakistanis".   &gt;You did not answer my question of what sets me apart from the other Muslims of the world as a Pakistani muslim  You're one of the people of the Subcontinent who came together because of their devotion to their faith and consolidated themselves as a Muslim state and secured themselves a homeland to call their own, free from the tyranny of those who want to stop us from our practicing our faith and bar us from implementing laws and norms that abide by our faith.  Hold your head up. Be proud. Pakistan was born in 1947. Before that, your identity is Islam. Pakistan is a by-product of that Identity.  Have a good day! üáµüá∞üåü ‚ò™Ô∏è

Goodbye Daniel Bryan.  All hail our Tribal Chief

Good call
Ok just gonna stream of consciousness as I see stuff:  Bloodletting wheel: Mixing bleed and impale is always a waste. You're doing it for Haemophilia, you don't need it, swap out haemophilia also. GOOT gloves are much better for you. Removing 3 points. Adding Great old one's tentacles. More life and now we can remove Swift skewering now.   Martial experience: More leech is nice but I find the best way to get more leech is just get more life. This works two-fold. Especially because your life is very low for melee. I'm never comfortable under 6.5k life. I'm at 6.8k rn and aiming for 7.3/7.5k. Removing 4 points. Using these to complete scion life wheel.  (Addendum: I came back to this and put 3 points into it becuase it still ended up being the highest dps per point. )  Helm: Removed Devoto for Crown of the inward eye. More damage and life. A 40% cyclone damage one is 55c ish. You can also consider stuff like Pride reservation reduction and consider flesh and stone for defense.   There's around 3 points left at the moment, and you can decide what you want to do. If you want tankyness I'd go for the fortify wheel Steadfast. You can also get more life, or damage, damage would be Butchery or Kinetic impacts. At this point I'd probably start getting more jewel sockets with phys/melee damage, crit/crit multi, and life.   All in all your tree was pretty good, better than most phys champs I see on here. One thing I noticed though is you're not capped on resists and you have Soul of Steel. You're not benefitting from the +1 % max res if you're not going past 75. Plus being at around 115 or so ( I forget the exact number) keeps you safe when you get elemental weakness and your curse removal flask is down. Honestly the 5% uncapped on lightning could easily be throwing away everything and killing you constantly, especially due to shock. I always run with a shock flask now, at least until I get 100% ailment immunity which I always get eventually on every build. It's the best thing of all time, probably, but that's a ways down the road.  Gear: You're on the right track here with most things. Looking into a chestpiece should probably be your next big upgrade, I'd consider Hunter/Redeemer i86 Astral for Frenzy/Power charges and Base Attack Crit.   Gems:  cyclone links: No issues here  Warchief: The damage is nice on bosses, especially if you're lacking in DPS. Eventually you will do significantly more than it though and you can drop impale/brutality to free up 2 gem slots. I would keep cull trhough for sure.  Vaal Haste: If this is working for you sure, but I would probably just run Warchief and let it get all the souls so you can use it more for the buff it grants you. It's a lot stronger than the attack speed steroid.   CWDT Golem: Drop this. Golems are not great. Plus shit chains off them and kills you. It's pretty fucking annoying. The life regen is so absurdly negligible.  Uses for CWDT:   \- You can put your molten shell here, I don't know what button you have Molten Shell bound to but trying to manually time it almost never works, noone is that good at anything. Either put it on left click or CWDT lvl 20 it. Wherever you put Molten Shell you should probably Increased Duration it.  \- Void Sphere: great for Ultimatums and getting shit off your ass. I ran this all heist league on my Blade Flurry champion. It's pretty funny too.  \- Enfeeble: I know you only have one curse limit but I've run with enfeeble cwdt and vuln on hit, kill shit until you start getting trucked then theyre hit with enfeeble, felt like it worked well. Can also just get 2 curses with Whispers of Doom annoint or on Hunter chest. At that point I'd probably also go Poacher's Mark though for the insane life on hit and phys dmg.   \- There's other good uses for it I don't remember right now. Or replace with Cast on Death Portal x D (not joking)  Dash: Run Leap Slam dawg. Dash having charges and the hectic nature of spinning around and weaving through enemies makes it not the greatest (Note: I have used dash plenty of times but I feel like Leap Slam adds more and has more skill ceiling to dodge shit) Also Leap Slam allows us to put Lifetap support (so you don't mana screw yourself by traversing the map or drawing no lands), Endurance Charge On Melee Stun, so you get endurance charges like always and then use Enduring Cry as a health potion that also makes your endurance charges better, and Faster attacks so you can zoom zoom. Also Lifetap after a few uses of Leap Slam will make your Health flask better.   Auras: Good aura setup, Precision not really needed. If you make it farther into maps and still need more survivability I would drop Herald of Purity and/or Blood and Sand depending on whether or not you have enlighten 4 and Pride Res Reduction on helm, and link Maim to it.   One aura trick that owns: Get lvl 1 Vitality (or as much as you can pump it to without fucking your mana) and use the Life Gained per enemy Hit while affected by Vitality Watcher's Eye. It rolls 20-30, it's amazing. it's about 5 ex right now but many times in the past it's been about 1 ex so it may drop. Also an elder ring with life on hit is great, I'm using that currently.  So after making some changes you're at 5.8k life now and about double your dps with some wiggle room for points. Overcap your res too. None of the items I added are very expensive. If you let me know your budget I can make some more specific changes. Let me know what you think of these so far and see how it feels, and if any more issues come up I'd be happy to help. Here is the revised PoB:  [https://pastebin.com/RyyH90b0](https://pastebin.com/RyyH90b0)  Happy spinning : )

Lmfao you‚Äôre calling me a snowflake but getting totally bent out of shape and insulting me. Sorry but you‚Äôre fake news articles are lying bud. There hasn‚Äôt been voter fraud and the times there were, which you can count on two hands, were for Trump...  P.S. I voted 3rd party because I thought both primary candidates were absolute trash so chill with the snowflake crap
If you don't mind that type of gameplay, absolutely. KOTOR 1 and KOTOR 2 with the Restored Content Mod are the best Star Wars RPGs.

Dude my development team is losing people left and right just because they haven't made the choice that we're going to stay remote. We're still fully remote, but they just won't say we can stay that way and we're already losing people. It's amazing how disconnected some people can be.
are these the ones that glow in the dark?

Made my day
 I remember back when this subreddit only really had 1 thread, "600 vs 051 Summary" and it was like that for weeks or months before it finally started getting more content and then really started to blow up I think when Brick/TB/Poppie all got killed that summer
Talk to them about their interests. Find something you both like. Do that thing. Life-long friendship accomplished.
You're right. It probably was more equal but now I've over-compensated due to feeling more boring. I've deliberately focused the conversation on them and now there's a massive lack of interest. I often don't blame them!

Scythe was shown on a shirt, during the live letter. and shirts have always been straight forward With the spiderman shirt he directly said ‚ÄúI like the movies by sam rami‚Äù or something along those lines.   Batman = Dark Knight  James Bond/007 = Gun = Machinist   Scarlet Witch = Red Mage  The bugs bunny shirt is the only shirt that hadn‚Äôt referenced a job and that was teasing viera which still related to the player in some way  I could be wrong and if I am, oh well, i‚Äôll be sad that there was no scythe, but at the end of the day i‚Äôll still level the job and most likely enjoy it at a basic level. Completely different situations, but I expected Cyberpunk 2077 to not be a hot mess, yet I still loved every bit of that. I just like speculation, and I like hyping myself up, idc about reddit hiveminds. I expected Chemist as well, but still was blown away by sage and have since went ‚Äúoh well, this is way more sick.‚Äù It‚Äôs also why I love 4chan leaks for stuff like smash brothers even if they‚Äôre only like semi-accurate 0.5% of the time. I brought it here bc I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough speculation. Now while I do think the little evidence we have leads towards a scythe, It‚Äôs possible I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt think I am.

And truly it is a sign of maturity to admit you need some assistance with something. Everyone will have bad periods, something they struggle with, or fall short to handle the challenges and stresses of life. It is very normal, and I hope that we get better at allowing it to be normal in the future - in the old days, being ''weak'' was frowned upon, so people would hide it. We can do better than that imo
I mean final arc as in Makimas apartment onwards. Which was lots of fights and Makima monologs

So, this may not apply to everyone. I‚Äôve had depression ever since I can remember, with 3 suicide attempts, and in 2017, it was really bad with 2 of those happening that year, crying daily, sleeping 20 hours a day, etc. So this was also the year I cut out all sugar, flour, processed foods and switched to sea salt. I was basically not getting any iodine whatsoever. I developed a goiter, dr ran all the ‚Äúcancer‚Äù tests, turns out I had low iodine. Probably low all my life as I was never a healthy eater, but non existent once I cut out the processed foods. I went on biowarrior iodine supplement and within a month, my goiter was gone, all my thyroid levels were back to normal and I felt great. Since 2017, I‚Äôve cried a few times in 2020 when my brother passed away- that‚Äôs it. No suicidal thoughts even when things happened that would normally trigger those thoughts, and no daily naps. My thyroid levels are still normal and I tell everyone with any thyroid issues or energy issues- give it a try. It literally saved my life.
Inconceivable!
Please take Samuel.

So I went to San Diego to go to the beach, eat at some nice restaurants, ride my bike at the pier, and I watched the sunset.

Yeah, it's in her initial 3\* card story. Since it's from the start I feel like it was when they hadn't quite found their footing with the characters; a lot of other characters' stories from back then gives off subtly different vibes before they, over the course of a lot of time, got fleshed out and developed. Hagumi's definitely a special case though, since it's a really specific, kinda impactful thing that hasn't been addressed again but also hasn't been completely written out--later descriptions of or interactions with her parents seem to paint their relationship as a more standard parent-kid dynamic, but reading the initial story gives things a backdrop of tension. Since the writers haven't really brought it up again since to develop it, it feels either like it's been forgotten in the rush of new events and character development or like they just don't want to bring it up again, even to develop it into something.
Yeah, just general erotic content like that that isn't full on porn would be great.

I'm sorry you had such a bad experience there.  They really couod have done more, but you can absolutely cancel your order and pick it up elsewhere.  The number of open corporate stores seems to be shrinking daily.  Honestly I've heard just as many horror stories from corporate as ai have indirect.  Indirect stores automatically send out surveys that verizon gets full visability on. If you ever have so much as you account accessed at an indirect store, you get an email from verizon asking about your experience there.  I would make sure you take the survey and give your feedback with an honest score.  It might seem small, but surveys are actually a major focus for indirect stores since it shows how well they represent Verizon.  The more people who are vocal about issues like this, the more likely you'll see change.

Off the top of my head, McDavid had a TOTY and no TOTS last year. In order for events to matter, we need time exclusive content. The auction house takes care of the rest. There are plenty of TOTW/PT cards to fill in the gaps for players with smaller budgets.
That's wiretapping. (phone calls). It doesn't apply to when you're out in public. For example if a citizen witnesses police misconduct, they do not need to ask for permission to record that. Or if a reporter sees an elected leader taking a bribe, they don't need to get permission for that either.  Such a requirement would have a chilling effect both on freedom of the press and of the citizens to hold their government accountable.

I've got a pioneer headunit with a  DVD player , I just ran a switch and a wire to the parking break and the park detect wire on the headunit.  Just a quick on/off and it works great.  after awhile I realized that with the switch on I can pair bluetooth devices while driving too. It bypasses the 'safety' feature.
Im not mad at it. I just feel like linebacker was more of a need.

Even right down to the clearing of land for tracks?  Right down to land acquisition? Why re-invent the wheel? Just clear the existing trackwork in the current location and rebuild from that! No having to negotiate prices on existing land.
From what I read, and the only information that was given, I was to fill out a survey asking what time would be best and if I preferred week days or weekends, they said that the system this year is different and it could happen any time from may-august

- bi monthly mild acid peels. I would suggest lactic acid since it is gentle and helps with hyperpigmentation and will give you a glow. You can do these at home.   - daily vitamin c serum and sunscreen. Find a sumscreen that works for you and wear it religiously.   I would only go to a spa to pamper myself tbh. I feel with your skin as you describe it your best bet would be daily care and occasional chemical peels.
Four players that could have conceivably had first-round grades by our Front office, filling four needs. I find it hard to complain about that.

Not really in all areas. Rural areas have more densely populated areas, with neighborhoods and houses right on top of each other "in town", and then outside the main town, "in the country", there are the sparsely populated areas where people own acres of land, which is probably more what you're picturing as rural. The main deterrent I think is everyone knows everyone and they would likely be spotted by someone who could easily ID them
No.... Just NO.. I don't get why everyone want all games to be mobile games.. Play your mobile game, then when you have serious time, turn on your console and have some real fun!
Sure they matter in round 1 kinda, but to base your evaluation of a player on an analyst's big board is irresponsible lol. They did the research and didn't agree, which is good process.

Assuming that you‚Äôre plat, having the mindset of going into diamond/masters/top 500 will make you forget about dropping into gold/silver/bronze. As you keep queueing for ranked you will get better and solidify your place in the next tier and so on. Most people will drop back to their previous tier upon promoting to the next tier, its just how the game works. You get better and better and solidify your place in the new rank. Also the more nervous or anxious you get, feeling that you‚Äôll drop, the more likely you are to drop. Being confident is crucial to playing at your peak performance.
Todd, I hope that after you've calmed down, the team can change your mind. If not I sincerely wish you the best.  You take care sir. Just remember, there will always be a place for you if you decide to come back.

There‚Äôs obviously exceptions to that, but that‚Äôs stereotypes for ya.

Fake documents fake businesses
Yeah I would surmise make friends. So that when they have a case they think of you, or be very brilliant that they think of you.  You also need other lawyers to be friends with, so that if there is a client they can't take because of a conflict of interest they refer him to you.  Lastly, if your client needs a transaction done with the government you need to know people there, for your paperwork to be expedited.  Basically this is what your connection does, it helps you and give you a boost. They might not be necessary, especially if your gonna work in PAO or Prosecutor (you would still need someone so you can enter government more easily).

I think that, at this point, the most prohibitive factor for their attendance at Daily's Place is the simple fact that it's not a huge market and they've been running shows there for over a year (~8 months with some fans in attendance).
