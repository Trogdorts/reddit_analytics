Hey, would you mind sharing more information about these iron patches you used? I would love to learn more. Thanks!
I wouldn't really say this is a question that shows the true nature of people. Like, what does it say about you if you'd terminate or? That you're unwilling to spend the rest of your life supporting someone who as of yet doesn't exist? I think it's more revealing for someone to be willing to do that. One has to be a very special kind of person, not necessarily in a bad way, to be able to accept such a fate.
How do you check this total activity. Sorry I‚Äôm new
I'm confused because like a third of "If I saw this on an actual person I'd scream", and "How much effing time" are completely normal  haircuts (In my opinion).
There are no drawbacks unless you're super insecure
There is some creasing starting, but the reason it‚Äôs not bad is because I really haven‚Äôt been wearing them. When I first got them I was able to wear them some, skipped summer, and I can‚Äôt wear them at my job now. I actually took these photos for an eBay listing to sell them. I don‚Äôt really want to sell them, but I know that it‚Äôs going to be a long time before I can really enjoy them. (I‚Äôm also trying to instill some minimalistic principles into my life too, I‚Äôve been getting rid of a ton of stuff I don‚Äôt use often)
Oh shit! You're so right! Well now I want to know, what's your foil?
Of course you are.  You're a brand new account posting about nothing but silver.  Get the fuck out of here you retard.

They'll have a court order to repossess your stuff, however they cannot force entry to your property. So basically don't open the door and they cant take your stuff. They can legally remove a car on the driveway and any other property they can get access to.  If you try and physically stop them you're risking assault. They have the right to bring police along to ensure "the peace is kept" i.e. the police will help them.
I have tried modern P basses and 5 strings and I love bigger necks. I kind of dislike my bass‚Äôs neck. It was my first bass I didn‚Äôt know what I needed or wanted

Or, like he said, it was his last game before he moved. I'm guessing everything else is packed and this was left so he'd have something to do after everything was packed.

Sorry to hear that. For future reference, pduyu is on the [universal scammers list](https://universalscammerlist.com/search.php). I messaged the mods about changing the links in the sidebar to have it more prominent and take off the dead links~~, but most are inactive~~.
 Edit 2: For some reason a lot of people that are commenting keep assuming that I'm saying I want to skip learning polite Japanese and go straight to a magic method to speaking like a native or something. Not at all. I have studied Japanese over the years and was told I sounded like a textbook before, so I was only looking for resources that would help me learn more conversational/natural sounding Japanese that's not Genki or something.   I never said learning standard forms makes you sound robotic and if that's what you got from my post then you're literally projecting hard. A lot of people understood exactly what I meant when I said that textbooks can make you sound unnatural. So yeah, idk why it was so hard for you to grasp.

It's unfathomable to me how people can support an obvious malignant narcissistic grifter like Trump. I'm no genius but it was obvious to me since my first exposure to him in the media and that was years before he decided to run for office.

When trying to pay using the ‚ÄúApple Pay with Wyre‚Äù option, there is no option to set slippage. Using the Transak option, slippage is 3.43 but fees are way too high ($30ish to deposit $200).
I like your idea and did something similar in mine. I thought about the chakra changing the light waves that are reflected by their bodies to basically create an illusion for the people around them (so it'd go more into the direction of genjutsu), similarly to how Muu becomes invisible. I almost like your idea more though now that I'm reading it because it sounds simpler haha. In my version, a shinobi using it also has to constantly use chakra for it, and active chakra usage is what other shinobi (especially sensors) are trained to detect.   So if you go infiltrate your enemy using the transformation jutsu, there is a real threat of them noticing something's wrong.   Imo, the canon transformation jutsu is way too busted. Just think of all the possibilities you'd have if you could just physically turn into anything. And then it's a jutsu learned at the Academy.

You can't murder unarmed people and not go to jail.  Nobody had guns.  They tried to take away his guns and got murdered for it.

From what I understood this guy works at Amazon, maybe he needs to have the identification on him when he does deliveries or something. So it makes total sense he needs two different ones. Why oh why some people would go out of their way to say he needs to look a certain way every day when that can easily be fixed by printing a second id tag? Hopefully more companies will stop to care about stuff that doesn't rly concern them. Anything else is purely hate and bigotry.
what excuses? you expted fudge to carry on karma, then said he is only on karma cause he cant carry? now he is on a carry and is beating alphari in the 1v1

Dude I was gonna leave it? You gave me 2 different town names and moved how far away you were as soon as we tried to get a meet up started.

I kind of understand what you're alluding to but unless arteta does end up a success and stays for 5 or 6 years I don't see how you can possibly distinguish him from what Mourinho is doing right now at Tottenham, and therefore the entire long term project point is pretty invalid. Comparing him to Klopp or Pep is quite frankly ludicrous, their pedigree before arriving at their current teams was fantastic and it's part of the reason Klopp in particular was afforded so much time. Liverpool took 4 years before they won a trophy. Claiming that the most succesful ones stay for long periods of time is absolute bollocks and Mourinho is a prime example of that. They have both been in the job for a simar length of time and so far Mourinho and Arteta have built similarly good sides. How can you say 'they knew it would end up like Mourinho at Spurs'. We've been on a bit of a bad run in the league recently that still isn't nearly as bad as arsenal's horrendous run nearer the start of the season. We're in all 3 Cup competitions still and Arsenal are in 1, we're 2 points above them in the league with a game in hand. This has all been done on very similar budgets.   We've made some good signings and are starting to rebuild the squad post Pochettino, which was a complete mess. We are much better this season than we were last season but our problems aren't just gonna go away overnight, why is Mourinho expected to transform us yet patience is afforded to Arteta? We've played some fantastic football at times this season but people just seem to competely ignore it at times.  This whole project thing is just a massive buzzword that people seem to apply to clubs that hire a young manager that likes playing attacking football, people said the same about Lampard and he's been sacked after blowing ¬£200m on signings that he clearly did not know how to utilise.  Calling Poch our most successful manager since the 60s is completely ludicrous as well by the way. He did a fantastic job but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go do some reading on our history!
Absolutely!

Your assumption that what applies to you applies to everyone else has neatly encapsulated why we need that button.
Watson‚Äôs cap hit is close to that. Stafford will get a new contract within a year based on what LA gave up. He‚Äôll get something relatively high. Are you then saying you‚Äôd rather just trade up and draft a QB? Every veteran is going to come with a high price tag and then some additionally will require picks.
I like your username. My primary school teacher used "han tatar" to refer to a hypothetical person that probably won't do a task OR as a synonym for "in the past" OR as a place one should go to if we got on her nerves. Always thought it sounded funny.

‚ÄúThe use of surgical facemasks is ubiquitous in surgical practice. Facemasks have long been thought to confer protection to the patient from wound infection and contamination from the operating surgeon and other members of the surgical staff. More recently, protection of the theatre staff from patient-derived blood/bodily fluid splashes has also been offered as a reason for their continued use. In light of current NHS budget constraints and cost-cutting strategies, we examined the evidence base behind the use of surgical facemasks.  Examination of the literature revealed much of the published work on the matter to be quite dated and often studies had poorly elucidated methodologies. As a result, we recommend caution in extrapolating their findings to contemporary surgical practice. *However, overall there is a lack of substantial evidence to support claims that facemasks protect either patient or surgeon from infectious contamination*.‚Äù  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/

Generally speaking rabbits instinctively dislike being picked up and held (exceptions exist, of course). They're prey animals, so when they're lifted off the ground they associate it with being carried off by a predator. I recommend mainly interacting with your bun on the floor.

The Lancea Sanctum from Vampire: The Requiem (at least 1E) said something similar, although in their telling it's Longinius who became a vampire after Christ's blood landed on him following the spear in the side.

Huh, interesting - i tried it last year and thought it was terribly bitter. In fact it was so bitter, it's the only cigar I didn't finish. Glad you enjoyed it though!
I would disagree. Some that come to my mind.  Main event of Wrestlemania XXX when Daniel Bryan wins.  Eddie Guerrero winning the WWE Championship at Wrestlemania XX.  For me on a local level, when Kerry Von Erich beat Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Texas Stadium was an amazing ending.  Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels at Summerslam 2002.

Is it worth crafting runes or should I wait until crafting is buffed? I'm in desperate need of runes(and I am still grinding dungeons, but noticed I could get some more from this.) and am unsure if saving will benefit me in the future or if I should just go for it now.  Also one thing I wanted to mention is I have max ancient magic stones. Which ancient runes are worth crafting? Thanks!

Couldn't it possibly be a way for him to be affirmative of his "whiteness" as he is a mixed kid (even thought white passing) in a majority white scenario? Like, maybe he is exposed to other racist discourse and is reproducing it (and even escalating it) as a way to avoid being singled out as different.   I am sorry if I sound ignorant with that, I am not in the US, and my daughter is only a baby, but this reminded me of scenarios I faced a few times in Brazil. I have some cousins who are mixed white-lebanase and they were quite racist (and generally obsessed with whiteness, trying to hid their middle eastern background) growing up even thought their parents were pretty decent people, and it always seemed like a way to fit in.

How does that explain the increased power output when there's no skin exposed, or when riding outside at night?   Lack of cooling is the answer.

Headline: "'Culturally Jewish' Philadelphian Dude dropped in what is still not, and won't be for another hundred years, Tulsa, Oklahoma."   I would imagine literally everyone around me would *fucking hate me*, given that mass relocations/deportations *to* Oklahoma, just started. Some of the Native Americans with experience with Europeans would figure out that I was like, essentially a fucking alien, very quickly. I'd probably do my best to explain my understanding of the knowledge gained in the next 200 years, starting with super easily demonstrable stuff. I dunno I'd figure it out. In order to demonstrate my value to the peoples I encountered.   Those are steps one and two. First - get them to understand that I'm not the Americans they've encountered, nor am I a European, even if I have the same skin color. Time travel might be out of the question as a concept, but "Not British / French / Spanish / Colonist" is, I think, a very achievable conceptual goal, and once that understanding is reached I think we could get along. Second - demonstrate that I can do something worth food and shelter.   Probably though, I would just die. Because it is January.

Decent enough! Did this slightly faster than normal, once I fixed TRek over TRIP.  19A and 35A both nice (former also topical), wasn't quite sold on 52A - it felt very... Green Painty? I don't think [Unmanned Min. of Defence aircraft] would be accepted with UKMILITARYDRONE, and this reads the same. Wasn't a big fan of OCULI - I think that was an inevitable consequence of going for BEARHUG? Fill beyond that was alright - I don't remember there being any real points of "ugh", which was nice.
I saw a video on youtube someone transferred funds from td to shake pay so idk. What should I do then if I wanna invest is there any way possibly
From what I've seen, the game definitely looks nice. Insane that we can get that kind of graphics on a handheld console.  but it feels like the feedback from hits are lacking. Like just compare 2 random longsword solo runs, it feels like you're cutting nothing in mhrise, while in previous titles(mhw, mh3u, mhp3 etc) there are obvious signs you're cutting through the monsters, and there's resistance while your weapon go through.  And then the UI feels like a regression rather than innovation. I've only played mhp3 &amp; mhw, and then watched a bunch of other mh series, but the sharpness indicators and gauges became so easy to see in MHW. Like sure, make them different to fit the theme, but why downgrade it in mhrise when it was good? But that's coming from MHW perspective. Console wise, it's a huge upgrade in almost every aspects. The QoL changes are obviously superb, very cool change to be able to toggle the map/zoom, and see the potential cap for HP/stamina bars.  Also we got cats b4, and dogs now. Yuge upgrade. Waiting for the day we can bring piglet to battle.

This is one of the reasons why media: tv, movies, video games are being inundated with social justice/leftist dogma.  To people who saw the world as it was before all this, it seems like trash content for an agenda.  However to young kids, whose minds are moldable jello, it is programming.

Hedge fund managers with shorts in other companies will get out of those positions before another squeeze can occur. There will be no other squeeze like GME for a while. Hedge fund managers are greedy but learn quick.

I don‚Äôt understand why people go after specific journalists like this unless they are constant click baiting weirdos like Manish Mehta.   If he really has gotten nothing right as OP says, then he should have a lot of examples of things gotten wrong if he‚Äôs going to make that claim.
It's actually a compliment, it comes from barbarians at the gates. A reference to Wall Street takeover funds that killed a much larger fund. Before that, it is referencing the Germanic tribes that took over and eventually overthrew Rome.  So yeah it seems kind of appropriate actually. The overthrow of Rome.

Vibrato is a style/quality of singing, and it's something you consciously choose to do, so I don't know that I'd phrase it as "causes vibrato", but to add vibrato to a note being sung you simply slightly tighten and loosen your vocal chords to fluctuate the note being sung so it's not just a constant flat note.  In the same way you would add vibrato to a violin or cello note by slightly moving your finger to shorten and lengthen the string to change the pitch a slight amount to the same effect.

Naked short selling is not liquidity. It artificially inflates the float.   We‚Äôre pushing two months of consecutive fails-to-deliver, which means a bunch of GME shareholders are actually holding IOUs because the market‚Äôs plumbing is broken.  If the SEC, brokers and clearinghouses had a hair on their ass, they would have forced buy-ins on the naked shorts for all the fail-to-receive holders in the market.   But the DTCC clearing firms aren‚Äôt going to force buy-ins because the order flow from hedge funds is too important to their bottom lines.   The SEC is gonna blame WSB because that‚Äôs an easier headline than fixing the fucking plumbing and putting an end to naked short selling, which will continue to lead to leveraged bear raids on struggling companies.
TBH, you will probably have to retake all of these classes in college unless your college lets you test out of them (which isn't always an option). This may be a contrary opinion to what others would say, but I would perhaps suggest doing linear algebra and diffeq‚Äîif you're majoring in CS you'll definitely take data structures and algorithms and an operating systems class in college, whereas you may not get linear algebra or differential equations naturally in your course sequence. Those are very very useful classes (especially linear algebra), because lots of concepts from those classes show up in CS topics (e.g. linear algebra is everywhere in machine learning). As for option 2, I don't really know what's covered in a "discrete mathematics" course‚Äîis it an intro to proof-style course that covers graph theory, sets+relations, etc? If so, perhaps it'd be nice, but I still think linear algebra is more valuable, especially since lots of graph theory is very intuitive and easy to learn on your own (plus the way it's covered in an intro-to-proof math course won't be that useful for CS applications). And honestly, lattice point geometry is a niche topic for a reason‚Äîcompared to LA and diffyq, it's just not as useful. Of course, I may be biased as a math major, but that's my 2 cents.  (Note I'm discussing in terms of how useful the classes will be. If you are solely concerned with standing out and don't care how useful the content is, then options 2 and 3 will be more "distinctive" than 1 probably.)

Agreed but serious question....  Something I've seen happen during the pandemic....  If a non custodial parent resorts to other means to pay child support and eat during a pandemic since jobs are scarce....and gets arrested....thus removing them from their child's life.. ..who's at fault?  My homeboy was set to be sentenced a week ago but it was delayed due to covid closing the court. Just wanna know what I should tell him. Things really are fucked up and folks are this or that with judgement....not realizing things are NEVER that simple.  All so he wouldn't fall behind on CS.....

If anyone have a claim, i.e. the Islamic treatment works, then it is up to the claimant to prove the case. Until then, science regard it as unproven.  By conventional wisdom we can safety say alternative medicine doesnt work because so far none of them have any scientific backing, but then again its not in the framework of science to outright dismiss anything that may consider as alternative medicine. Sadly people often take science's indifferent stance as a weakness.

I'm pretty tame man. I'm Indian - we're not exactly champion meat eaters generally speaking. I usually just eat chicken and goat.   I have cleaned chicken though. I get it. Its meat but its not human meat. Honestly I can't even think about eating dogs or cats or monkeys or whatever exotic meat people are eating these days. It just doesn't compute for me.   I respect your take on this but please understand not everyone is like you.

I think we all want to see Armin b2b Ferry vinyl on friday (and I'd say it's likely to happen), other than that GAIA would be a nice surprise as well. I'd also like to see RAM, ReOrder, Nifra, Guiseppe Ottaviani, MarLo, Above &amp; Beyond, Orjan Nilsen,Ruben de Ronde,Aly&amp;Fila, Andrew Rayel and so many others that I can't think of right now. Then I'd like to see artists that are highly unlikely to happen for various reasons (Jorn van Deynhoven, Paul van Dyk, VER:WEST)

I think it's just that older people have more at stake so they might be more cautious. But I agree, the amount of dudes asking me to be a cougar at 33, like brah, really????

Definitely an external expectation. Being the initiator, lifting heavy objects myself, paying for things myself, are perfectly natural for me, and it was society that told me no, I was supposed to be passive and need help with things.  I don't know about attractiveness. I dress reasonably modestly but not in a burka because that's what's practical.
The difference here (and I know some people won't like me saying this) is that Obama was relatively inexperienced at wrangling the Senate, in particular. He had spend a few years as a Senator and knew the people, but wasn't a master of the game. Obama fell for the delay tactics because he didn't know when the R's were being insincere.  Biden is the master of the Senate game. He knows when he's being slow rolled. And does not play that game.
IMO, spend your time working towards a better career that doesn't have you rely on a side hustle.

I don't know the air feature but just a quick search seems it simply boosts the high frequencies which something you can typically do in EQ. To answer your question I don't think it will work if its not connected to your PC.  My 2cents is if youre going to invest in a 18i20 might want to consider moving over to a more advanced DAW like FL, Cubase or cakewalk as they have ton of more tools at your disposal. I know Garageband is super user friendly but when it gets down to recording multiple takes, simultaneous tracking, song arrangement, collating sends etc. these tasks get so much easier and fluid with a pro DAW.
You...damn it you got me. The detail with invisible cloak is good.
Hey big boss, I get where you're coming from on this one lmao.  This whole GameStop thing has really shown us how many people are feeling understandably disaffected and powerless to exert any lasting change on the world around us.  Suddenly people that were barely making rent a few weeks ago are paying off student loans and receiving the kind of cash they never imagined they'd have - all at the expense of the once untouchable "powers that be" in finance.  That's an intoxicating value proposition if I've ever seen one, and you already know I'm holding GME too lmao.  Honestly I don't think anything you just said is irrational or too weird.  Just try not to get yourself in too deep, if your car is your biggest asset then at least try to have enough set aside to keep it running.  But yeah, it feels good to feel like maybe - *just* maybe - we all might be able to get that leg up that seemed impossible at one point.  Good luck bud, here's hoping you hit it big haha

Why are they so thick?
I was going off of what you said with the redness/non cystic or fungal. It's been a long time, but mine was mainly pustules/papules/nodules. They were caused by hair follicles a lot of the time. If you have a derm I'd tell them that what you're on isn't working well enough, they'll set you right. And if you don't have one, I'd say it's worth looking into (sorry to say as I know many don't have easy health care access)
Op that makes total sense idk what you‚Äôre on about.
So my rule of thumb (this is not financial advice) is that I never buy more than 14-21DTE, no more than 10-30% OTM &amp; never without indicators from my own TA that give me lots of warm and fuzzies. These are my rules &amp; I do not break them unless there is something telling me to pull the trigger. I bought wayyyy OTM AMC calls last week that made me a fuckload of money - but because beyond my own indicators and TA/DD - I've been following the hype &amp; new cycle. So take your time to assess, but also look up this cat on youtube - InTheMoney - that dude goes deep into options. Also Thetagang cats if you're into low returns &amp; mitigating risk. A lot to learn, but take your time and educate yourself before you pull the trigger.
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre getting downvoted. You‚Äôre pretty spot on. The top of the draft doesn‚Äôt guarantee anything except for guaranteed higher payrolls for lottery picks.   Masai/Webster find pieces that fit the team/culture at reasonable costs. They move up the ladder through internal development and pouncing on opportunities. They are masters at flipping houses.   When the Rudy Gay tank was about to happen, it was still the Colangelo team &amp; culture. He hadn‚Äôt put his imprint on the organization yet. The imprint is now in the DNA so he would be less likely to all out tank. For the most part teams that tank don‚Äôt recover in the NBA. It‚Äôs hard to get into the upper echelon of teams &amp; the cost, financially &amp; culturally, of falling out of the upper echelon is very high.
Can you even... Ban yourself?

I seen Sebby say that Jannisz told him that Noah has the best mechanics in the game but he tends to do unnecessary flashy plays sometimes instead of just shooting where as Vadeal is more efficient/simple in getting the job done.

&gt;The execution is terrible.   The only bad part of the execution so far is not making a clear enough delineation between the Air Force and the Space Force.  &gt;I think a CalTech NASA example might be a better way.

As much as I'd love a shakedry jacket with a pocket or two, I think it's out of the question for most as a hiking jacket. Even if just for emergencies. Trim fitting 20d paclite with an elastic waist and wrists seems like the way to go for a lightweight emergency shell.

Corday, Boulet and Benton are just normal folks they don't belong on the list. Weaver and Romano do though. They both seek power and they both can be antisocial.

I am sure he had his reasons for being the way he is. But he is just intolerable. If he was my boss I would quit right away.

No. You hit her at least 75% of the times but it would be exactly 75% if PA has 100% evasion.  PA has 80% evasion that means that if you don't have mkb you hit her 20% of the times.  So 80% chance to evade attacks so you evade 80 attacks out of 100. If the enemy has an MKB he will still hit you 75% of these evaded attack (80*0.75 is 60) + the enemy still hits you that 20 times when you (PA) didn't evade attacks. So overall PA gets hit 80 times out of 100.  I don't wanna judge you but it's 6th grade math.  PA has a chance to evade attacks but it's not 100%.

Two different taxes at play here which people will get confused  1. The taxes you pay when buying a car. EV cars should have tax incentives over IC cars, no doubt. Why? Because we want to move away from IC cars being the default option.  2. The taxes you pay when you drive the car. Rego, Road usage etc. EV cars should be taxed the same as IC cars here, they do the same damage to the road, the cause the same congestion. Why? Because we want to encourage people to not drive as much as possible. Should be a last resort, not the first option.

Only Ser Artys was permitted within the solar, and stood by the door, to give the two royals enough space to talk.  Myranda took a seat by the table, sending a servant for some refreshment if requested, but as the door closed, finally could speak.  "You have mentioned Harroway's in your letter. Does the North have interest in the Town?" she moved straight to the point, raising a brow. "I seem to recall a diplomatic incident..."

Thanks. I do not get any hum. Does your guitar to amp do this hum without the pedal, and the pedal just magnifies it? Or is the hum only when the pedal is inline? Could be a number of things. Power source? Internal wires too close to something. You‚Äôre best bet is to post some good photos and ask the community. Without that it would just be guessing at the issue.
Your path looks pretty good to me.  IME, you'll be wanting that amp pretty soon.  Planars can't be driven to their full potential without them.  I just got the JDS Atom and I find it to be fantastic.  It drives both my old Hifiman HE400's and my Audeze LCD-2's very well, as good or better than my big tube amp the Doge 6210.  I like things a little loud, so on low level recordings I have to dime it, but it's fine, there's no distortion, and satisfaction is there on my Audeze's.  Bass extension is there, there's nothing like that planar slam.  Lossless and hi-res files are just so dynamic, with so much punch and detail.  I'm loving it.  It's great that such a budget friendly amp can drive such nice and expensive headphones.  I'm also using a cheapo dap, the Surfans F20 off Amazon, and it's really great!  Exceptional sound for not much money, and I'm playing DSDs and all kinds of hi-res files to my amazement, the dynamics sometimes shaking my teeth loose.  I have a DAC, the Audioengine D1, and I guess it's okay.  Clean and nice sound, but sound out of my laptop's headphone out is not bad either (it has Beats Audio, only time the brand's been any good).  The DAC in my Surfans is better, my how technology flies.  I find dac upgrading yields very diminishing returns, though there are megabucks solutions out there.  Output of the Apple dongle might be low for planars and the Atom though.  The JDS Atom DAC would most definitely be a good match with the amp.  Good luck on your journey, it's a great hobby.  And nice to see you're getting into planars, they're my favorite.  When driven properly, they will slam you into audio bliss.

Selflessness literally means prioritizing the long-term well-being of others over your own. Cooperating with others because it enhances your long-term well-being is not the same thing as being selfless.
I affirm the power of God, but I do not believe it is in audible voices or signs and wonders. The use of such things has passed. And I would say if you need those things still, you are actually the one denying the power of God. He does not need those things to prove Himself, He has scripture, and that is sufficient.

I had triple-itis in my right shoulder: arthritis, bursitis, and tendonitis. That last one is actually tendonapathy, but it's not as fun to say with arthritis and bursitis.  Anyhow, hard to say. On the one hand, I've learned to be my own health advocate and seek my own answers. On the other, I've learned to be mindful that I'm not a professional.  To that last point, I recently had rapid, profound pain relief thanks to months of physio, chiro, and massage. Because I had been on a high dosage of SSRI and didn't change it when the pain broke, I found myself in a hypomanic phase where I was certain of things happening with my body that probably weren't, at least not in the way I thought.  So yeah, talk to physicians and care providers, ask lots of questions, and new your own advocate. Just be prudent.  I dunno, I don't have real answers, but that's been my experience. Hope it helps. üôÇ
excerpts:  After a group of protesters managed to disrupt operations at Dodger Stadium‚Äôs mass COVID-19 vaccination site Saturday, some Los Angeles officials expressed fury at the demonstrators while calling for increased security at testing and vaccination installations.  Los Angeles Fire Department officials closed the main entrance to the stadium ‚Äî one of the largest vaccination sites in the country ‚Äî for about an hour Saturday after a group of between 40 and 60 demonstrators appeared on Stadium Way holding signs that decried masks while shouting unfounded claims about the dangers of the vaccine.  The group dispersed around 3 p.m., and there were no arrests or injuries reported, according to LAFD Asst. Chief Ellsworth Fortman, who oversees the department‚Äôs COVID-19 response. Fortman said approximately 5,740 doses of the vaccine were issued Saturday at the site, which distributes between 5,700 and 7,700 doses daily. Workers were still vaccinating people inside the stadium during the hour that the main entrance was closed, he said.  Both fire and police officials have said the group was nonviolent and that the decision to close the entrance to the facility was a precaution. The protest left several city leaders infuriated, with some questioning why police weren‚Äôt more aggressive toward demonstrators, contending the LAPD has been more proactive in quashing anti-police or Black Lives Matter protests.  ‚ÄúLook, the world sees this. What it does is it undermines our public safety community. It‚Äôs not good for our public safety community for people to believe that there‚Äôs inequitable treatment,‚Äù said L.A. City Councilman Gil Cedillo, whose district includes Dodger Stadium. ‚ÄúThat does not help them do their job. When some people get coddled and others don‚Äôt.‚Äù  ...   Andrea Garcia, a spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said the city is ‚Äúreviewing vaccine site safety protocol‚Äù after the incident and will established designated spaces for protesters should demonstrations be staged at vaccination sites in the future.   ...   Cedillo said he was especially furious that the demonstration took place in his district, which has been hit hard by the virus. In recent weeks, Cedillo‚Äôs office has posted multilingual signs in parts of Westlake, Lincoln Heights, Highland Park and Koreatown warning people they were entering a ‚Äúhigh-risk area‚Äù for COVID-19, and he also said he‚Äôs sent staff members to knock on doors to provide information about vaccinations to senior residents.  Cedillo‚Äôs district includes several neighborhoods that are predominantly working class and Latino, two groups that have been disproportionately impacted by the virus. The number of Latinos in L.A. County who are dying from the virus on a daily basis has surged to a shocking degree in recent weeks.  ‚ÄúThis mob feels they have a right to try to stop people like seniors, janitors, housekeepers restaurant workers and supermarket workers from getting the vaccine that they covet. That they want,‚Äù Cedillo said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just very offensive. Very arrogant. It‚Äôs an incredible sense of entitlement.‚Äù
The sad part isn't just the lack of money, but the ignorance that goes along with living on the edge of poverty.  I was an honor roll student my entire school career but I knew college wasn't an option because of a lack of money.  My Dad never paid attention to a single report card and looked at school as childcare more than preparation for anything beyond.  Without the internet (1990s) I had no idea of the other options available to cover tuition.  I heard about loans from friends but there was no way my Dad would have ever signed any type of loan paperwork.  Again, ignorance of the world and possibilities.  "I'm a laborer, you have to be a laborer" mentality.  I managed to crawl out of that life but I do wonder how different things could have been for my brother and sister if any adult in our family had a little knowledge and hope for the future.

Literally never had a second thought about mine, or knew that they were considered different or that there was even a term for them until maybe a year ago. I'm not self conscious about them, but I am now hyper aware that they're there and I'm upset that it's a thing I think about now.  Goes to show just how fake and stupid beauty standards are :/
Probably something along the lines of this  "Thank you for trusting me with this information. That sounds difficult/sad/frustrating/etc. I'm willing to listen to as much as you want to tell me. Let me know if there is anything I can do."  Generally try not to give advice on the situation unless the person asks for advice. Usually people just want someone to hear what they have to say and acknowledge that the way they are feeling is valid and that they're not alone.

She's not.
not exactly, when a trans man identifies as a woman for that portion of his life, its because he thought he was a female (because of his physical body resembling a female and others around him telling him he was a female), not because he was actually a woman  what im saying is, no one transitions genders. the trans in transgender refers to transitioning how they see themselves, how they are perceived and referred to, and how they present themselves. when someone transitions, they arent becoming a male/female/non binary person, they are changing the way they are perceived (ie asking others to call them by a different name or by different pronouns, taking hormone blockers, taking hormones, getting surgery, etc [also, it should be kept in mind not all trans people transition so that they can "pass" as someone of their gender, transitioning is simply to make said person most comfortable in their body])  now in the case of, i guess you can call it active genders, like genderfluid, genderflux, bigender, etc, its also a similar case. when a person discovers they are genderfluid/genderflux/bigender, it also doesnt mean they become that gender, they just found that they are of that gender. but when i prefer to be perceived as feminine in one day and masculine the next day, you could say i was a woman yesterday and a man today. but i wasnt just a woman all those years before i found out i was genderfluid  hope that helps!

That is revionist history since people now see she loses to Lisa and probably to Jason as well, which most fans probably had no clue of at the time. So now people make up stories like "oh Ami and Marcellas would take each other", "Danielle would lose to everyone, even to Ami", to make an excuse for Danielle's mistake.  Marcellas atleast would take Danielle since he wanted a black person to win the season (just to be clear I am in no way criticizing that, I think given the disadvantage minorities are at in the game, this makes complete sense).   And since as I already said Marcellas was the biggest goat of the season (even more than Ami), and was completely loyal to Danielle under any circumstance, she should have protected him at all costs, even if she liked Jason and Lisa better.  That is if she were playing to win the game.   Booting Ami over Lisa at Final 4 was a bad mistake too, but atleast I can see a bit.   Booting Marcellas at Final 5 was the worst move of her whole game.

99.9999% of the time a corporation does something good it's for good PR. Just like guys on youtube videos who give homeless people one dollar with slow mo music if your intentions are to get something out of it or make yourself look good you're actually doing something selfish and shitty not selfless and good.
Good news! We don't want or need your sympathy.  But I do have sympathy for you; from your edits it sounds like you *definitely* need therapy. The amount of adipose tissue other people have should not trigger you so badly.

Well... no. This entire thing was a plan from the people at /r/wallstreetbets when they noticed that melvin had naked shorted gme-stock and saw it as an opportunity to make a money by buying stocks that would have to be bought at some point.  This isn't a bunch of gamers organizing to bail out their favorite store chain (because GameStop is honestly kinda shitty and really does deserve to go the same way as Blockbuster), and if it was it would have boiled down to them collectively screeching angry tirades on social media
i mean this just really isnt that funny

Exactly. The argument that NSW can't get their quarantine under control because they take more people, when they have more facilities and more resources is complete bullshit.
Drew Mac vs Goldberg starting off leads me to believe that Goldberg is going to win and then the Main Event will feature a feel good moment where Daniel Bryan or some other face wins and everyone just forgets that Drew lost 3 hours ago

Oh no.  Maybe I‚Äôm not as clear a typist as I believe I am.  We‚Äôve been under a mask mandate, like many of you, since March 2020.  It will be 1 year, soon.  Too long. A year lost.  A year of smiles and frowns.  Of clearly understanding what others are saying, especially after losing sound in my right ear in December, 2019. Fuck it all.  March 9 is my deadline.  As I stated a few posts back, I pull the mask off soon, mandate or not, and the chips fall where they will.  If a business asks me to mask or leave, I‚Äôll abide.  No fight, no arguing.  Just a simple goodbye, and never to see me again.
LSD lasts too long IMO. It's what I'd take after a long nap feeling super refreshed and rested, willing to make a day/night of it.  DMT is over fast.  Your experience does sound DMTish but lol if you get that on acid I really don't know wtf you might experience on DMT, as it's leagues above even super high doses of acid for me.
Environmental reports have been an ongoing issue with BC and were discussed on here or on r/SpaceX a couple of months ago.   I don't think they are related to the current problems but will be a more long term thing. Especially as the license for BC was for Falcon 9/Heavy launches not starship.  About the current FAA problem all we know is that SpaceX violated the FAA terms probably over range safety (kayak guy) and possibly by 1) swapping out engines, 2) over fueling SN8 (Quite serious as the bang could of impinged on safety of the public, and there is a lot of public watching the launch) 3) Not using the Flight Termination System  if the knew the header pressure was low.  It's not going to be as you suggested. But something important and safety critical.

Wanted to apologize again for so deftly forgetting to post the thread yesterday. I will ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen again ‚ÄîI‚Äôve set a *second* alarm for after the posting time!  ---  **Rewatcher - Sub**  Misunderstandings abound as Neal tries to act the part in front of everyone ‚Äîwhich apparently involves not letting his fondness for Elmelie show in front of the crew‚Äî Show overthinking things and underestimating Elmelie ends up in a conversation that Dorubu hears out of context and interprets to mean Show is worried Elmelie may be a spy. Reasonable thoughts on the individual character‚Äôs parts, though Neal is stretching it, but nonetheless all but show fail to effectively communicate with one another and so stuff gets messy.  On one hand, the fact that the show acknowledges that Elmelie‚Äôs escape was incredibly easy when compared to all the prior unsuccessful attempts is interesting and makes for a novel point of discussion, but on the other the cheap drama it‚Äôs being used to supply is less than ideal.  Shot‚Äôs been sidelined once more as Shot orders him to take a break. He probably wants to go out more than ever, since Elmelie is his ticket to power, though maybe word of her fleeing hasn‚Äôt reached him yet.  Neal is handling this rather gracelessly. At least take the poor girl aside and tell her she has your implicit trust, making it clear his act is purely for the other‚Äôs sake.  Hey, they *finally* fixed the Dana O‚ÄôShee! Guess it‚Äôs going to be Elmelie‚Äôs personal mech going forward.  The radar‚Äôs aura sensitivity is brought up again as the three battlers from upper Earth show up more clearly on it. Nice tidbit of continuity there.  It was utterly reckless of her to have come out like this, but at least Elmelie seems to be doing fairly well for herself. Despite getting overwhelmed when she is shot at and opting for a retreat, she managed to not get shot down while being pursued by two more experienced pilots in superior machines. She definitely fared better than Todd in his first few scuffles, at least, which is impressive for someone who only knew how to pilot an aura battler in theory.  And just like that Doroburu realizes he was wrong about Elmelie‚Äôs intentions and the rest finally talk it out. Interesting setup, poor execution, and not helped by the fact that ‚Äîplot-wise‚Äî we‚Äôre still just trying to move out of this cave, and we the audience have already seen that Elmelie is more capable than your average damsel in distress. This is quite evidently a filler episode meant to fill out the time between more pertinent story points because they need to fill out a full four cours worth of content on a strict schedule. If it were better written I‚Äôd have no issue with it, but as it stands I find this one of the weaker episodes so far.  We‚Äôre evidently in the slow portions of the show‚Äôs ‚Äòpunctuated equilibrium‚Äô style of storytelling...  ---  **P.S.** I saw some of you were questioning what Elmelie would even be doing now that she‚Äôs with the Zelana, so I guess this episode may have more merit than I initially gave it credit for, establishing that the characters know she isn‚Äôt the a big advantage for them and that she needs a new role in the narrative.

No worries, and I get the idea behind using such a tool to help you with your arrangement troubles.  I think a big issue here for me as well is that arrangement grows out of the patterns.  As in, sound turns into patterns, and patterns turn into bigger blocks, and these turn into arrangements, etc. It is the same thing, just at a different scale, if you get what I mean.  I play with synths to make cool sounds, I play with these cool sounds to make patterns, I play with the patterns to make stories/blocks, I play with the blocks to make a song. In that way arrangements grow.  Using an arrangement generator like this to then force sounds into it seems really weird to me. It is like writing a book with a certain font size and page limit. An interesting challenge to be sure, but also very at odds with how I would naturally let creative expression flow.  As I said before, I am sure such tools can be used for discovery. Using random generators to turn patterns into blocks etc, can definitely give you diamonds, it can absolutely inspire. But it seems to me the tool is not designed with this in mind. Of course, if you are able to see this, and use the tool as a tool and not a guide, great I'd say. But I fear for many it will inspire the wrong mindset.  Making music, or any creative thing really, is really a thing of two minds. It is the creative vomiting, unfiltered expression, as much as my ego will allow it. And then a process of cleaning it up, sorting out the diamonds, deleting all the fucking slime. Then back to vomiting again, then back to cleaning, on and on. Eventually structure forms, it becomes tougher, harder to bend without it breaking. Fear can come, oh god, I hope this is not shit. But the right mind will say, it is what it is, I will push on, I will detail this fucking turd, because it is my turd, and I do actually like it. At some point the detailing will reach a point where changes are so minute they don't really matter much, and you call it done. Or perhaps you say fuck it, grab a sledge hammer, smash it to pieces and grab what you like to vomit a new track again. Who knows.

Hey, I had the same problem choosing between Tamer awak and Nova succ.   I always liked hard class that takes a lot of time to master so Tamer was perfect choice to give it a try and I loved it, but I wanted to try something new and easier. So I switched to Nova.   Easy grinding with huge AoE was fun and I felt so powerful clearing mobs with one huge AoE compared to Tamer where I almost broke my fingers spamming spells.   After 2 weeks of grinding on Nova I felt like it's not fun anymore and I missed the hard playstyle like it used to be on Tamer. So I had the same decision easy class that will be good for grind, but eventually gonna get bored of it OR progressing class I really love playing, but grinding gonna be much harder and even less silver/h.   I chose Tamer, cuz no matter how powerful classes are you should always play class that you enjoy playing no matter what other people say and no matter how weak it is as long as you like it. All that progress you gonna make on your alt will be waste cuz you could have it on your main class that you enjoy playing.  Don't listen to people, don't look on meta (if you don't wanna be high end competitive player) and play whatever you enjoy the most!

I'm trying to keep my closet pretty small, but it's not working. Haha I need to go through it again and purge things that I never wear or have way too many to wear in the average month (I'm looking at you, t-shirts!).  T-shirts: 17 on the shelf/laundry with probably another 6-10 in totes right now.  Long-sleeved shirts: 8  Pants: 3 pairs of pants, 2 pairs of dress slacks  Vests: 2 - one quilted, one suit-vest  Sweaters/hoodies: Too many! LOL 13 total, 9 of those being sweaters or cardigans. I do knit though, so that's my excuse! :) These take up the most room in my closet by far.  Dresses: I'm not nearby my closet atm, but by my memory count, I have \~13, 5 of which are formal dresses. About 6 of the 13 are winter/sweater dresses.  Skirts: 2, one of which I might get rid of because it doesn't work with any of my outfits. I wore a lot of skirts/tops as a high-schooler so I really got sick of them after a while.   Dress shirts/blouses: 3  Shorts: 3  Sleeveless shirts: 5  Coats/jackets: 3  Shoes: 11 pairs, 4 being heels/fashion boots, 3 pairs of flats, then a pair each of crocs, hiking boots (my go-to shoe), winter boots, and exercise sneakers.  Total items: 83 clothing items, 11 pairs of shoes.
Same kinda. Less sickened but a bit more curious.

Glad to know you like it. I started learning game dev 2 years ago. After a couple of months, I decide to make my first game as a learning project. At the same time I started making some devlog.   A lot of people from the game dev community encourage me to finish the game and release on steam. It is a big challenge for me as I have no experience to make a game. But I would like to give it a try.   Due to the limited resource, I would like to create something simple but still interesting to play. Sometimes I can run out of ideas. And it is not easy for me to see the problem as I am too close to the game. So I would like to hear more feedback from the group who like strategy genre. Feel free to leave any comment, no matter it is positive or negative. They will all help me to improve it quickly. :)  Discord: https://discord.gg/xvmRvDx   Game can be added to wishlist on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177580/Dungeon\_Slayer/

There are global mcgill policies about how final exams must be *kept*. Basically, the prof needs to keep the exams for a while after the end of the class in case there is a grade contestation or something of the sort. So they can't allow people to physically take their exam out of their office, for instance.  Then, there are departments that try really hard to stop students from sharing exams with others because it leads to situation like BIOL 201 a while ago where some students had the answers to the exams and others didn't. There are courses for which you can't come up with an entire set of *good* new questions every year, at some point there are a set of cookie cutter questions that are ideal in the context of the course and how you taught it, particularly in first year courses. I don't personally think it's that absurd to try reduce the chances of the contents of the exam being shared if it being shared is an issue in that department.  However, the situation you describe doesn't seem like a particularly useful or pertinent way of implementing this type of policy. It sounds more likely to me that these departments are facing extreme logistical challenges in term of providing support for students wanting to see their final exam and eventually seeking re-evaluation. Profs are usually kind of left on their own to deal with this and there isn't really a simple way to address this in online school. A fair number of profs are just crumbling under the added administrative pressure.

I know it's very undervalued. However I still think it's risky. Not necessarily in the sense that you'll lose money.. But you may out money into silver and 20 years later see it go up by a dollar/oz. It's a Huge market. Compare that to size of game stop it's not even close. And along with  There just happened to be the right conditions for GME to take off like it did. I'd happily be wrong as I own a bit of silver already. There already is sub dedicated to silver somewhere.
Yeah, I realize that. And what I'm saying is that the difference between a 200 and a 226 conduit is not going to*meaningfully* change your output.

Yeah, I wouldn't call Scarlett Empress to be a bad book per se, just, one needs to be in a mood for the type of imagery it is trying to evoke, and I definitely wasn't.

No his main style is kickboxer. He doesn't throw kicks "occasionally", you said that he doesn't throw it to do damage, okay but why does that even matter lol, to each his use of kicks. And exactly, you said he doesn't throw kicks to make damage yet he landed only one kick against Cowboy and it was the biggest strike of the fight.   We might agree if Legacy Conor is labeled kickboxer and Current Conor is labeled a boxer tho

If you notice, when you try to build something where a leg is blocking, it doesn't say that "Spidertron" is in the way. It says that "Spidertron leg" is in the way. This supports your three that the legs are actually independent objects in the code.  Have you tried walking him across a one-tile wide catwalk? It's kind of cute.
I hope tomorrow it will be possible for him to walk at least a little bit. I finally got him to pee outside :) he was happy to go outside and tried walking but he always sat down once we got too slow. I think the cone is really confusing him because he can‚Äôt really see and sniff around. He kept going all over the place and pulling suuuper heavy on the leash. I will surely leave early enough tomorrow so I have enough time to get there.
Oh of course üòò

Not to mention - have these desert parasites ever considered the detrimental impact their ‚Äúdesert raves‚Äù, bike tracks and packs of dogs have on the environment and ecosystems etc?!

Only time I learned something was in 6th grade we had the successor to D.A.R.E, which was V.E.G.A. (violence education and gang awareness). At an upper middle class parochial school in suburbia where the only POC in the school was the one black family that sent their kids there for a year then yanked them out.  The thing I learned?  My sperm donor was technically guilty of multiple felonies when he beat the ever loving shit out of me, but because it was "discipline" the cops couldnt care less.  Edit for spelling

1.8 pvpers are going to be the best out of any given players because, rather than any other type of player, they likely have the most diverse skillset and the best skillset for MCC. 1.8pvpers beat builders and parkourers, because parkour only trains movement and building isnt really all that applicable to MCC, but 1.8pvp trains movement, pvp, decision making and strategy which are all good for MCC, 1.8pvpers also beat out 1.9pvpers due to the competitive nature of 1.8 rather than 1.9, because someone known for 1.9pvp (no one is) isnt really gonna have much mcc applicable skills apart from their pvp. Whereas 1.8 pvpers (lets go with tapL for example) are used to playing in less vanilla and more competitive pvp (skywars and UHC in this case) so will have skills applicable to most games (skybattle, parkour tag, tgttos, bingo, SOT, SG, i could come up with a reason for any game really) because going up against other players is what the 1.8 community is all about
Yeah Tom had his 15 minutes of fame and played a blinder of a S1E1, then carried on being... Tom. I‚Äôm not sure what else people expected?

My theory connects. Sideous killed his Master after learning how to keep someone alive. To do it you have to drain the life force from one of their loved ones. The Jedi are not allowed to have loved ones which is why you can't learn the power from a Jedi. Palpatine was always putting Anakin and Padm√© together.  Padm√© was alive when Anakin left her, but Sideous drained her life force and gave it to Darth Vader. Technically Sideous didn't lie to him either. By losing to Obi-Wan, he forced Sideous to have to do that.

I agree. I was raging at the screen when Kovacic just lightly jogged towards opposition balls that slowly rolled in front of him to an enemy player.

I wanted to grind combat rank and after looking for some guides it turns out that Thargoid hunting was a good way to rank up. I thought to myself "hey, It's a good opportunity to try that for the first time and see how it goes".  I bought this chieftain armed with basic stuff to fight Scouts and after 2 fights (level 4 signals) I thought "Hey, is not that bad. I should try level 5"... Well, this is the result of that thought. I run for my life and 5 sec after my jump to a nearby star my canopy just exploded (I didn't expect that). The rest was the most intense moment of my life in a videogame. It was awesome,  would do that again.  &amp;#x200B;  E: I should add that it was intense not because of the broken canopy but because I was at 18% hull integrity and going down because I ran out of decontamination limpets.

Biden needs to tread very, very carefully. This isn't 2008. People don't trust the mainstream media at all, and that's the only mouthpiece these corporate cocksuckers have. Sentiment has changed. They can't just blame it on those who took out loans and expect people to swallow it.

It‚Äôs like overclocking, but less hot.   :)  But seriously, if overclocking (OC) is about getting ‚Äúthe most it will go with the power I can give it‚Äù, then undervolting (UV)  is basically ‚Äúthe most it will go with the power I WILL give it‚Äù.   Power into a chip = heat = noise, so it‚Äôs about optimizing the performance for your personal goals in terms of how much power, heat, noise you want to have. Because at stock, they are all a bit less efficient than they could otherwise be, so that they can all perform the same for the every-person.

If you don't issue a refund within 4 days of receiving the return (empty box or otherwise),  eBay steps in. Thats the window you have to contact them and show them that happened. The more proactive you are about contacting them, the better.   Over the 20+ years that I've been on ebay ... I have had buyers try to send me defective items from other sellers (IE they bought mine with the intent of returning a broken item they already had). I even had a buyer send me a wire nut just to get the tracking ID confirmed as delivered. I also got a landscaping brick once then got them to document their scam in messages.  Seller support is pretty good about helping me out even if it means reversing a decision. Don't rely on the web page options or chat bot. Call and get a human. They've seen it all before.
Thank you for the suggestion. I looked at these, however I can't seem to be able to get polarized lenses when getting this size unfortunately.
No worries, and Im glad you're trying to educate yourself. I have a bit of a headstart so Im always happy to help people who are genuinely interested in learning.   &amp;#x200B;  If GME priced shares below market value, their shareholders (including RH) would file a class action suit. The reason is because GME is not maximizing value for shareholders (like they would if they just sold shares into the market at the higher price and then used that cash to buy Valve)  &amp;#x200B;  If they did want to do some sort of stock deal, they could use some sort of structured product to do so. Im less familiar with these options but maybe they could grant options with a lower strike price or something like that

We belong to Earth, I belong to you~ El wants back into the plot! We're checking in with all the old guard aren't we? I assumed Loser locked her up and forgot to feed her. Instead she's trying to con the guard out of a very expensive model kit. Why... did it take her this long to attempt to escape? She basically walked out the front door. El died! This is a pretty unflattering sight. El died! Again!!  Loser realises her mistake and unleashes her inner dom on the poor drunk guards. I'm jealous. Why would El go to her dad's...? Neal has become the over cautious stick-in-the-mud whilst Show is the fired up ace pilot. They still haven't covered why El's music teacher is suddenly Shot's right hand woman. Father!? Brothers!? Agare, agare, agare, Gundamuuu! El died, part thre-four! What nice bandits... They're probably baddies due to the apple eating but it's nice that El has made new friends. Our brave hero is ditching his gf after exploiting her for inside information... Did you lose your nuts on the Aura Road?  Keen's gotten the shaft since her dad died... It's almost as if they're keeping her around for a rainy day. "Aura power is making him mature faster." The words of a shotacon. Ah, El caught on to their plan. Tbh I think I would have ended up following them all the way to their hideout. I'm too trusting. Anyway we get to see how badly outclassed you are without an Aura mech. Two of the blokes get their heads gnawed off, El's saviour gets gunned down, and the leader gets his head nommed too. At least Musiy cuts the leader some slack and frees him. "You're a soldier so I don't love you anymore!!" She says whilst running to meet her soldier boyfriend.   Oh, she's of course like Keen's dad and is fighting for her House. I'm sorry but El, and the Zelana crew for that matter, have no leg to stand on. Poor selfish El. Musiy tries to recruit the bandits to her house so now Drake even has the downtrodden of the nation fighting for him. Por has no idea what they're getting into. Musiy is putting up a great fight though. She's a natural Battler. She won!? Wtf is going on here!? Garou Ran, I choose you!! Show Zama has no dignity... Mikazuki was a fairer fighter.   Poor dad... He's laughing!? You're terrible. You're a terrible person and you should feel bad about yourself. This is so tragic. This is awful and I'm genuinely peeved at our heroes for it XD Keen is the only one I vaguely like but she rarely gets enough screentime to commit warcrimes. El shows no concern over her close confidant being hit with someone of the worst trauma I can think of. It's all about me, right? How did she put it? "I'm the only one stepped on for other's convenience?" You're living the life of luxury hen. Okay Neal... Your girlfriend got home before you so now you've gotta sound happy to see her. "Hey, Keen!" *Shit...* Is this some joke!? This is dark comedy yeah? I'm not feeling happy for this couple when he literally forgot his girlfriends name and we just saw nightmare fuel not five minutes ago. I'm furious right now!

This is a good analysis and I have nothing more to say.
That's what I've been saying!  Yes, the thing WSB accomplished was fairly minor in the grand scheme of things.  But they also managed a feat that has previously never been done.  And the movement of billions of dollars is always a big thing.  This money moved around primarily because some guy made a meme (that's deliberate understatement) and a bunch of other random dudes went, "well, why not?  I've got a few bucks."  It's a glorious example of the power of social media.
That's a common bug, might go away if you close out and try to get on again. Sometimes it takes longer

Not really. They‚Äôre next gen compared to what this game was launched on.
The original stocks were $GME and $BB over on WSB. I‚Äôve been a lurker since before the shrekli debacle. The mindset seemed to be $GME squeeze and profits of $GME squeeze would go into $BB because of solid DD. Things got a little crazy with all the people joining and trying to ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù so things got flooded and $BB kinda got left behind because of the short % being so low. $BB is a solid play, the more people know about it, the more people investigate, the faster the stock rises in anticipation.

Before this period I took it in college, exclusively recreationally on weekends in large amounts (2-3g) while drinking. Those are the only times I really felt big come-downs (anxiety/depression). I also learned how to get laid because of that so guess it was a slight net +
