JP: ‚ÄúMen are order and women are chaos‚Äù  You: Yup, makes perfect sense   Also you: Wait ok first of all when did Jordan Peterson say anything derogatory about women?
Do the samples show a before and after? Or just the after?
OH OH! OH OH!
No problem!
Childish or not, that's what they do. They feel they play better with their own people.   They have their own culture, with things we wouldn't instinctively understand. Due to that they won't get angry but politely just say 'it's fine, you're a foreigner' when you don't follow their second nature customs. However, online, this translates to, 'lol you suck because you aren't Japanese' it's basically that the game is their culture so we wouldn't understand it like they do.
I live somewhat isolated, in the suburbs of a moderately large city.  I feel like I‚Äôm not too close to a large population where I could just wait most stuff out at home.   So in most situations my rifle will still be simply for home defense.

Thanks for the info lads üëçüèª  So what you recommend? To keep Master reserves for possible rank or sell/burn them?  After all EA has a shocker of a reputation for ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to implement promised features.
8th paragraph, line 4, 3rd word.   assialant's   &amp;#x200B;  Also, why does almost anything involving our canine brethren, bring such joy to read?
Don't you think it's possible to disagree with and bash both presidents? Why does it always have to be one or the other? Just because he's speaking of Obama's failures and weak spots doesn't mean he doesn't have time to bash Trump.   This idea of only being allowed to focus on one troublesome issue at a time is stupid, people can be more complex than just hating Trump or just hating Obama.  But I am speaking to someone who just brought race into the issue for no fucking reason so it seems your thinking is pretty simple.  Get over the whole "they hate him cause he's black!" It's pure idiocy and just blinds you from the fact people had legitimate disagreements with his policy and job performance.  The same thing is going on with AOC and "they hate her cause she's brown and a woman!"  Or maybe they have legitimate disagreements with her view of the country? It's just racist filth that's being used to try to invalidate arguments from the other side, and it's childish.
It sounds like you've made up your mind but just can't execute your decision because you're worried about the fall out from her and everyone else. If this relationship isn't making you happy anymore, and she's ready for big life events and you aren't, it's definitely time to let go. You're wasting your time and you're wasting hers as well.

I see no proof of that; regardless, why would it matter the reason? How horrible, donating to charity like that! Sure is a good thing this sub hasn't stooped that low.  Put your hate boner away. It's sad that you don't realize that you're worse than the 1% you claim threaten and harass others.

Thanks, but I know where the orange crates are. They're bugged and not dropping Dye. And I have not gotten any dyes from an orange crate, so it's not the 10 dye limit that's causing the issue either.  Also, I'm WT5, dunno if that's relevant, but I figured I'd add it for completeness.

Yea, the skin and base should look the same in both pics as far a products I used. One had sunny VS overcast lighting, not sure how to fix that with my camera settings.

There was loads going on in this book. Sometimes difficult to keep up with. I feel that there have been an overwhelming amount of characters thrown into this new Series, it makes it difficult to keep track/remember who is who sometimes, especially if you don‚Äôt have chance to reread the previous book.
We have some remote users on the system already and they just started testing in the headquarter office.  I dont interact with the remote users much so have only heard rumors of the issues and bugs there.  But when my new direct report was put on the system without warning to me and I cant even help him acclimate to his roll as designer we are going to have problems.  This rollout has started and has generally been without communication to the management and training team. I'm in a position to bring my concerns directly to CIO and CEO so we will see how this goes.  We are slammed busy and cant afford even a slight hiccup without risk of losing big clients.
Well thats good at least.

I got a player for about fifty at Walmart right around 99, and they started to actually have DVD bargain bins around that time too, to clear out the overstocks. You could build a decent library cheap back then.

I thought it was good morning.
Many games now allow you to run at a higher resolution and have it scaled down to your screens native resolution. It is known as 'resolution scaling'. I am using an old cpu with a gxt1070 and I get better performance at 1440p than 1080p.  Do some research into resolution scaling for your specific gpu software or game.
Nuclear is important to develop as part of a sustainable yet energy-rich future, but it is far from the magic bullet reddit seems to think it is.  You can't get another plant online in the States in the next 15 years, and installing them is incredibly expensive.  Renewables have issues like intermittency, but these problems can be solved by 18th century math and elbow grease.  Furthermore, their cost floor is lower than nuclear, and will likely dominate the energy mix regardless of improvements in nuclear technology.   They can do what nuclear does, and they can do it *now*.  Our immediate actions (emphasis on immediate) should be primarily renewables.  This isn't an anti-nuclear post, I love nuclear.  It's more a post asking people to not write off any climate change action because it doesn't prioritize nuclear.

I mean there's millions of people playing the game. I'm sure a good chunk are casual gamers and younger kids. Best bet is to add some players that you teamed with that played more strategically.

I have a teleporting staff stalker that I‚Äôve been running Oro missions with. The teleport helps with the zone transitions, being a stalker lets me get to objectives quicker, and the staff provides AoE when I run into ‚Äúdefeat all‚Äù missions.   Definitely not the most efficient, it‚Äôs just the first thing i came up with.
Ooh. I think I would? The basic game mechanics are easy to learn! Honestly it‚Äôs such a good game that i think it would be fun no matter what.

The way I see it is that the Infinity Stone saga is over. So, what better way to represent that by getting rid of all the stones. No one can use them because they‚Äôre gone. When a new threat comes to the MCU, it‚Äôll be enforcing a new power.   Dr. Strange and the sorcerers use the time stone since it‚Äôs in their possession, they protect it but it‚Äôs also their greatest weapon. However, because of the time stone, that‚Äôs how they were thrown into the plot of the Infinity Sage. Thanos would come for them because they had something he needs. I‚Äôm sure Strange will still have a great story to tell since the threats they battle are more mystical, not physical.   TLDR; Time stone was useful for the MCU and Thanos, but not essential for Strange going forward in the new story
That's over 213,000 dry liters of barley. I have no idea how they counted that stuff.

What other food gathering could one do in an Australian rainforest?
They didn‚Äôt drain it all at once. The doctor was concerned about the possibility of blood pressure drop from fluid shifting, so he ordered drain 1000 at a time q4h.   Evidence shows that concern really isn't necessary. Ascites patients can have paracentesis for as much as 15L at a time without ill effect. But the doc was conservative, and we had to follow his instructions.

Your facts are flawed. Recent studies haven‚Äôt been able to confirm whether plants feel pain or not. The farthest we‚Äôve gone is knowing that they react to certain stimuli.   So how can you be sure that you don‚Äôt cause pain to other living beings other than animals?
Actually it's not. Guys were able to keep it much closer to 50-50 in that study when it came to ranking themselves relative to the other sex.

Well that's only because - [This message has been censored by the Chinese Government for your viewing pleasure].
&gt; It's different from turning into a monster aka a completely different being. Limiter breaking is done by humans, those who do not abandon themselves. It's very clear.  \*sigh* Source.  &gt; They're not the same at all, you're wrong. Gyoro Gyoro created monsters and was flabbergasted that Garou holds onto his humanity. Garou is fueled by his own drive and gets a rush from wanting to do things that are the exact opposite of being a monster, like protecting little kids and fighting for ideals. Garou never abandons his humanity and is the only other character aside from Saitama who is actually, legitimately mentioned to be in the process of breaking the limiter by the narrator himself. Orochi doesn't even go there.  Gyoro Gyoro's process, as stated by her, is her method to break through the "limit of growth" (which is exactly what the limiter is). She did it to Orochi, and she did it to Garou (in the manga). Garou gets stronger and stronger [wc](/s "and narration says his limiter is about to come off"). Orochi is a precedent to Garou's monsterification/"limit-breaking" (&lt;- notice the quotes).

That's fair enough, but do you know yet if it can be fixed? If not I'd rather hear it straight.   I can go back 3 months and there's a comment from Ben acknowledging the issue, talking about diagnostic tests, and then nothing changes or is openly talked about until a post like this one raises the issue again. Of course, each time it receives the generic 'being worked on' response.  It is incredibly frustrating when it's such a major issue.

I'm quite pleased with the MK characters coming, not so much the guest characters though apart from Spawn. I do think that the additional skins should be in a free update or something because the skins in the game are terrible.
You act like this and say red is toxic, that seems hypocritical. You play the server you want and I'll play the one I want. No need to randomly lash out because people enjoy something different.

It's not the fact that it has microtransactions, it's how they're used. The game is shamelessly pay-to-win, they took the heart out of the original formula, and it represents everything wrong with mobile gaming nowadays.

Erowid has a ton of stories about people who have ingested Datura. Most are unpleasant stories, of course. Apparently it's also difficult to dose, so it's pretty dangerous.

I mean, you can definitely sit here and say someone is a multi billionaire, but i would wager if you inherited a substantial sum of money and weren‚Äôt foolish, you‚Äôd be rich too. As an example (simple one but bear with me), a 1 million dollar investment in Microsoft in 1990 is worth 330 million dollars today. A 10M investment (which trump would have access to) is worth 3.3BN today. It‚Äôs all percentages and that‚Äôs the beauty of the market.

The kingdom of God includes heaven and earth.  The Kingdom, on earth as it is in heaven, which God had spoken by mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began concerned solely the land which had been promised to Abraham and his seed. Acts 3:20-21 KJV [20] And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: [21] Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.   The Gospel of the Kingdom, not the gospel of the kingdom of God, is the gospel Christ taught during His earthly ministry.  ‚ÄúThe kingdom is at hand.‚Äù  John the Baptist, Christ‚Äôs cousin, proclaimed it to Israel.  Christ taught it and chose the disciples to proclaim it.  The leaders of Israel rejected it.  In Acts 7 at the stoning of Stephen their offer was refused.  Now what?  How was the rest of the world going to be partakers of a kingdom if it didn‚Äôt happen?  A new/hidden gospel was introduced to the chief persecutor of the little flock which did accept the kingdom gospel.  Remember Saul of Tarsus?  On his way to Damascus with legal documents to continue his persecutions he had a significant emotional experience.  Paul the Apostle to the Gentiles had revealed to him by Christ from heaven a gospel which was new and hidden up to that point.  Romans 16:25 KJV [25] Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,   Notice the revelation of the mystery and how Paul calls it ‚Äúmy gospel?‚Äù  It‚Äôs also called the Gospel of Christ.  It‚Äôs not the same.  Did Christ tell the disciples to follow Paul‚Äôs gospel?  No.  It hadn‚Äôt been revealed to Paul until after Israel as a nation rejected their kingdom gospel.  The Gospel of the Grace of God was first revealed to and instituted by Paul.  Those that preach and teach the gospel of the kingdom today are doing a disservice to all.  They should heed the warnings scripture has.  Galatians 1:6-9 KJV [6] I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: [7] Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. [8] But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. [9] As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.  Today heaven is offered; not an earthly kingdom, to all individually without having to go through the nation Israel; by grace through faith in Paul‚Äôs Gospel.

I think it's only a matter of time until the younger generation takes over, and all these crazy old people die out. The problem we have today is not from the kids, teenagers or young adults, the problem we have is old people in power, holding back the generation below them from advancing and thus evolving into a better world. They're too stuburn to do things to make the living conditions we face today better because they're too busy with their head up the ass, making decisions in relation to the world THEY are used to.
If you are in a char crisis, I feel people being half ass to fix it isn't the way to go. Don't make it to be a 2-3 char pool to pick from. Keeping going through the cast, give it 2-3 days each to get a handle of their play style or something cool about them you can replicate and see if you want to stick with them. Also don't get intimidated with chars like Kaz needing stuff like WD/EWGF and character knowledge. Besides the character knowledge won't really become pivotal until you commit more to the game in which cases, you get it as well with experience. Execution can be improved with proper practice.   &amp;#x200B;  Take it from me. I started with Josie, went to Shaheen and as effective he was his style of play is kinda boring.  Touched a bit of Bob (could do it again if I can wrap my head on his mid range wavedash approach), Went to Anna (still trying with her) and ultimately ended up with AK. And I still want to try Marduk because he's got a similar well rounded play style but its crazy explosive with damage and Devil Jin because besides electrics, he has a well rounded kit. And I don't even need to be on point with electrics at low levels than relying on the rest of his kit for punishes.

Exilus Fray, human divination wizard. During his time as an academy student, he undertook a ritual with a group of friends, including his fianc√©. The spell, an altered version of Bigby‚Äôs hand went horribly awry, leaving Exilus the sole survivor as the the other‚Äôs souls were dragged absorbed by a giant ethereal hand.   After failing to have them resurrected, Exilus became obsessed with the concept of time travel, wishing to rewind to the moment of the accident and prevent it.  This is where things (hopefully) diverge. Exilus fails over and over again. The years stretch on, placing his goals further out of reach. His attempts become progressively more desperate as his sanity slips. Convinced that he‚Äôs living on a ‚ÄúFalse timeline‚Äù, he justifies heinous acts and spells in his pursuit. His friends and allies desert him. Finally, reaching the end of his natural lifespan, he becomes a lich to continue his research. Now he dwells in the magically fortified ruins of the academy where the accident took place, making occasional forays into the outside world to pursue leads on time travel. Those who encounter the lich claim to hear him absently muttering four names over and over again. The names of the friends he lost centuries ago.   You can easily have him come as a mid-late level stand-alone villain, or a secondary foe being manipulated by a larger threat.

*Her?*
Too proud for the beginner class, Taylor heads over to the right side of the arena. Besides, she likes the emphasis on attacking with a shield, rather than just defending. With her sword, shield, and armour, she looks around to see who else is there to partner up with.

I saw that stream as it happened. Murata showed more than he wanted to, but then he said it didn't matter since that was scrapped so he commented on it.  And of course ONE might change things, even big things for the future of the arc. ONE supposedly (according to Murata at least) decides a lot of what happens in every chapter just before writing it. He doesn't have a big plan for the overarching structure, and just lets himself improvise as he goes, which is why he couldn't tell Murata a lot about the new content, since he literally hadn't decided yet.

From your source:  &gt; Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns or gray towns, were all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practiced a form of segregation. I doubt Neil Gaiman or the mostly British crew knew enough about the particulars of that phrase to intend any offense by it.

Say what you want about Mikey Bustos, but his videos have reasonable production value. None of that echoey singing in an empty room sound. None of those lazy cuts. His videos have a theme and he executes.  Will always remember when I discovered that the channel my family was watching about ant keeping (AntsCanada) was Mikey Bustos. Mind=blown.

Probably just a personal paranoia on his part, which apparently doesn't really effect him if he still gets off from it.  I wouldn't concern yourself too much.  Next time you go down pay careful attention that you aren't scraping with your teeth or something (unless he asks for that i guess).  I doubt that's whats causing it, but who knows.

NTA NTA NTA  Do NOT allow anyone to judge you, not even your wife. She didn‚Äôt have to live your childhood and has no understanding of what having a parent like that is like.  I grew up with an addict that never showed remorse or understanding of what she did to her daughter. I have empathy for the addiction but not for her choices. She simply refused to admit anything was wrong and that if there was, it wasn‚Äôt her fault.  The day she died from finally drinking herself to death, was the best day of my life. I‚Äôm absolutely serious. She no longer would be able to hurt me any further and now all I had to do was work on repairing the old damage without worry of any new wounds.  Your mother is supposed to be the one person in this world that you loves you more than herself, but some of them don‚Äôt get that memo.

That exact thing happened to me my first playthrough. Boss had a magic pixel of health in the final phase, then Akihiko got charmed and cast Diarahan on the boss. I just sat there stunned.  On my second playthough, I came in with an Omnipotence Orb on MC, everyone else had that black void stone that nullifies status effects, and the Satan + Helel Armageddon combo in my pocket. Not falling for that one again bro!

No one said that. I don't think you understand what I did type. Perhaps English is hard for you? You were negative saying something is bad is expressing a negative attitude towards it. It's fine that your attitude is negative I just wish more people on a community forum dedicated to a game would actually have useful, constructive opinions. Instead of man this game sucks. Every person that uses Reddit for actually getting a useful opinion on a game is done a disservice by attitudes like yours. If you do not like the game at all anymore why are you here? That's my point. Please try to understand it.

This is very true. I'm not sure I agree with either side anymore. As I got older I started to care less about the so called "racism" accusations that come with being against immigration and looked at it more pragmatically in terms of what kind of country I wanna live in as far as demographics, language, etc. In most cases I am pretty indifferent to the culture wars. I do hate censorship and political correctness no matter who is doing it.

When I was a freshman in high school, I dropped a 45# plate on my right toe.  I had a pretty good feeling it wasn't broken, but it was pretty mashed.  I knew my dad wasn't going to pick me up, so I walked home on the side of my foot.  This was two weeks before my family was to go visit the mother land.  My dad got home, took one look at my toe, and immediately yelled, "if it's broken, you're not going!"  Didn't even ask if I was OK.   A couple years later, I came home from school to find my mom whacked out on cancer pain pills.  Possible suicide attempt?  Maybe.  She claims it wasn't.  Anyway, my dad yelled at me later that night because I, apparently, sent the ambulance to the wrong hospital.
Projection.
&gt;Yeah, it does. It explains your irrationality.  No it dosn't I'm quite rational.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Nobody was 'created'. We are merely part of an interdependent web of  life that forms complex yet fragile ecosystems. We choose to either  participate in the protection of these natural systems, or to destroy  them at our own peril.   So then why do men lack the reproductive organs capable of carrying a child to term and giving birth? And the very nature of birth is the combination of a fertile egg with sperm carrying preprogramed blue prints for lack of better term. That slowly takes nutrients from the mother's body as it divides it's cells over and over again following the programed blueprint to literally construct a human body from materials drawn from the human body.  If you know anything about the reproductive cycle then you know created is a very apt term for the process of human development in the womb.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Appeal to nature fallacy. Irrelevant. The fact is you have no  requirement (or right) to subject sentient beings to enslavement and  death.   Wrong logical fallacy appeal to nature only works if I claim that anything that is natural is better. For example assuming holistic medicine is better simply because it is natural.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal\_to\_nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature) I do not claim that eating meat is superior only that it is natural for us to eat meat.  &amp;#x200B;  The flip side of your argument is that you equally have no requirement or right to judge someone else for their actions. Yet you do because you see that argument is a two way street not just a one way were you get to stand on your soap box and declare others heathens and heretics for their actions to be burned at the stake.  This isn't Warhammer 40k and you are not the Inquisition.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; So if hitler won he would've been just and moral ? Gold star for mental gymnastics buds.   Were do I mention morality? I rather specifically dismiss morality from the situation looking at just basic facts.  Hitler is nothing more then one of a long line that continues to this day of people who have grabbed power and wiped out people who did nothing wrong but helps support their rule.  And frankly if your not even going to read what I post then there isn't much point to continue a conversation with you because you are only talking to yourself and not me.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I'm not 'morally...  So you are morally against it because there is no logic or independent ideas it is only morality is the only reason to do or not to do something. So by being against it you are morally against it.  It is always amusing how annoyed vegans tend to get when you use their own morality argument against them.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt; The concept ......  &amp;#x200B;  So your telling me deer don't eat plants and the wolves eat the deer?   Of Penguins and leopard seals swimming together and living together in harmony?  Do killer whales only target seals that are ass holes?   &amp;#x200B;  Morality is a human invention and it is a fluid creation that always changes from day to day, hour to hour and location to location. What was considered morally good 50 years ago is different then today and will be different in 50 years. What is considered morally good in the USA is different then what it would be considered in Japan. Morality isn't fact it can't be proven or dis-proven it is the equivalent of saying "God wants \_\_\_\_\_" Cultists who kill other people in the name of their cult are morally justified in their actions in their own head.  Religious fundamentalist who kill other people of the same religion who practice just slightly different religious services is morally justified to them.   I think they are all morally wrong but how does my morality over ride theirs? What aspect of my morality makes it better then theirs? Just because I believe in mine  and and I don't support theirs?  How do you awnser that statement that shows your morality is better then that of a cultist?  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; I never said they justified it - re-read...(maybe slowly if that helps?)   Ok  &gt;   Animals frequently rape each other but we don't try and justify rape  with the same logic? Your statement is directly saying that rape is acceptable and justified in nature.  Thus why we don't use it to justify when a human rapes another human.  If you meant anything else then you had poor word choice when writing that sentence.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; There's no humane way to forcibly take a life. Go watch some  slaughterhouse footage kid, this is a very naive thing to say. Painless  deaths aren't profitable.   Oh there absolutely is humane ways to take a life. Those slaughter house footage are often leaked examples of people not enforcing the rules they are suppose to follow. Much in the same way videos of police shooting unarmed individuals as they flee is examples of police not enforcing the rules they are suppose to follow.   &amp;#x200B;  Have you ever experienced  electronarcosis  before? Because the person who discovered it or at least made it public knowledge describes the experiences as like being in a dream unable to feel anything or move but still conscious. It was also often used in electroshock therapy to prevent patients from thrashing around during the treatment.  Science supports the statement and you only have opinions to claim other wise.  &gt; " Traditionally the definition for omnivory was entirely behavioral by  means of simply "including both animal and vegetable tissue in the diet"  [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/omnivore](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/omnivore)   Yes and the nature of science is that we developer greater understandings and thus change our views.   * Behavioral:  This definition is used to specify if a species or  individual is actively consuming both plant and animal materials.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:1-20)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-23) (e.g. "vegans do not participate in the omnivore based diet.") * Physiological:  This definition is often used in academia to specify  species that have the capability to obtain energy and nutrients from  both plant and animal matter.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-Reese-24)\[[*page¬†needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)\][\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:2-6)[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-:0-19)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivore#cite_note-25) (e.g. "humans are omnivores due to their capability to obtain energy and nutrients from both plant and animal materials.")  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; Cats need taurine - dogs can survive without any supplementation. Also - completely irrelevant.   If you are feeding them decent quality dog food or you are providing them fresh meat in the form of raw diet that includes not just the obvious red meat but also intestines and other organs that contain other trace elements not found in pure red meat.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt; The rest is an appeal to nature fallacy which is so incredibly boring  and receptively repeated by every idiot who tries to justify the  violence they pay for that I'm not going to bother to address it.   No it is based on the dietary requirements of a cat and dogs.  Go to any pet story and find a vegetarian dog food and check the protein, carb, etc list and it will be near identical to the meat based diets and a lot more vitamin supplements added into the diet. I worked in a pet store for 5 years after I got out of high school and while it wasn't common there was always at least one person a week who wanted a vegetarian diet for their dog and some times even cat.  which at that point I wonder why they didn't just get a rabbit since they are naturally herbivores.

Your BIOS (the operating system on the motherboard) will try to boot from each individual device (hard drive, USB thumb drive, CD/DVD/BD-ROM drive) in the order you set on it. So if you tell it to boot from Hard Drive A (your current Windows installation) and not Hard Drive B first (your old Windows installation) then it will boot from your current one.  In other words, it won't screw anything up just by connecting it.   That being said, you might have difficulty accessing the files on the other hard drive since they might be locked by the account on that version of Windows.

I wear a xl size glove and my PM2 feels a little small in my hand, but is still fun to play with and easy to carry.  I also have a Manix 2 XL.  It fits perfectly and feels very substantial, the jimping and the hook towards the back really lock in my grip.  It would be my choice to chop down a house.

Imagine the courage your lad had to work up to lay this on you. He didn't know if he was going to loose his dad in that moment. Before he told you he had played out every scenario but he couldn't shake the feeling that it could go so wrong.  He told you and your first response was good. Supportive, but then you took your support away a little bit by saying that there was a sadness for you. For you it was an after thought. For him it became everything. But it was just in the moment. It will pass.  Honestly this is nothing to worry about. You will have more challenging stuff than this to deal with. Show your son that you love him and support him, always. Everything else is just family.  Good luck buddy. We are with you.

This is called "flat damage", and it works like that:  &gt;Damage on equipment comes in two forms: Flat Damage and Percent Damage. Flat Damage applies only to your weapon attacks and does not increase the damage from your skills unless they include a % Weapon Damage component.   From the [Wiki on game mechanics](https://grimdawn.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Mechanics).  So, if you put that ring on your character, every weapon attack will now also do 10 bleeding damage over 5 seconds.
Top down balancing is the way to go. Balancing based on overleveling being assumed is a terrible idea, because that hurts the card in competitive. If anything the card being commonly overleveled points to the card being underpowered, as a player can only compete with the artificially inflated stats. Having a viable card overleveled will rapidly boost trophies

Lack of liquidity means death for low/negative EBITDA companies that need new debt to float which are generally correlated with growth companies.  Value companies generally have a cash cow that prints money.  The cow may print less money in a recession but that's better than a growth company that relies on the capital markets to survive.
&gt; instead imo they accept things like adblocker and build ads into their content in moral and ethical ways that synergize with their brand and content.  What they do is make people who don't use adblockers watch two ads.

That might be true if the politians who whine about mental health after a mass shooting didn't turn around and immediately gut the mental health care system the second people stop paying attention.   Also, mentally ill people are not inherently violent and are many times more likely to be the *victims* of violence, so only talking about mental health care in the context of stopping mass shooters contributes to the toxic stigma mentally ill people face.

What's your use case?  Mini PCI-e slots can carry many different  signals  (USB2, USB3, I2C, UART, SATA, etc.). Few manufactures document what's actually wired up.   USB should be wired up given that the original [EM7455 WWAN](https://www.sierrawireless.com/products-and-solutions/embedded-solutions/products/em7455/) module for the x260 communicates over USB3.0.  AFAIK BIOS whitelisting is only a thing with WiFi cards.
Well, that's life. I gave up on that and met a nice girl on reddit. But that took about a year of posting. Online dating as a dude is basically just a crapshoot.
I am not trying to achieve anything here. Looks like I don't have near the knowledge you have just bad experience with no SWAP.  But on the Anaconda situation (as all installation wizards: YaST, Debian Installer, etc), at least in my opinion, should be doing that automatically then. Since people wouldn't be aware of the swap situation the automatic partitioning should do the correct one, anything else would be through the advanced/custom partitioning.  I guess to implement that...calculation would be trivial and would be the recommendation that'd cover the not the majority, but all users. And observing what openSUSE people did with the BTRFS root partition and subvolumes implementation (Richard Brown's BTRFS playground :) ), it mustn't be trouble, just forgotten to be implemented. I try to propose it, actually.  Cheers

I wonder if you and many others in this thread are genuine in their accusations of rape or sexual assault. If you truly believe a 16 year old having sex with "an extremely attractive woman of 22" is a sexual assault against the 16 year old, despite OP not even hinting a thing in that direction, then why are you talking about it in such a pedestrian way?  If you believe in your accusation, then why are you not calling for that woman to go to jail? And if you are not prepared to do that, why bother calling it a sexual assault in the first place?  Also I have to wonder, how is a woman who went through all the difficulties of pregnancy by herself, and is presumably a single mother, who also by looks of it should know the family would not press charges, who did not ask for child support, not be entirely in the right to unilaterally decide who does or does not have a relationship with her daughter?  Being a sperm donor does not necessarily entitle or condemn you to fatherhood.

No you would not be going through classes. Only apprentices will be going to class through the training center. When I applied I tested then interviewed. They then recommended that I take some classes on my own and when I got either 16 hours of class time or 100 hours of documented experience, I could reapply for an interview. This was for local 38 in Cleveland Ohio. I interviewed 4 times and was on the list a year and a half. I just got accepted as an apprentice and started working last week. No class date has been set yet for my apprenticeship.

I don't know but I've had accounts shadow banned that eventually got out of it over time.   Instagram doesn't have any real interest in banning accounts because their business model is based on advertising so I think what they do is put accounts in limbo for a while if they perceive it to be spammy.   If over time you don't exhibit spammy behaviour your account goes back to normal. How long this waiting period is? Only Instagram will know but it doesn't seem to be permanent.

Hi. It‚Äôs because NULL is implementation defined. Sometimes it‚Äôs defined as 0. This causes problems in C++ if you‚Äôre using overloaded or tempalated functions which take an int or a pointer. If NULL is 0, the int function might be called or instantiated. So C++ defines a nullptr_t type to mitigate that.

You know, Show Jaime... Show Jaime might actually work with this quote.  See, we all thought Jaime killed Aerys to protect the innocent, but didn't Ned say " You served him... when serving was easy.

So really, did Jaime kill Aerys to defend the innocents or to avoid having to kill ( try to kill ) his dad?

Ah, got it.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt have an explanation to share based on the described circumstances, but blackholing also seems like a different problem from rejections - but I don‚Äôt want to make things up, so no answer here.  I could speculate that it‚Äôs possible that past abuse originating from same AWS IPs may have prompted receiving servers to enforce authentication (speculation), but that would be very unusual.  It may explain partial/intermittent success (which may depend on which instance sent the message), but TBH I don‚Äôt know AWS that well - so my assumptions about them rotating IPs is completely speculative as well, and enforcing presence of SPF authentication based on IPs is also very unusual - none of the major bigname ESP servers that I managed did that (in terms of rejections for not having domain records for SPF authentication).  Blackholing is a heavy handed solution aimed at large scale spam abuse, and I‚Äôm assuming you are not a spammer. If you are, that could explain the situation a bit better :) but I don‚Äôt judge while off duty ;)  Wish I could give you answers, but your situation does seem quite odd.

Dude!  Where was this when I was in college for that library dungeon time lol
Aww, shit, I have some great memories of times in there - normally the Saturday afternoon music sessions. Pints of ale, Blueswamp, Haggis, Mojo Hand. Dave Wyatt, so many, many blurry memories.  Kinda stopped going a couple years ago after there was some half-assed refurb in the music room. Really killed the vibe when the bar on that side closed and they put in the copper kettle stuff.   Last time I was in, there were paper signs announcing the toilets as a gender-free zone. Which was different I guess, but the feminine hygiene disposal box things were only in the "gender-free-toilets-that-used-to-be-female" stalls.   Shame to see it go, but it had been going downhill for a while.  Edit: F

It was way too big though and was rubbing against my abdominal wall and causing a lot of pain. It was also technically a paratubal cyst so it was inside my fallopian tube.  So now I‚Äôm down a tube but I also lost a few inches off my waist!

I was in Kyushu in early April. Full Sakura blooms, felt very lucky to see that. Obviously the well-traveled parts of Japan-Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, etc- are popular for a reason, but wow is Kyushu beautiful.   Without exaggeration, I think I saw a grand total of 5 western/european tourists in 6 days there, and most of them I saw in one day at Yufuin. Definitely off the beaten path for most people visiting Japan it seems. And nowhere (except Yufuin) was crowded. At all. A dream come true compared to Tokyo.  &amp;#x200B;  I rented a car and drove around northern Kyushu for 6 days. Easily the best driving road trip of my life. You get used to driving on the opposite side pretty quick, believe it or not. And zero traffic on the highways out there, just you and unbelievably gorgeous scenery.

Well. It is your sisters problem anyways. And not yours. From an good ethical perspective. I would suggest you to console your sister emotionally and try to drip some sense into her about taking care of herself. Slowly but eventually. You cannot protect her forever. And you cannot trust her alone with anyone else either.  As for you . I would say, Relying on logic can never bring you harm. If you know what is right for you and your family;And when and how much you should act upon it accordingly, so that it benefits all and harms none. I kinda messed up with my wordings i hope u understand :)

Some guys do have more trouble in general than others, but I wouldn't assume that's the case seeing as he'd had a drink. That's a common side effect alcohol can have on guys. Your ex may have just been one of the few that wasn't as affected after a drink.  I wouldn't be too concerned about whether a guy willingly sleeping with you isn't attracted enough to you for that to be the problem. We're pretty simple creatures, and our dicks are even simpler haha.

18 years married in August.  Met when we were 16.  To be honest, it has been a lot of work at times.  Three kids, both of us working.  My schedule is crazy.  We were really put to the test when we lost her Mother.  It was over about a 4 month period, and there were many weekend trips to the hospital 3 hours away.  I stayed home with the kids and changed my schedule around to make it work.  After it was over there was a long grieving period for her, this took the most toll on us.  We have always been really close and at that time we were so far separated I wasn't sure we would be able to get it back.  It took a lot of talking and sharing and a new commitment between the two of us.   &amp;#x200B;  You will always be tested, but if you are willing to put in the work, you just make it happen.

‚ÄúAn accurate depiction of UK's Gawker-media interpretation of Carl Benjamin.‚Äù Also,  it‚Äôs a Gawker media interpretation to observe an upsurge of white supremacy in Europe?

&gt; Responsible developers and engineers don't release designs with viable vulnerabilities, at least without warning about them  If you really feel that way, we are not in disagreement at all  &gt; Cryptocurrencies are one of the only pure free markets around  And again, we are in full agreement, except maybe that i'd claim that it's near impossible to trade cryptocurrencies freely or anonymously in the real world. But it is a romantic thought i can align with nevertheless.   &gt; and CMC has been around almost as long as BTC.  Here we seem to disagree. Just because it has been around a long time doesn't mean it actually carries any valuable information, especially while no-one is able to verify it, which is kind of hilarious considering we are in a space where everything revolves around data immutability

Am I the only one who thinks he needs to give up on trying to develop post moves (let's be real, at this level if he hasn't developed a touch near the basket it probably will never happen) and focus on shooting threes? There has been more success for Bigs with limited inside game learning to shoot threes than there are bigs who have developed amazing inside games late into their careers. Adding a three would really help out the offense.

You don't have to have a gun every time you leave the house, but it's like seatbelts, you don't need it 99.99% of the time, but if you need it, you're really gonna want to have it.   Coming up on your second point, a majority of mass shootings do happen in gun free zones, which is where they get their point from.   Gun owners (that aren't fudds) feel that any kind of reform, will lead to more reforms that will eventually lead to bans, or even more infringement on their second amendment. Which they also believe that the second defends the rest of the amendments, which is why some people are so amendment about it not being touched.   In a time where we have people like Trump and other people that the general populous doesn't trust/like/think are acting in the best interest of their country. The people of the USA should be able to keep firearms IN CASE (HHUUUUUGEE in case) they should have to fight a tyrannical government or defend themselves from someone attacking them or someone who can't defend themselves.  Trying to remain as unbiased as possible, please let me know how I'm doing, and I'm always open to conversation.

i'm confused... is that a camino or a ranchero?
Absolutely. If was in an LTR with a good girl and one day out of curiosity i decide to vet her through the system only to find out she was taking slabs of meat through all her holes on camera i would definitely downgrade lmao. I don't think it will necessarily reduce thot activities since society encourages women to "empower" themselves by whoring out during their youth. It would however probably just end up reducing marriages and LTRs a bit (they've been fading out anyways)
And sports.
No, no, you got it wrong. The shows unnecessarily interrupt the ads.

The Sheriff has jurisdiction over the entire county, including all of Oakland. I'm not sure what you mean when you say they only serve a fraction of Oakland's population.
I really like your voice! Your tone and control is excellent. You have a tendency to slide between notes, which definitely works for your style. My only advice is to get your intonation perfect for this as it‚Äôs easy to slide a little too far, or for that matter, not far enough and land slightly flat or sharp. Try singing through the notes very separately to get the intonation perfect and then go back to singing it normally. The only other pointer I can think of is diction - try to pronounce the harder consonant sounds a little more and make them crisp. I really like how you sound though and it‚Äôs definitely a good basis for the future!

**HELP! Camera Issue - Sony A6500 - Radial Glare in Photos**   I've had my Sony A6500 since Jan. 2017. Recently, I've been noticing that my pictures have a radial glare through the center of them. In order to try and fix this, I updated my firmware to the latest version and had the sensor professionally cleaned. Neither of these resolved the issue. The glare happens regardless of which lens I use. The glare is more dominant on solid colors such as the sky. (See Photo Below)  Sony quoted me $389 to have the camera looked at. The camera has never been dropped or had any accidents. Has anyone else experienced this? Any recommendations? I really don't want to have to pay $400 to have the camera repaired. But, I don't know what else to do. Any help or advice is welcomed.  &amp;#x200B;  Photo:  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rp45AM2pipaGracP9iiGrYbfQUp8jtuJ/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rp45AM2pipaGracP9iiGrYbfQUp8jtuJ/view)

Sword users who are good characters:  1. Kirito. Of course, who else could be number one? He is *the* black swordsman. Master of the holding-two-swords technique give it up for the legendary hero of Aincrad that all other anime swordsmen look up to, *KIRITOOOOO!!!!*  2. Swords Guy from the anime Sword Gai. One of the most epic anime swordsmen to ever be in an anime. He revolutionised swordsmen in anime by not actually being a real sword user at all. Iirc he, like, lost his arm in an accident and the retarded doctor didn't know what to do so he taped a sword to his body and said it was his new arm.. or something? I dunno, that show is a big blur to me. But regardless, Swords Guy is a truly cool sword user in anime.   3. Edward Elric-Kun from the hit anime Hagane no Renkinjutsushi. This dude is cool because like, alright he also lost his arm right? But instead of just having a sword arm now he has like some kind of metal arm that when he casts his hocus pocus magic spells upon he can actually transform into a deadly blade that he can use to compete with other anime swords users.   4. Saber from the anime we all know and love Fate/Stay Zero Last Apocrypha. She's cool because unlike other anime swordsmen, she wields a sword that is invisible to the eye.. so like, yeah. 5. Asuna from Kirito Art Offline.   The end.
Man there's a lot of triggered snowflakes on the left, lol

Marxism-Leninism is still relevant to the modern world, I don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt believe it is.   My impression is that you consider all of these sects of socialists as irrelevant therefore we should drop labels and just focus on good old fashion socialism. But of course the question is how do you differ from all these other factions? Do you consider yourself above all this petty infighting? Is everyone dumb except for you?  Yes it‚Äôs easy to say the only thing that matters is organizing. But as Zizek would say (from quoting someone else) ‚Äúokay that works in practice but does it work in theory?‚Äù   Basically what you seem to be saying is that we should abandon theory (the root of all these sects ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù to the modern age) which is of course ridiculous. Sounds like some Eduard Bernsteinite bullshit.  I understand yes, we shouldn‚Äôt be letting our views of obscure historical events get in the way of a new political project. BUT, how we view those certain historical events is important, if you look at the disagreements it‚Äôs about important fundamental questions (ie. what does it mean to be socialist, to what extent is nationalism good, etc).
They use [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html?highlight=process) which takes a function and a list of parameters and executes that function in multiple processes in parallel. Those parameters are passed to the new processes using [pickling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). That limits the types of data you can pass. Based on this code, it seems like you can't pickle boto3 sessions and that's why they create a new session in each process in the `getMetrics()` function.  To use profiles all you have to do is pass the profile to the session constructor.   boto3.Session(profile_name="myprofile", region_name=instance["Placement"]["AvailabilityZone"][:-1])  If you want to use multiple profiles, maybe you can pass the profile name to `getMetrics()` as a parameter.  It seems like `p_mode` is part of an incomplete feature that allows querying multiple accounts. The code checks if it's `"single"` and if not it prints an error.  I'm not sure what you mean by "session name", but if you mean using a different profile, then yes, those are the two lines you want to change. Note that `getInstances()` is called in the main process and `getMetrics()` is called in the worker processes.
Whisper of the heart was boring as fuck though.

It is a good build against passive lanes since you'll be getting a Luden's for just 2500 gold, and you should be able to close it around minute 8-10.   Just remember you will have a Summoner's disadvantage in lane, and that you can possibly tilt your jungler if you get too many chicken camps.
SO happy my friend gave me her login.  You're allowed X-number of devices.  Mine was one of her allowances. I gave her my Hulu. My great friend got my Movies Anywhere login--something like 200 movies. It's allowed.  To a point.
Think of it this way, you've already experienced something truely torturous like this so for the rest of your life small bouts of pain won't seem bad at all, plus you'll probably have a cool little scar/story!
Here it goes!
remember ice used to eat this straight up raw by the spoon, the cadmium probably went to his brain and destroyed it
Is that really the same when you consider that the Thalmor actively try to prolong the war, by interfering with Ulfric's execution at Helgen?  And also, the Stormcloaks never even attempted a peaceful negotiation, Ulfric just went and stabbed his sworn liege and plunged the country into a civil war. Only to promptly be captured in a matter of months.
&gt; Obama, Lynch, Comey, Mueller??  There is zero evidence any of these people you mention are connected to any corruption or illegal activity. Fox News conspiracy theories aren't reality.  Donald Trump and his family however are known to be operating a criminal enterprise through government corruption. And Trump is directly connected to Jeffery Epstein.
To be honest I can‚Äôt tell them apart either, so I can‚Äôt say that I blame them.
I suspect with how good mine is it'll be as good if not still better than the next generation of consoles. That still won't stop me from doing my possibly overkill upgrade over the summer. Then in that case it'll beat out the next 3 generations of consoles ;) Ok probably not but it'll be powerful.
What, by making the same moves that he advises Dave to make everyday?
How much for that 3 üåü armored combat shotgun? dRG662 add me

It's all fun and games until somebody gets a downvote.
I agree way more flowers!!

They do that in the US, too. Go research any of the deaths.
I hope you can have some kinda pet
Lol once the molvi smacked the back of my head so bad that I almost performed a somersault. This was when I made a mistake while reciting Quran, *Peacefulness Intensifies*.
That fight was a banger too.
He was just plain mean and condescending to everyone.
Everyone that makes these memes had to post it somehow.
Bruno if she wasn't wearing shoes then that lady is actually a man.  "She" is at hermit park almost daily
...you didn't want to use "Madrid?"
Why did you wait 20 minutes then? I think you know why.
...and?
Still doubt  top 1-11 will drop only shakeup's gonna be with Ehome's slot
NTA, but it depends if you think the woman he's hitting need the help fending off a creepy older guy. If you for even a second think they do, strike him down like a thunderbolt thrown by Zeus himself.

It's more fun without context! Lol

That is presumably what the aggressors are for.
I think we‚Äôre trying to get a group together in Stack‚Äôd in Oakland for tomorrow‚Äôs game
Oh okay then, that says a lot about her lmao.
You're welcome!
I was just hashing this over with my imaginary friends and we think it's like this:   Anyone who's happy to be an American, is gonna make sure you're happy to be here too. Visit us again soon! (the real us, not my imaginary us's.)

Well, he willed his own suffering, as St Thomas said, and all the sins of the world were laid on him as he experienced the Father's turning from him.  We couldn't fathom that since we are not fully God and in full union with the Father as a person of the Trinity.

Muy interesantes todos vuestros post. Me encanta por fin un debate sin acritud, con exposiciones francas, diversas pero alejadas del consabido "este tiene que irse" o "aquel ha fracasado y es el √∫nico responsable", en fin gracias. Ahora voy a tratar de aportar mi granito de arena.  Nuestros documentos tasan que y c√≥mo se consulta, que quien y como convoca la asamblea y me parece que este es un momento crucial para no experimentar soluciones improvisadas o fuera de lugar. Hay tiempo y ya nos hemos maltratado bastante delante de nuestros enemigos como para darles m√°s chances en medio de la negociaci√≥n de un gobierno que solo queremos nosotros o una parte de nosotros.  Tenemos que hacer un cuidadoso an√°lisis de los resultados de esta marat√≥n electoral donde part√≠amos como perdedores en todas las encuestas encaminadas a fortalecer la premisa de que era indispensable el voto √∫til para defendernos de un problema que en Andalucia lleg√≥ al 10% y sin embargo los medios lo presentaron como si fueran mayor√≠a absoluta. Yo no soy capaz de profundizar mucho. Pero mi peque√±a aportaci√≥n es que:   Las confluencias decidieron, salvo los comunes dejarnos, la primera compromis, que se atribuyeron en exclusiva la obtenci√≥n del grupo parlamentario en la anteriores y arrastraron en estas a las mareas, pues parece que los √∫nicos que leyeron bien los resultados de 2015/16 fueron los comunes pues ninguna obtuvo grupo propio.   Los resultados de Errej√≥n nos ha sido vendido como la verificaci√≥n de que su tesis es la correcta y que ese es el camino simplificando unos resultados que en mi opini√≥n tienen una segunda lectura, dejar√© a un lado la utilizaci√≥n en campa√±a de medios pagados por podemos para usarlos luego contra podemos e ir√© a las cifras concretas:   El resultado de m√°s Madrid en la comunidad m√°s los resultados de podemos no s√≥lo est√°n por debajo de los resultados de podemos en las generales de este a√±o sino que tambi√©n est√°n por debajo de la suma de podemos e IU en 2015, me gustar√≠a saber si esto era el aporte que traer√≠a √ç√±igo, de aquellos que √©l dec√≠a que faltan y que s√≥lo √©l era capaz de atraer. Parece que al final no les era atractivo cambiar solo las personas, para eso no merece la pena el riesgo a que otra vez te dejen por imb√©cil al votar una cosa y que te den otra por que la realidad se impone.  En fin siento el tocho, gracias por vuestra comprensi√≥n  Salud os

This is probably because a lot of women find men on attractive on an emotional scale,  physicality counts too but not in the same way men see it. Ever notice attractive women dating guys who "accordingly" aren't that attractive or just plain average? It's their conference, personality and emotional side that's attractive. and that's why there isn't as many sub redits of naked men.   Ask a lot of women and see if they find penises  attractive? Most won't. Ask.a guy if he finds women's  vaginas attractive and in sure you know that answer.

Limiting the campaign in any way to reduce carbon is a sucker's game.  Carbon isn't taxed in the US because Republicans hold pretty much all government power.  So that means if you use less gas, that only lowers the price of gas and the same gas gets used by someone else. In other words, by limiting their carbon use, Democrats would just be making it cheaper for Republicans to operate their campaigns and pass more policies that accelerate global warming.  It would actually be far more likely to increase emissions in the long run.

&gt;Free Trade is a fool‚Äôs pursuit as long as U.S. trade adversaries engage in the same mercantilist practices that China is guilty of practicing.  That conclusion doesn't follow from your premise. Don't you know who actually pays tarrifs? Every American who wants a good from a foreign company does. The cost to the foreign country is secondary considering that, to them, we're only part of their foreign market, but to us, we're *all* of our part of their foreign market. Tariffs only prop up businesses that our workforce has matured out of. They benefit those *few* businesses at the expense of the *many* people not in those businesses, and at the expense of all the new businesses we don't go into because our workforce is sitting in these government protected ruts.  It would be nice if other countries let our companies sell products in their land without tariffs, but the cost of domestic tariffs in retaliation is greater than the cost of foreign tariffs against us. Trump has not, that I've seen, used hiking tariffs as a bargaining lever to lower tariffs unilaterally. In fact he's consistently referred to free-er trade agreements like NAFTA as bad deals. It's one of the few things he's actually been consistent on verbally.  Making the right economic trade-offs for an economy as large and varied as ours, is not the simple result of mirroring the policies of countries that are both developmentally behind us, and completely different from us culturally and politically.
**Censorship doesn't help anyone. Right now, in this sub, if you want to talk about government you can't. If you want to talk about prisons you must not bring up politicians who are responsible for it. I wrote a long post yesterday that I put a lot of thought into about the military in this country (the US) and it got auto removed. And I had to write this post this way because criticizing the sub is not allowed. Maybe this IS unpopular, and maybe the rules work well, but the point of this sub (in my opinion) is that we get to discuss things that may be taboo or wouldn't be brought up otherwise. It advances the conversation where there wouldn't have been one to begin with. Don't stuff those opinions in a megathread or ban them outright. It's censorship, and it's bullshit.**

Cool, let's go through these.  I got through about half, before questioning whether you'd read them as thoroughly as I did, or were just shotgunning links.   I should note that I never claimed BMI is *the most* accurate method of estimating body fat; only that it is surprisingly good at it. It is particularly well suited for diagnosing obesity.  **Article 1:** The most it does is state that "some people are healthy with other BMIs." This is true; 5% of men and 1% of women would indeed constitute "some". It argues that, because BMI is old, and simple to calculate, that this somehow makes it less accurate, when the article I sent debunks this. Neither age nor simplicity make a diagnostic tool inherently less accurate. The article lends quite a lot of focus to potential outliers of BMI, without once mentioning the prevalence of said outliers.   "One problem with BMI is that it does not distinguish between muscle and fat." No shit, Sherlock. The whole point of BMI is to estimate a body fat range.   **Article 2:** Again, yes, there are more accurate methods of estimating body fat (like the ones I recommended for you).   "For example, a person with exceptional muscle tone and low fat is more likely to have a higher BMI compared to someone with higher fat and lower muscle tone..." Interesting how all of these articles choose to mention this end of BMI's inaccuracy, when it the opposite is usually true: A person with a normal BMI who, in reality, has excess body fat. I particularly like how this article chooses to mention that "many professional football players' BMIs would place them in the obese category", as though professional athletes are analogous to the average adult.   The article fails to cite the study which supposedly concludes "Nearly half of those whose BMIs labeled them as overweight were actually healthy, according to data on their other health measures." What other health measures? How many of them did a subject have to pass in order to be considered "healthy" or "unhealthy"? Did the article examine the correlation with actual body fat percentage, or just try to argue that being overweight wasn't unhealthy?  **Article 3:**  I like how this article is titled "How Accurate Is Body Mass Index, or BMI?", yet never answers its own question. This one also uses professional athletes (Michael Jordan!) as an example of extreme outliers, implying this could somehow be the norm. Mostly, though, this is just a few recommendations for further action a person can take, *in addition to* looking at their BMI.   **Article 4:**  Titled "How Accurate is BMI?" with a sub-heading of "Is BMI reliable as an indicator of body fat?", this page also fails to answer both questions. It instead describes, in vague and relative terms, where outliers can exist. It gives zero statistics for their prevalence.   "...which is why muscular athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscle rather than additional body fat." I'm noticing a trend here.   **Article 5:** "Why BMI Isn‚Äôt The Best Measure for Weight (or Health)" (I never said it was), cites a study which found the following: "Among the study participants, about half of women who were not classified as obese according to their BMI actually were obese when their body fat percentage was taken into account. Among the men, in contrast, about a quarter of obese men had been missed by BMI." This supports my point.   The article concludes with: "So without a viable way to change how we measure body fat, for now, BMI is the best option." It also mentions other tests which should be paired with this estimate to give a bigger picture of overall health. No argument there; completely reasonable.   &gt;just pointing out that I'm not obese by any stretch of the imagination.   You're obese by a remarkably accurate estimation. Prove me wrong, by a more accurate measurement. And, if your doctor knows with such certainty that you're not obese, what measurement did *he* use to determine that?

Probably when we were innocent. But that rises the question: can we still consider ourselves the same person?
You go Emma!!! She‚Äôs a cutie pie, sending healing vibes your way little one.
[Title 18 of the United States Code](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_18_of_the_United_States_Code) defines international terrorism as activities that ‚Äî  (A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; (B) appear to be intended ‚Äî (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum"  In 2016, a US-backed Saudi coalition was found to have [bribed members of Al Qaeda](https://www.apnews.com/f38788a561d74ca78c77cb43612d50da) to ‚Äúsecure victories‚Äù against them. The clear motive of such actions was to increase favorability with the Yemeni population and its government, opening the populace up to exporting oil and buying American products. This act alone defines the US as an ‚Äòinternational terrorist‚Äô under its own law:  ‚ÄúAct dangerous to human life‚Äù - bribing a group that has killed and continues to kill innocent civilians is most definitely dangerous to human life  ‚ÄúViolation of the criminal laws of the United States‚Äù - providing support for Al Qaeda is a [violation of the PATRIOT act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providing_material_support_for_terrorism)   ‚ÄúIntended to influence the policy of a government‚Äù - increasing support of the Yemeni government by ‚Äúridding‚Äù villages of Al Qaeda to make them more economically friendly toward the US  ‚ÄúOccur primarily outside the US‚Äù - the bribery took place in Yemen.  The US defines itself as an international terrorist.  Get fucked kid
Gotcha.  We're in Chicago region and I was like WTF?
Great show and amazing acting.
Yeah was never released here! Crazy hey. Gonna cook up a couple grams I think, is it snortable if it‚Äôs pure or oral only?
uhh x was killed in broad daylight while trying to leave a motorcycle store. I don‚Äôt really know how that‚Äôs a bad idea, but whatever.
So that person was joking haha, to help you out more I'd do a 10-15% increase over maintenance.  For example if your maintenance is 2000 eat 2200-2300. I'd try 2200 and see how much you gain in the first week, aim for a pound a week (first week it's okay if it's more cause it'll be water weight/glycogen)   I'm also 5'4ish at 127lb kinda shredded and I'm bulking on 2500-2600.
Looks good...
Call the cops. This is criminal.
Happily they are not Cuban cigars.  Still banned in U.S..

They just spammed propaganda and banned his videos.
Hello Carl. Before you‚Äôre gone, I just wanted to say that you are amazing. I will remember forever Carl, thank you.
Bye bye wearing trainers
False. The kids usually stay with grandma on the weekends, while Mom is making the next sibling for grandma to take care of.
Hope i get picked!
That's my point. Trump is just claiming exec privilege over horse shit level justification such as his taxes. Or the mueller report.   He is abusing the sheer concept.
Honestly after Andromeda AND Anthem back to back if you STILL buy Dragon Age.....you really haven't learned anything
Nice! You think so? I was on vacation for a couple days and it stormed (weirdly, it doesn't usually rain here this close to summer) but I didn't notice it until a week or so later.  What would you suggest doing? Obviously not water it. Anything to make it look a less bit ill? You think the red/brown will fade? (not the holes but the actual coloring of the surrounding)
NTA. Absolutely talk to him about it in the best way you think you can. Maybe not call him out, but definitely try to have a private conversation or if you don't feel comfortable, talk to a manager or your boss about it.
It got retconned
It‚Äôs nice to see people who don‚Äôt live in Wisconsin protesting Walker:)
Woohoo, I made it through a whole week for another episode!!
What would happen if you went a few days without?

I think they look best in plum myself, I tried some of the tacticool stuff for a few weeks, but couldn't bring myself to keep it. After I put plum on her I've never wanted her any other way. Not to mention I think the plum handguard feels better in the hand.
Allegri?
first of all: Thanks for sharing your add-on!  if you are on linux you could use the FOSS chromium ... Maybe also interesting: [AnkiWebView Inspector](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/31746032) (but as far as I see it doesn't help for previews).

So you haven‚Äôt even been to Skid Row by the sound of it.
I have a theory that someone pass down bad info (possibly the royal family to prevent them from getting too strong) and blonde hair and green eyes are not a sign of strong blood but instead white hair and purple eyes like the MC's are a sign so they've been unknowingly weakening their bloodline like the idiots they are.
Agreed but look at the stores IG page.  Everything looks like it's from JCP/Sears catalog '95 women's section. Amy can't dress her damn self. Amy's just playing with owning a store.
When I was in college we had to take a few ‚Äúexplorations‚Äù classes to graduate. Basically meant to broaden your knowledge of things outside your major. So cultural studies or film, etc. I chose a class on disabilities. Mostly because I didn‚Äôt know anyone with disability and it covered a wide range of topics.   Anyway, we covered both epilepsy and traumatic brain injury in the class.   The most important thing to remember in situations like this is that your skate video will suck ass if it isn‚Äôt shot with a fisheye lens.
Thank you for the request, comrade.  u/nugget2233 has not said the N-word yet.

I agree with this.   I I started as an end-user for a short time. Basic admin stuff. No scripting knowledge, only really doing things like form configurations, KB articles/management, building reports, workflows, and catalog items. I got a job as a junior TC at a gold partner just over three years ago and started learning as fast as I could. It felt like drinking from a fire hose. I got poached by a bronze partner about a year ago and went from junior to mid-level with a big pay increase. I feel like I‚Äôve barely been doing this very long at all, but I‚Äôve learned a ton, gotten a few certs, and am now a certified instructor for SNOW. You really can move up incredibly fast if you put the work in.   I can‚Äôt agree more with what /u/theRealPancakeMix said about the time management stuff. Making the jump from end-user to partner took a lot of getting used to. The pace is a lot faster and more demanding, at least in my experience.   Also, if you have web dev experience and like doing that sort of thing, I highly recommend learned as much about portal as you can and getting those skills up. There‚Äôs a constant shortage of folks who are good at portal and you‚Äôll be in higher demand.
"Russia said they didn't... a lot of people said they didn't do it. Maybe they did. Maybe it was a fat guy in a basement somewhere. They could have been helping Crooked Hillary to ... they didn't want me to win, why would they have helped me? Everyone says I'm doing a great job with Russia. Everyone. Putin knows I'm tough with... the toughest. Maybe the toughest ever. You think Low IQ Joe could be that tough? Kim Jong Un and I respect each other and we have great trade relations with North Korea. The best."
I would totally were this tho I don't think its that cringe
Everything else except for T55AM has a shorter reload, the damage is still lower than its competition, the pen is also lower than the competition. Therefore below average
Hmm I thought it was quite wholesome tbh
I think it's good in general to not be toxic to people's opinions that differ with your own, especially with things like entertainment.   I personally was hyped for this movie and didn't care much for it but I'm seeing a lot of fans are liking it and although I'm in disagreement to some of their opinions on it, I am not mad at them for liking it.   I'm actually glad that they're enjoying it because it really sucks when something is released for people to be entertained by and they then aren't. And it sucks to be bashed by toxic fans as either a creator, film critic, or even just a fellow fan.   It's all just opinions and movies should be fun but if their not, let's not get so caught up in anger and toxicity. It's not helping anybody or convincing anyone that your thoughts are more valid then theirs that way
Dude, chill. All of my friends (including myself) are the same way. I‚Äôm out in Miami, so I‚Äôm surrounded by beauty on a daily basis. What‚Äôs helped (and call me every name in the book) is no-wank, No-wank is something Gavin Mccines talks about, and it really changes the way you approach life(from talking and being nice to random people, dancing in the shower, and talking to every hot girl) with no fear. Start the no wank diet and you‚Äôll never regret it.

That's because you're ignorant about language and culture.
You can listen to them on any media player. After downloading, open on Quicktime, VLC, etc.
Good luck man! That was a real grind for me
Not to me
I'm not so sure that they put jokes in official Government warning messages.
Take the simplest thing you can think of, a bolt for example, and go ask somebody to produce one of them. You'll be astonished at the cost. A basic 10mm bolt, for example, could easily cost $1000 between producing a drawing and having a machine shop fabricate it. More if you want it roll formed.  Small airplanes don't get to enjoy the economy of mass production like cars do. The very first Nissan Versa probably cost a few million $ to build and got cheaper from there.
