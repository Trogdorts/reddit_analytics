You want to get the inner tub separated from the drive block (part that the spanner nut threads onto). Usually lifting up (2 people is best) and tap down on the drive block with a hammer or sledge hammer. Drive block is fairly cheap so don't worry if it gets damaged, just try not to get the transmission shaft.
Wow it looks great

They truly felt that it was a great idea to make use of underutilized resources worldwide and in particular the privacy foundation will revolutionize decentralized grid computing and ease many concerns. 
It is your self esteem.

No, that was once they entered the middle, the red line is the armor line. I imagine this was done to permanently put an end to dual laning strats.
voice acting and some half\-assed bonus content. If it's your first time you may as well go for it, but I don't think there's much reason to rush out and buy if if you've played the original.  oh and they made it so you're insanely poor all the time for some reason.

Faith based reasoning by definition means it cannot be proven or disproven, hence the need for "faith". However, it can be proven that the Earth is not flat if you have ever seen the horizon or flown in a plane. Flat earth conspiracy is NOT a real conspiracy. Real conspiracies usually have people that stand to gain something. It's easy to discourage anything that might seem shady by comparing it to flat earth theory.
If it was they made it very believable. 
Ya I agree about Lynch I'm stoked he's back with the silver and black for another season. He deserves more credit then he got last season, if you watch the game tape from the titans game in week 1 and the last half of the season dude is still a boss. One thing thats for sure is Gruden wants to pound the rock. With the signing of a true blocking full back, two blocking tight ends, and the focus on big offensive lineman he wants to straight up run through people. I am still worried about our ability to cover tight ends and running backs out of the backfield with the current stable of linebackers we have (even if bowman resigns not his strong suit), but other than that I like where we are going and agree with OP in how there is a clear goal for building for the future. 
Most Americans don't want their president to fail because, well, you know, he's our president. Bill Gates has enough money that he doesn't have to do anything, and, instead, he's out there trying to fix the world. Trump plays a lot golf. You do the math.

GET OUT!
ive done some petty things back, i recently went out to eat with the same friend she got mad at me for hanging out with, as well as her ex boyfriend who that girl is friends with and someone else and i posted a video of her ex knowing she would see it lol. Im trying my best to act like i dont give a fuck an going on with my life but sometimes you just have to be petty back.
I guess I could start dropping in heavier places. I usually drop greasy, tomato, or pleasant. Unfortunately the games that I clear out retail or pleasant leaving with 5-7 kills are the ones that are the most difficult for me since there literally are no potions left. I’m not an overly aggressive player, however I enjoy taking fights and when I’m not I try to constantly be running around the map. I think I might need to switch my rotation/drop spots. I think I’ve become overly obsessed with getting dubs over kills and it’s holding me back from being a better player than I am
Exactly 
It matters not so much in that the curriculum is similar, but the alumni network and the prestige of having gone to a certain university. It's what I've seen, at least in the professional world. For academia, if you have a good thing going with a faculty member, then I'd stay at Davis.  You only do your undergrad once (for 99.9% of the people). 
Re: Tomato staking, my Mom rigged up electrical conduit bent into C shapes over her raised beds and tied the plants up. They'd grow so tall you couldn't see the conduit anymore, and it was pretty cheap!
But we saw there are children turned into zombies - the FG outbreak happened at a company picnic. No one has suggested a zombie woman's body could produce a baby - since they barely have heatbeats or blood flow, how would her body keep one alive for 9 months?

 But... you can't be a minority when you are part of the majority, right? Last I checked, normal weight adults were the minority, fewer in number than obese and way fewer in number than overweight. So, how can you be an oppressed minority when you're not the minority?

First of all, I'm not canadian and I'm not a liberal IT poster so leave out your preconcieved ideas about my opinion of islam and so on. I'm a physicist first and a communist second, and if you think yours is a blackpill communism is the blackholepill so I'm surprised that it is not popular among incels.
Oh, both are clearly discriminatory. The question is what discrimination do we deem to be acceptable and what do we not.
Fair point, but I wouldn’t want OP getting into an artist heavily only to later find the video of him brutally abusing his girlfriend. Doesn’t seem much like his taste based on the examples that he posted anyways.
Can we get a time stamp in the video of this??
I was subbed to that channel. Content-jacker turned finger family farm? Probably more revenue.

To me that's the best part of those cars. You can be aggressive and drive it like it's stolen. While still being able to control them.
The last time the US tried to ass blast them it cost the lives of 37,000 americans and 130,000 south koreans.  No one wants to try that again.
Amazing
Baylor and TCU should be distracted with each other, and the G5s in range of us shouldn't be large enough to have a huge impact. We gotta strike quickly on A&amp;M then turn our attention to Houston and the P5s in the state.

&gt; Sora willingly became a Heartless as well, which is why he retained his sense of self as a Heartless too.  Didn't Kairi turn him back from being a Heartless into something like a "walking, talking heart"?  When he became a Heartless, he started losing his sense of self, but then Kairi saved him.

Plus, Israel has nuclear weapons and isn't even a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty?  How is Israel better than Iran?  If Iran isn't allowed to have nukes then Israel isn't allowed to have nukes.  Israel will have to be taken down just like North Korea.  Q says Israel is last.

This is about whether he broke the law.  Some people are saying “but she was successful” and some are saying “it’s her own fault she was not more successful.”  Those might go to how damages are calculated, but fundamentally the lawsuit is about his actions, not hers.

This does sound like narcissism to me, especially considering some of your responses to their drama.   It's possible that they are covert narcissists.   My Nmom is covert, so when I read regular "narcissist checklists" (which mostly describes overt narcissism) she only matches a few descriptors. But when I read about covert (introverted/vulnerable) narcissism she fits the descriptions very closely.   Basically, narcissism can be a spectrum and it can be combined with other personality disorders, making it hard to diagnose.  I would say if you think they're narcissists, they probably are.

Great now when I have to go through security I have to take off my shoes, take off my jacket, take out my laptop, take out my camera, go trough the metal detector, have some guy stick his hand up my arse then when I am finally done with that I'll have to wait another half-hour so some fuck wit can make sure my phone is not a gun. Just so you could carry a gun that looks like a cell phone instead of an actual gun. Thank you.
I'm 100% with you on this. OP's argument is a non-starter. Painting with a broad brush, such as to attribute the actions and views of one person to another, is how we got into this terrible political situation we have in America in the first place. That being said, I think the outrage about the jokes is ridiculous. I'm not a huge fan of Michelle, but the jokes were on point. They invited her there to roast and she fucking roasted.
Thx. You too.
Im sure it would be useful in ultra nightmare since you have to be super careful, but I haven't and will not put myself through that. I know I would end up breaking something

&gt;Arthur: 6.5 -&gt; 7.0 Arthur can actually invest in his Res bulk and dump his Speed for a Green infantry version of Florina/Jagen and achieve impressive results. His performance easily rivals higher tier Axes, and thus he moves up.  So they found out his secret potential heh? I also lately realise his bulk does come in handy sometimes against teams that are focussed on ORKO's.   When there's Bad Luck, there'll be always Good Luck, even for someone like Arthur.

Don’t trust the first shop you go to. If nothing else, at least ask other mechanics for their opinions as well. I had one shop quote me $1500 for an alternator, which is absolutely ridiculous. Second shop I visited? $300. Some mechanics are great, honest, and don’t overcharge, some just take advantage of people. If you can, I’d recommend finding one shop or mechanic to go to every time.

Alex Killorn is a worthless player. 
Alright thanks.
You've actually given me the one piece I'd need to change my mind. If Lego says I'm wrong then I've got no grounds to disagree.  It's the same argument I us for a soft 'g' gif.   So uh, there's that I suppose.  
### **Manny and MAKS: Medical Mayhem**  AKA: Is This Loss?  &amp;nbsp;  # **Initial Notes:**  * All of [Weird Science]’s creations have C Durability * Assumably they also have somewhere between C and A Power * We will actively try to avoid direct conflict with Jade whenever possible as [Mirror Ball] could probably kick our asses pretty quickly * If Jules wants to continuously break down the doors we lock, he’ll keep needing to take on damage to raise [Mirror Ball]’s power  &amp;nbsp;  # MAKS Command Line (Strat will refer to this later)  `10: hack.security.camera;` (Use security cameras to locate Jade’s position.)  `20: hack.security.magneticLock; magneticLock.Lock;` (Lock doors to impede Jade’s progress.)  `30: IF (jade.Escape) THEN (goto 10) ELSE (goto 40);` (If they don’t immediately escape, continue. Otherwise, try to trap them again.)  `40: pager.PageAll;` (Page all residents to Jade’s location.)  `50: IF (jade.Escape = 0) AND (pager.PageAll = 1) THEN (goto 60) ELSE (goto 10);` (If Jade still hasn’t escaped and the residents (Especially Yoko) have been paged, continue. Otherwise, start over.)  `60: powerSystem.Shutdown; backupGenerator.Shutdown;` (Disable all power to hospital after Jade moves through locked doors. This has the effect of deactivating locked doors. Since by this time, doctors have been paged into the hallways, any further attacks against unlocked doors will cause them to fly open, inadvertently attacking doctors/patients and incurring the wrath of the Yoko.)  `70: receiver.Return; (Enter the MEKA-MANNY.);`  //MAKS will constantly be trying to use [Evolution] on Tsao whenever it sees him. If MAKS realizes that Jules left Tsao on the ground floor, MAKS will use [Evolution] on Jules or [MB] instead.  &amp;nbsp;  #Part 1: Through Them Hospital Doors  Manny and MAKS will start off this emergency escapade by having MAKS enter the hospital’s network and start up his Command Line procedures (see above) while [Weird Science] also holds onto MAKS’ receiver for now. Manny will start frantically fusing a bunch of shit found inside an ambulance nearby and will also use part of the liver in his cooler to make it alive. Tsao Xu will probably be trying to make objects fly around at us, so [Weird Science] will stay away from any loose objects while he is still carrying our patient (hereby named Only A Lad). The fusion of assorted ambulance equipment will resemble an exoskeleton. The exoskeleton will be taken out of the ambulance and [Weird Science] will briefly place Only A Lad down, so that it can fuse a stretcher to the back of the exoskeleton. Only A Lad will be strapped to this stretcher. Manny will then cut open a lung from his cooler and spread it out like a large sheet. He will then also fuse some spare blankets from the ambulance into it to make a Lung-Glider and he will fuse this to some part of the exoskeleton.   Manny will also quickly fuse together a makeshift automobile with one of those rolly stretchers from an ambulance, the engine of said ambulance, some onboard computers, any spare wires found in the ambulance, and the intestines from Manny’s cooler. The intestines will act as tentacles and will also have needles and other sharp objects found in the ambulance fused into them to make spiked tentacles. MAKS will then briefly pause his procedures (preferably after he can get most of the employees in the halls as to hinder Jade) and he will take over Stretchmobile’s computer systems and drive it towards the stairs to first floor. He will then direct the tentacles to reach out and stick into the walls while it is in the stairwell. This will force [Mirror Ball] to have to punch these to get them out of the way, and since the tentacles have sharp objects in them, he won’t absorb as much damage as normal. MAKS will resume Command Line procedures after Stretchmobile is put in place.  Manny will then enter his exoskeleton (equipped with Only A Lad on the stretcher, many defibs, and Lung-Glider) and have [Weird Science] strap MAKS’ receiver next to Only A Lad and then the stand will desummon. As a living creation, MEKA-MANNY will be tasked with “holding” Manny inside of it to prevent Tsao from using [HM&amp;RR] to throw Manny out. MEKA-MANNY will then start scaling the outside wall of the hospital up to the first floor. Manny would do this up to the second floor, but he doesn’t want to test his luck too much. [HM&amp;RR] could throw Manny off while we climb, but doing so will hurt Only A Lad on MEKA-MANNY’s back. If Tsao does it anyway, Lung Glider will pop out of MEKA-MANNY to act as a parachute and slow their decent.  &amp;nbsp;  #Part 2: Meanwhile My Attention’s Pulled in Another Direction, Some Receptionist  When MEKA-MANNY enters the first floor, it will probably be by breaking through a window in an occupied room. Manny will have MEKA-MANNY use a defib on someone in the room (preferably a hot nurse chick). Assuming Command Line is going according to plan, Yoko should still be downstairs with Jade Team, so she won’t see us doing what we do. Manny will exit MEKA-MANNY as it suppresses any other people in the room (we don’t need them, but we don’t want them causing us any trouble).   Manny will harvest the stomach, a lung, and some more intestines out of the nurse before fusing her with some nearby bedsheets and used needles. Nurse Biohazard will have these used needles fused to her in a way so that they protrude out from her skin like a hedgehog. The stomach and lung will be fused together so that the gases from the stomach acid will start slowly filling the lung. Manny will also have the new intestines fused with a brain and an eye from Manny’s cooler to use for later. One final fusion he’ll make is by fusing some spare defibs into the door to the room, and will give it to MEKA-MANNY to use as an electrified shield.  Manny will then move MAKS’ receiver from the back of MEKA-MANNY with Only A Lad, to inside the exoskeleton where Manny used to be. MAKS will be strapped in tight and then Manny, MEKA-MANNY, and Nurse Biohazard will start making a beeline to the floor 2 staircase. Before this though, Manny will also fuse miscellaneous materials lying around to armor up the part where MAKS is placed. At this point MAKS will also cease Command Line to take control of MEKA-MANNY.  &amp;nbsp;  #Part 3: Doctor, Doctor, Give Me the News  Ideally, our three heroes will want to get to the floor 2 staircase as fast as possible without any trouble. If we do run into Jade Team however, we’ll try to pass by them without too much of a fight. We’ll do this by simply trying to run past them in the hall if their in our way. Nurse Biohazard will function as spiky meat shield for [Mirror Ball] to punch. If Nurse is not able to take a hit for Manny, for any reason, MEKA-MANNY will be the next line of defense, using its Doorfibrillator shield to block any incoming attacks from either [MB] or [HM&amp;RR]. The electricity from the defibs should cause some damage to [MB] that can’t be absorbed for more power and the damage to Jules won’t be halved as electricity is not a kinetic force. While MAKS is controlling MEKA-MANNY, he will make sure to face towards Jules so that Only A Lad on the exoskeleton’s back will be safer from any of [Mirror Ball]’s attacks.  If Jade hasn’t figured out a way to carry their patient without using [Mirror Ball] by this point, then we probably won’t have to worry about attacks from it. This is very unlikely though, so we aren’t counting on it. What is more likely to happen is that Jules leaves Tsao on the ground floor, as he can still use [HM&amp;RR] on us from there and it would be a pain getting a wheelchair up two flights of stairs. If Tsao has made it up the flight of stairs though, Manny will have MEKA-MANNY throw Brain-Bolo (the brain-eye-intestine fusion) at Tsao’s wheelchair and have the intestine tentacle wrap around his wheels to make it harder for him to move. [HM&amp;RR] will probably throw it out of the way, but Brain-Bolo is alive and will swing its tentacle around to grab onto the wheelchair if the initial throw misses.   As an absolute last resort, if we are not able to get past them, Manny will give the Acid-Lung (stomach-lung fusion) to Nurse Biohazard. The Nurse will then run near Jade Team and puncture the pressurized stomach bomb on her spiky skin. The resulting explosion will spread stomach acid everywhere and hopefully it will stop the two of them. This is incredibly risky as it might also hurt their patient, so we won’t do it unless absolutely necessary.  Obviously however, if Yoko is in the area at all, no fighting will be happening. She creeps us out and we be getting the bad vibes from her. As we don’t directly attack Jade except for dire situations, we should be fine just walking past them. If we’re both walking next to each other at the same pace and can’t take the other out because of Yoko witnessing us, we’ll have MAKS close and lock some fire doors between us and Yoko, and then go back to the above plans for getting past Jade.

City of God  Moonlight  Fight Club  Memento  Children of Men   The Big Short  Logan  Se7en  District 9  Oldboy   Heat  The Matrix  The Departed   I know you prefer 2000s movie, but I highly recommend checking out Goodfellas. If it doesn't peak your interest within the first 3 minutes I don't know what will lol. Also highly recommend Casino and Scarface.
Yes.  NRA is large and has a big legal team.  They bring heavy hitters, have a huge membership to intimidate politicians, and have decades-long plans to expand rights.  However, they tend to ignore stuff they don't see as 'big picture' like bump stocks.  GOA is smaller but fights every infringement they can, period.

Valid point. Though it was a seller selling imported stuff, and most people were giving bad feedback because they don’t wanna understand that importing stuff is a) more expensive and b) takes longer.
Sounds great! I always suggest, especially for newer keto-ers, to not worry about caloric intake. Not suggesting you are, but that seems like a light amount of food! I found first that cracking down on carb intake was key for me, then, balanced my CICO, all while still losing weight. Win win!   Either way, sounds like a great start!  Once you really get the hang of things, take a look into intermittent fasting, you’d be surprised how enjoyable it can be!

A DNS entry is leased, not owned. It can be revoked by the registration authority for any reason compatible with the terms of the registration, ICANN rules or applicable law.  You don't own it and you can't own it. The article says seized, but it's not the right legal term.  There's no need to go through US courts because the US doesn't control the internet.

You can talk about your childhood in your personal statement if you believe that it has influenced your desire to become a doctor. My GPA was sub par, MCAT was average, and I am absolutely not URM, but lemme tell yah, my personal statement was **very** personal. I know the general consensus for personal statement is to not talk about personal struggles outside of medicine and academics, but I took a risk and it definitely paid off for me. PM me if you want some help.
The video isn't bad in itself.  It's just that he only ever seems to make videos complaining about SJWs, and almost never, with a few exceptions from over a year ago, make videos about the much more pressing problem of the alt-right, and their insane conspiracist, racist bullshit. When a youtuber constantly makes videos complaining about SJWs, and nothing else, that drives the alt-right to view Ethan as being on *his* side, and encourages the anti-feminism circlejerk.  And feminism is a *good* thing, but we're already seeing anti-feminists on this subreddit already.  It's starting to feel like if I watch an H3H3 video I'm going to get Armored Skeptic or Steven Crowder videos in my recommended videos.  It's not a good look.  This is why I really like Internet Comment Etiquette.  He's far more equal-opportunity, and not in the fake way South Park is.  If you are a dumbass on the left or on the right, Eric will call you out on it--and the right especially, because the Alex Jones subset of the right is *dangerous as shit*. I just dont' get why Ethan *only* focuses on SJWs.  I know he's discussed why in the past, but it's not convincing.  SJWs are annoying.  I agree.  But there is nothing more toxic on the internet right now than the alt-right.  And I've never seen Ethan seriously tackle this community.
It's treason then

Ah. I was hoping there was some function I was missing out on.
might just have to invest in a new controller then, unfortunately. if you google ‘ps4 analog stick slow turn’ and do some digging, i recall finding someone talking about how to possibly fix it yourself but risk messing up your controller and your warranty. good luck!

If you can deal with that, yes. If you'll just switch to grabbing the nearest women's fashion advertisement, it's pointless.  Anyways, cutting off internet is an ultima ratio, a last resort. Internet's important these days. Consider what else could've been done prior to this incident to prevent a misstep. Here are some examples:  You could set a long, complicated password to your pc, write it down and put it on a room fat from your pc. Acting on impulse will become really hard as sexual energy will dissipate while fetching the password, giving you time and space to reconsider. Essentially *a roadblock*, one of many forms.  You could restrict net access to times you'll spend working. *Protect yourself when you're weakest*, i.e. drained of willpower, tired and bored just before sleeping.  You could go nofap to reduce desire for porn, but I don't have any experience with that and it just *delegates the issue* one step backwards. If you know how to do it and/or wish to attempt it, go ahead. Similar methods apply.  You could *substitute another activity*. "If I feel like X, I will do Y". Pick up a hobby or something you like, and roll with it instead. Taking a shower is a wonderful option, no porn in there but free to masturbate. Playing an instrument works too, do whatever else you like instead of turning on your pc.  You can enter a state you cannot consume porn, effectively *anticipating and preventing* the whole thing. Moving to a public area, calling a friend, cooking, there are many options. The point is, it's no longer 'desire vs willpower' but 'desire vs outside pressure and willpower'. Make it easier for yourself.  
I've been chasing that high since 2015. It was simply glorious.  The Quakecon 2011 Skyrim demo was equally awesome.  That's why I'm not missing this year's E3 for anything (👁 ͜ʖ👁)

You need to use your words with him. If he touches you or taps your shoulder tell him “do not touch me!” Or if he talks to you and you are busy or don’t want to talk tell him “I don’t want to talk right now” if he ignores you repeat yourself with “I said don’t Touch me!” Or “I said I didn’t want to talk”.  You need to stand up for yourself.   Talk your psych professor about switching seats. 
I'm sorry to have been so curt as to make it seem like there's no room for explaining or further discussion - this is a personal fault on my part as I tend to be aggressive when responding to things I would consider wrong view (although I cannot even be certain that you are wrong in the first place!). I would however, like to hear a deeper explanation of what your view is, that we might come to a more complete understanding of this topic

Whether you believe it is basically irrelevant as to whether it can actually be true. American Indians, for example, did not have solely meat-and-fat diets. They had many other options, and most tribes’ diets consisted of more plant-based items than animal-based items, though the stereotype is they ate buffalo and deer sunup to sundown. This is true of most indigenous peoples that eat meat. They generally also eat a lot of roots/nuts/berries/acorns/squashes/leafy plants/etc and were they were so inclined, they could stick to those options. They had other options available and meat was only one. Yet I don’t often hear anyone making the argument, as you are, that there’s no way indigenous people could possibly be respectful of animals and treat them responsibly.  It can be done, and it should be done more if we’re going to continue being an animal-using culture. Not sure why anyone who genuinely cares about animals wouldn’t support that as the lesser of two evils.

Three things I noticed that really bug me/that I need:  - Era/Map selection - More gamemodes that are permanent (ctf with two flags and conquest like modes would be what I desperately need) - Team balancing after the round has ended
That's not really a role, it just happened to be a consequence. The Idea of the Quick role was something with stars, but the star system in general is kinda meh, and the star generation skills/CE s made it even worse for the Quick.  Quick teams need an identity.

Just got my diagnosis after what's apparently a regression, if I did a guess this has only hit me once before, twenty years ago after a friend died.  This time it's what's rolled out of an unexpected surprise re-encounter with the source after a series of unexpected stressors caused me to move back home, so I'm pretty wobbly but somehow hooked up with a good shrink via job rehab (the big obstacle was supposed to just be an SI joint bone spur, it's been quite a ride).  I'm calm at the moment but can't do much without my body freezing up, so as long as I don't move...

I agree that best girl's URs are cute, though like others have mentioned, underwhelming. compared to 2nd and 3rd best girls Yohane and Dia, who have consistently beautiful, popular (?) URs, none of Maru's URs have *really* impressed me. part of it I think is the 3 generic sets she's gotten, but Dia got Halloween and Job URs and those were executed well imo so I'm not sure what else it is.  I like her Halloween UR idolized, but the background in the idolized version is too cluttered for me and detracts from Maru herself. Animal is sadly my least favorite even though it's the set with my 2 best girls and my OTP, because of things often complained about: general dislike for animal sets and poor execution. I like the YohaMaru scissors reference though!  her Teacher UR is my favorite so far. even though it's a school uniform card she looks adorable, it's a set that fits her, and her shorts are fine so it doesn't seem fanservice-y to me. I'm hoping we get that stunning, gorgeous Maru UR soon.
Man I was just trying to give the damn geese some bread at the park, I was only 7 years old I did not need to be swarmed and devoured by 20 geese. They basically rush over and surround you, then proceed to try biting you, your clothes and any skin showing in an attempt to get bread. They are viscous and won't let up until the breads finished. If you want to feed some geese bread, make sure you come in a bloody bullet proof suit and have mechanical arms.

As SomeOriginalName points out below, David Graeber basically argues in his book, that debt based exchange is how most trade happen in most cultures.  He claims coins came around because of soldiers. When organized military was sent far away, they needed to buy provisions in areas where they were strangers. Hence there was a need for something which did not rely on trust like gold coins.  However even if they used debt they might still use previous metals as a way of measuring value. I think Graeber mentions that for hundreds of years after a Frankish king people would write accounts using a silver coin that was never actually minted.  So people traded and wrote down what they owed each other in a coin which didn't physically exist and never had.

I agree there seems to be some weird arbitrary spikes.  There also feels to be some unnaturally hard early bosses like the gal that steals 1 cost minions with her ridiculous 4 mana aoe mind control card that will absolutely beat you the first time you see it.  I think this overall leads to the first dungeon run being much more satisfying to beat.  It felt like your play/drafting actually mattered a lot more.  This monster hunt feels like luck has a lot more to do with it.

While I agree with you that *trickle down economics*, a.k.a. *reaganomics*, a.k.a. *supply side economics*, a.k.a. *voodoonomics*, a.k.a. *wishful thinking*, a.k.a. *magic*, is complete and utter nonsense, I would like to challenge your view on the following:  &gt; I just don't see why that would happen. What incentive is there? By providing an inefficient working wage, they have already demonstrated their selfishness/greed. So you are basically saying "the rich will stop being so greedy if we give them more money."  This is not what voodoonomics is about. It does not assume any benevolence on the part of the rich, but it assumes that the poor are fed by the wastefulness of the rich.  Imagine it like a medieval banquet where the feudal lord enjoys the finest game prepared by the best cooks in his realm. While he's eating the meat from the bones, he throws the bones he's done with on the floor and the dogs will run to scramble for the remaining meat on the bones. Now when the dogs (or the peasants) go hungry, voodoonomics says that instead of giving the dogs more food, we should hold more and more lavish banquets so that the bones that are thrown on the floor contain more meat. Of course the other possibility is that the lord becomes more greedy and gluttonous.  Or in a more modern day example: if we want to fight poverty, instead of giving money to the poor, we should give more money to the rich. That way they can buy more over-the-top, luxurious yachts that they'll visit only a few days every year. That way jobs are created for people that build and sell the yachts, people that perform maintenance on or clean the yachts, construction workers that build the ports and the docks. Etc., etc., etc.  And actually, for very few places around the world, this has actually worked out (e.g. Saint Tropez).

It gave me an identity outside of academics.

#Part 4: Something’s Wrong, She was Lying on the Bed, Crying When I Walked In  With Jade temporarily out of the way, we will sprint to Dr. Feelgood to and we will hand Only A Lad to him. We did it, we saved the day, booyah. Well actually, we forgot one small thing. Now you may be wondering: "They've already completed the objective, what the fuck are these nutjobs doing?" Well dear reader, we at Bikini Bottom have taken it upon ourselves to make a secondary objective: "Capture the enlightened master, Tsao Xu" as a man that old would make an excellent test subject or just give us some sagely advice.  If Tsao had made it up the stairs and is with Jules, then we’ll start to make our back downstairs to run into them again. We’ll rush past them going the opposite direction, with Brain-Bolo (hopefully still attached to Tsao’s wheelchair) reaching out its tentacle arm so that MEKA-MANNY can grab a hold onto it. If MEKA-MANNY is still holding Doorfibrillator at this time, it will throw it at Jules or [Mirror Ball] (or in any direction that won’t harm their patient). MEKA-MANNY will reel in Brain-Bolo and start carrying Tsao in one hand, and Manny in the other. MEKA-MANNY will then rush into a nearby room with a window and jump out back first, still carrying Tsao and Manny. Lung-Glider will then pop out and we will all drift away into the sunset.  If Tsao was left on the bottom floor however, we will sprint straight there, hopefully avoiding Jules on the way back down. Once we reach the bottom floor, Manny will fuse the unused Brain-Bolo into what’s left of Stretchmobile to roughly repair and have it start following them. When they reach Tsao, Stretchmobile will use any non-spiky tentacles to gently grab and move Tsao onto it as they sprint back out of the hospital.  In either of these situations though, one more thing will be done right before they leave. MAKS will use [Evolution] on Jules, either when passing by him or through shooting it from a security camera. MAKS will then whisper to Jules through his stand: “Is this loss?”  &amp;nbsp;  #Manny’s Magic Menu:  * MEKA-MANNY: An exoskeleton made with pretty much anything you would find in an ambulance. Part of a liver from Manny’s cooler is used to make it living. The exoskeleton can open up and hold either Manny or MAKS in it. There are electronics fused into it so MAKS can control it. A stretcher is fused into the back of it so we can carry our patient or other things. The hands of this creation are roughly designed to be decent at scaling a wall. There will also be various eyes around it so that it has pseudo-360 degree vision. * Lung-Glider: A parachute-like fusion made with a cut-open lung from Manny’s cooler and some spare blankets from one of the ambulances * Stretchmobile: An ambulance engine fused with a rolly stretcher, some computer stuff from the ambulance, random wires Manny finds in the ambulance, any sharp objects lying around, and some small intestines from his cooler. Intestines and wires are fused in a way that they act like spiked tentacles. MAKS is able to remote control this fusion as computers are hooked up to the engine and the wires in the tentacles. * Nurse Biohazard: A harvested nurse fused with spare bed sheets and used needles from a hospital room to become a viral hedgehog meatshield. * Doorfibrillator: A door to a hospital room fused with many defibrillators taken from the ambulances where Manny and MAKS start. MEKA-MANNY wields this as an electrified shield. * Acid-Lung: A last resort acid bomb made from the stomach and lung from the above harvested nurse. The idea is that the gases from the stomach acid will rise up into the lung and inflate it, so that when it pops, stomach acid will go flying everywhere. * Brain-Bolo: A simple tentacle creature made with a brain and eye from Manny’s cooler and the intestines from the nurse. Used to stop Tsao’s wheelchair from moving and for possible repair jobs on the Stretchmobile.  #Contingencies:  * During initial phases, Manny will try to cover his face as much as possible so that [HM&amp;RR] doesn’t throw shit in his eyes. * [HM&amp;RR] will most likely be throwing anything Manny tries to use in a fusion all around the place. If this gets to hectic, [Weird Science] will be briefly summoned or any existing creations will fetch the flying stuff. * Most of Manny’s creations will have enough mass that if [HM&amp;RR] wants to push us all over the place, it’ll have to be constantly pushing us, so this probably won’t be very effective. * [Mirror Ball] is able to release a force shockwave, but it seems like that would damage everybody around them so hopefully he won’t do that. * If it seems like [Mirror Ball] will be too much for Manny’s creations, Manny will leave them behind and make a run for the feelin’ good doctor. [Weird Science] will tear the straps off of the stretcher and carry Only A Lad, following Manny to the doctor.

Your argument is failing. If second layer solutions were not widely supported, they would not have support in competing crypto's. Especially Ethereum.
Day game works best if you are very noticeably fit or tall at the mall, especially if your latino, black or Asian. what race of girl are you going for? Are You squaring up, looking her in the eyes, etc?  I find me a skinny latino guy it works best to square up to the girl right away... however honestly I only scored 2-3 hookups all from girls at random coffee shops... I hate walking around to find a good set...I rather approach at nightclubs no walking around and girls are more DTF...  Also big plus to hit on girls your own race so you can see what you are doing wrong.
I can't decide which way to go on this one.   On the one hand, sure its good to go along with everyone else and get in the slow lane. After all, it's the "right thing to do." We should all get in line like responsible well behaved adults.  On the other hand, there is always going to be "someone" who doesn't care about the line, and will choose to go down and cut in. This will happen no matter how "right or correct" it is to get in line and wait. And there is really no penalty for this either. It's not against the law.  My conundrum is this, if someone else is going to do it, why shouldn't I? If fact, in this case, I'm actually getting punished more by doing the right thing.

I love it! Looks great 
For the record, I think this is a phenomenal niche and I have no doubt in my mind that you could make it work and transform it into something profitable.  As far as validation is concerned, I wouldn't limit yourself to just looking at other bloggers \(it's actually ideal if you're the only blogger in a niche that's vastly popular elsewhere.\)  I'm brought back to shows like Brat Camp which play into this idea a lot. I also know there's a lot of books on using the outdoors to cope with these things. I would, honestly, look to Amazon for validation if you can't find blogs in this niche.  When/if you find books in your topic, get a good look at the reviews \- figure out what they say is missing. Look for phrases like "but I wish" or "I would have loved if".  As far as I'm concerned, that's free advice on exactly what people may want you to write about.  Small niche blogs are definitely a little harder to validate \- but even if you don't have the convenience of getting to look up your niche on Pinterest, it's still possible that your topic is popular in ANOTHER medium. That would mean the audience exists, but now you have to draw them in.  Good luck!
hahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

This is either fake, horrible or incel.
There is nothing wrong with living off your nest egg. It isn't like you're hurting anyone or being self destructive or something, infact it sounds like you're doing the opposite by giving yourself permission to be yourself!  Don't let her nastiness make you turn that anger against yourself. You have a right to do this, and it's something you should have had while growing up. I think you're doing an amazing and brave thing. :)

WD40 is **not** a lubricant.  It is a **w**ater **d**isplacement (hence WD).  You're not supposed to use WD40 because you shouldn't be getting water in your mouse to begin with.  Take apart the mouse, find what's causing the squeak, and clean it out.  If you need to lubricate it, use a silicon based 3 in 1 lubricant.  Home Depot sells these for like $3 and they have a million uses.

It is really quite something. My parents have drunk the Kool-Aid (or protein shake) where this mlm is concerned, and they tell me that the product "flushes out toxins" which makes your body release fat, because the fat was only there to protect your body from those nasty toxins. Or something. My mom has struggled with weight loss due to mobility issues since my sister and I were young, she isn't obese or anything, but she's yo-yo'd back and forth between size 14 and 18 multiple times since before signing on with Isagenix and continues to do so.

You can operate as a business just fine without incorporating.  Consider incorporating only after a few years when you have profits and you look at all the factors.   Unless you face the chance of being sued you are probably better working as a Sole Proprietor.    You usually need a business licence issud by the city in which you operate.  The province will need a business name and registration - they all have sites that walk you through the process.  At some level of income you must collect PST and GST and remit. A business needs to keep a set of accounts - the Balance Sheet and Income Statement.  Your tax return will start with those numbers.  There are few perfectly good software packages available in your local London Drugs very cheaply.

This.  Nobody posts about the dozens of times they went to Garage Sales and Thrift Stores and found nothing.  It kind of sets the idea that there's literally stuff everywhere that just requires a single trip to a thrift store to find.  Maybe at one point that was the case but it hasn't been for years.  My last really good find was in Summer 2016.  I haven't seen anything close since locally.  That's why eBay is so popular, you just have to decide what's more important:  Time/Energy or Money.

Jevon Carter will have a 15+ year NBA career as a solid backup guard.  He may play off ball more than people expect on offense, but his primary ball handler defense is going to open eyes.  2-5 all defensive 1st team selections.  Possible DPOY.  Get ready.
In case you haven’t seen my edit, I added some newer research I found to my previous comment. The study itself is solid, showing a correlation between prior vaporizer use and future initiation (within 6 months) of the use of a tobacco product (not necessarily becoming a smoker, but at least trying cigarettes or similar once). They politicized it a bit when they took it to the media, but the methodology is sound and offers some groundwork for better funded, more specific research.

All I am saying is good luck trying to get the Chinese sellers like Taobao, Aliexpress and DHGATE to collect GST hahahaha these sellers at your request will declare items as gifts or worth $2 and package it up in anything that resembles the original box for you. I can't imagine customs, courier companies and NZPost opening every item they suspect is not declared at proper price and inspecting each and every single thousand parcels that come into NZ to collect GST for the NZ government the resourcing of this from these companies alone would make it uneconomical .. good luck NZ Govt!

I'd say OP's meme is making them out to be the same thing when they absolutely aren't (also, OP's a capitalist, so make of that what you will) but I wouldn't say there's zero equivalence.

Well, kind of on both. On his mom's side there are four named brothers and unnamed sisters. Catholics claim the Greek is being metaphorical and these aren't actually brothers but coudins or some other relation because they believe Mary was a perpetual virgin (the actual textual evidence for that js pretty weak, but there we are.)  In a broader sense, all Christians are adopted children of God, which makes us adopted brothers on God's side.

It's not possible for any group to not have that problem subset. Human nature is very diverse, and the only thing that brings a group of people together is that interest or thing they share in common; beyond that, you are inevitably going to see every trait under the sun. No group made of human beings is ever going to be exempt from having a few problem members. One of the real hallmarks of true adulthood is recognizing this and not judging the entirety of a movement by those "bad apple" members.

I'm a former Edgy Teenage Atheist who returned to the liberal Lutheranism I was raised with and I get the same shit, especially when I mention that I'm an ex-atheist. It's infuriating. It's sad how these folks think they are so "highly rational" and yet get so easily enraged when they are politely corrected for a claim that just ain't true. Or I'll try to explain how deductive reason and empirical fact is not the be-all and end-all of truth and they'll start rambling on about Russell's Teapot or other talking points showing that they are projecting their own imaginary straw-theist into my mouth and have no capacity to comprehend truth that is not empirical or deductive.
Completely, this is pretty much ruining the show at this point. It's really depressing and upsetting. I can't believe MTV was able to insure him after what he did to Sam \(hard to get specific, so many instances, but the one where he trashed her room and was physically fighting her with a mattress between them in the hallway\). He should have been reported and prosecuted for domestic abuse when that happened. MTV and their producers need to be held culpable at some point.

All things are possible with our lord and Savior Hans Hermann Hoppe.  &gt; "There can be no tolerance toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They will have to be physically separated and expelled from society. Likewise, in a covenant founded for the purpose of protecting family and kin, there can be no tolerance toward those habitually promoting lifestyles incompatible with this goal. They–the advocates of alternative, non-family and kin-centred lifestyles such as, for instance, individual hedonism, parasitism, nature-environment worship, homosexuality, or communism–will have to be physically removed from society, too, if one is to maintain a libertarian order."

Rightmove have the estate agents with multiple branches and the more expensive properties, and Zoopla have the estate agents with local presence and cheaper properties. There is some crossover of course. Onthemarket is another decent app for UK property search, but less well known. The main differences I found are in how their pages display on screen, and how their filters allow you to fine tune your search parameters.

*Jane Eyre* is wonderful. There's so many scenes were the feelings and tone invoked continue to follow me to this day.  It's a book that alternately fills you to the brim and leaves you empty.   There's pieces of us in every character, and, at points, watching Jane grow is like watching yourself grow. The devastation and joy. The lows and highs. They mimic real life in a fantastic way. 
If we win without Baylen, we win the series. Simple as that. 
Possible but it was entertaining enough that I don't care. 
I seriously doubt Whedon had a lot of meaningful input into either the Coloring process or the mustache removal in JL. Not only because the director probably wouldn't have much input there, but because those strike me as both two very studio-inspired aesthetic choices. JL is by far the ugliest film Joss has directed.
I don't mind alts of legendaries since they serve as upgrades in a sense to their previous characters, considering that they tend to be based on their promoted classes, and also, since they aren't taking a spot for a new character, I'm not as angry when that spot could've been given to someone not in the game yet.  Still, I would've preferred a legendary of Alm (who doesn't even have an alt yet surprisingly...) or Takumi, rather than a 5th Lyn.

Ahh ok, you won't find many LMC on this subreddit unfortunately. My threads are People (CS thread) and Interactive Design &amp; Experimental Media (LMC thread). I will say that even as an LMC major you'll probably end up doing some coding. Other than that, I really like our LMC options because most classes are project-based, so we can create things and actually put theories into practice. The actual class focus varies heavily with the teacher, but you'll still gain a wide skillset as long as you stretch yourself to make something new and learn different technologies every time. You get what you put in with LMC at Tech. My favorite classes are actually for CM students (LMC 2700 and CS 2261), but I did love 2720 which teaches you foundation principles for design, and anything cross-listed with Industrial Design is fun (hands-on). I also recommend taking Special Topics courses. They're usually announced during registration, and they typically explore something unique (this semester I took an LMC one for Augmented and Virtual Reality). There's also a lot happening independently of classes - clubs like User Experience design, projects run by professors during the semester/summer, and useful labs like DILAC (specializes in VR) and the Invention Studio where you can pursue your personal projects and sharpen skills. Definitely read what's posted on the walls and pay attention to what people are doing, look for opportunities to do cool stuff. Personally I came trying to find where the technical and creative meet, so the theory part of many of my classes has been just as useful as the projects. Even though I'm prettyyyy stressed at times, I've really enjoyed learning what avenues are being explored and seeing all the areas I could pursue. Basically I hope to see where I most want to apply myself. In high school I had no idea what I wanted to be, so applying myself here has helped me figure that out a bit. Last couple things, if you like writing at all (you don't need experience or "talent"), take Poetry and Poetics or Creative Writing. Best experience in college. Also, the High Museum has a design in the digital age exhibit right now, and I consider it a CM/LMC dream come true, so check it out if you can. I think it ends some time this month. If you have any more questions, let me know! Sorry if this didn't answer your questions &gt;&lt;

Placing the blame on the other. They can't blame 'Chad' because they secretly want to \*be\* Chad, so they have to blame the girl, and it's a culture based around confirming to one another that it is women, not themselves, who are to blame for their own misery. I'm not an Incel but as a younger teen I had the misfortune of meeting a \(now that I think about it, inappropriately older\) guy who was one and I really tried to help him. He was only interested in external validation that it was everyone else to blame.

Then argue your point 
Yep.  Nobody in Congress ever says a word when money for the Military or a War is needed.  This is because they understand that they control the creation of money.  They only talk about costs when it comes to providing funds for things that would help the poor.  They create the false choice of having to increase taxes on the middle class in order to support the poor in order to generate hatred for the poor.

You must have misread my post. I said I'm in the 2018-2019 season. I have $8.555M in cap space for **next** season. All the numbers I posted are for the 2019-2020 season, not the current season. Meaning, I have enough to sign that player who wants $5.4M according to my cap space for the next season, which you can see in the 'All Contracts' menu by hovering over the next season's column, but it's saying I only have $3.705M in extension dollars.

There aren't a lot of them simply because liberal humor for the most part takes a recognition/embrace of empathy, while conservative humor is an denial/outright rejection of that empathy.  It's why the 1/2 Hour News Hour failed because they don't realize that a majority of people don't like an asshole.

I would say yes.  10,000 years ago, the only human species left on Earth was our own, meaning that the baby in question would be an Anatomically modern human, so they would be physically and mentally our equal.  Evidence shows that humans from all around the world had long been producing artwork depicting abstract ideas, such as the Lion-man, a mix between a lion and a man: Sites such as Europe's Chauvet Cave and Australia's Bradshaw rock paintings bear ages greater than 10,000 years, and consistently depict artwork whose production would require some sort of spiritual, imaginative or abstract thinking: So I'd wager than this person (lets assume he's male and call him Bob, to avoid too many "him/hers" and "Baby Xs") would be able to do abstract mathematics and get a PHD in Biology.  Being the same species as us, Bob would have a growth rate not terribly different from our own. Having similar mental capabilities here, I'm sure he'd be able to communicate and socialize with other humans and build relationships, and have healthy offspring.  I should think that Bob wouldn't look too physically different from his/her contemporaries, nor would his peers think of Bob as an outsider, provided they didn't know that he was an anachronistic Pleistocene baby  [Source ](https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-to-take-a-newborn-baby-from-prehistoric-times-say-10-000-years-ago-and-raised-him-her-in-modern-times-would-this-child-grow-up-to-be-like-us-Could-he-she-go-to-school-do-a-PhD-in-Genetics-or-any-other-thing-that-we-can-do-now)

I don't think this is bashing men. Living how you want to live means you set your own standards.

I would recommend this [Lenovo Yoga 720] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072M22XK8/?tag=bkadamos_alltest-20) because it comes with everything you need, 7th generation, i7 quad core CPU which is one of the best in the market and great for your usage, 16GB of ram for smooth multitasking, good SSD storage of 512GB for faster boot up and loading, 15.6 inch 4K UHD IPS touch screen which is a must have for this price range, high build quality, backlit keyboard, supports pen, thunderbolt port, and it’s within your budget.  I thought I would give you a little more in-depth review, so here it goes:   * It’s equipped with Intel Core i7-7700HQ which is commonly used in gaming laptops, most convertibles use low powered dual core processors. The processor of capable of delivering enough power for most of work’s intensive tasks and gaming.   * Full HD (IPS) 15.6 4K Touchscreen, which is very rare for this budget range and great for watching movies/videos. With color range of 90 % sRGB and 59% Adobe RGB it’s one of the best for this price and it’s suitable for average/mid content creators. Viewing angles are great with the IPS panel but with its glossy finish it’s not the best choice for outside usage.   * NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 2 G is one of the most common GPUs for mid prices gaming laptops. It will run most Games with variant settings depending on the game requirements with good FPS * Heat management isn’t the best as the device heats up under load and CPU throttles to maintain reasonable temperatures, but it doesn’t reach the point of hurting the internal components          * Good upgrades available, can go to 32 GB of ram, and even change the SSD. It’s relatively easily upgradable which isn’t the case for most convertibles.   * It’s good on connectivity with 2 X USB 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 3.           * Battery life is from 7 to 8 hours of normal non-gaming usage. * Minimal bloat-ware, speakers have excellent quality but not so loud, Keyboard is excellent as you would expect from Lenovo keyboards, Trackpad aren’t much different with windows precision driver, It has fingerprint scanner which is fast and accurate, The body is sturdy and feels premium as it’s all aluminum.

It's so useful. As a college student what takes the most time is opening a Wikipedia article of whatever, and having to constantly flick back and forth between that and your article you are writing. Because you spend quite a lot of time losing your place and having to read through again to find it.   So what you do is copy and paste a paragraph and use overtype to reword it as you go along so it isn't plagiarised.   Admittedly you could just copy and paste a paragraph on top and paraphrase on the bottom, but with overtype you don't lose your place while reading thus can type faster.

Except that "all natural" is, as stated, an arbitrary statement in and of itself. There's no way to define what "all natural" is, which is why you see such statements both on heavily processed foods as well as those that have only undergone minimal processing.  The "kernel" of what's being said is "Hey, you! Buy this food because 'all natural' means healthier!"

I agree. I ran through this game blind, beating the first 4 character's past without looking it up. But there were times I didn't know what to do (getting the bullet parts and what to do with the old TV) and I went to the wiki to figure out what to do. Though I saw the list of floors of the Gungeon.

So he flew higher ^and ^higher ...until the sun melted his wings...and he fell into the sea. But the United States Army is NOT an irresponsible father. So they gave us wings of white hot, cold-rolled, Pennsylvania steel, *gar-oon-teed*...not to melt" - Preston Packard
I would disagree with it being impossible for others to not be vegan based on that idea. It just takes the right motivation. Earthlings would be one of those things that would probably turn someone over to veganism. Or possibly forks over knives if they are into health. Cowspiracy if they are environmentally minded. Vegucated for pretty much anyone too. There are many motivators out there. It’s all about finding the right one for the right person.

I've lived here my whole life and in the Springs you have 3 options. Comcast, Centurylink, and Peak internet. Comcast goes out alot esp in the winter but the service isn't bad. Centurylink deployed fiber to the home to most of the city the last two years even the older neighborhoods have it. Peak uses 4G LTE and mounts an antenna on top of your residence for service. I've had service with all and if you are doing this for a home based business I would recommend either Comcast or Centurylink but only Centurylink if they have fiber if its DSL then just go with Comcast.

The coordinated fud today by whales to lower the price of EOS so they can rebuy lower has been breathtaking.  It astounds me how good they are getting at manipulation.  Multiple front page posts, fake vulnerabilities, tons of paid fud comments on reddit and biz, these people are good at what they do.  All coordinated with EOS hitting the top on RSI yesterday (from the wash trading and shilling and fomo) and them selling.  And now it is going back up.  If you aren’t along for the ride they are going to create next month, you aren’t paying attention.
Once deep fake videos are less obviously fake, I’m worried about exactly this. It has the ability to completely destabilize any trust people still have in media, journalism and even our public institutions.  We don’t have a defense against this currently and with the amount of anti-intellectualism already present in the US, with how many people fall for Onion articles or all the fake FB ‘news stories’ during the 2016 election, I’m worried the technology could be the final nail in the coffin for truth-based discourse.
And people can disagree with me all they want, but what I find concerning is the fact that it smacks of the authoritarian policies of the_D, complete with name-calling and instant banning. I’ve seen a couple of posts in “left” subs that are EXTREMELY anti-Democrat, making me think there is a real propaganda campaign to cannibalize the left.   I’ve never had an interaction even close to this previously in this sub. 
Nope essentially do the same process as you would for a traditional sauerkraut. I use approximate 1 tbsp of salt for 1 and change pounds of vegetables.

Thanks :)
&gt;It has a soft cap before your speeds are restricted.  Can we please stop pretending that "soft caps" aren't caps?  &gt;Besides, pretty much the only thing that charges to your data on TMobile is internet browsing. Most of the popular streaming apps don't count towards your data usage.  That's another complaint I have, popular streaming services get free data but I have to pay for every byte I move through my home VPN?
Curry was the catalyst for that game, but to say he carried the load offensively is a hyperbole. Klay dropped 32 points on 61 TS% in that game too.
I read that whole thing. I'm trying to imagine a good reason that you would stay married to your wife. All I can come up with is that she's now working, about to get a promotion, and that will reduce your alimony if you lock in her new income numbers.  If you're going to stick around a few more years anyway, get her working now. No kids who spend all day at school need a SAHM, especially one who sleeps more than an egyptian mummy.  Also, you said a dumb thing in there about the decision to SAHM, which was that if she was working she would just been handing the money over to day care / preschool. First, that kind of care gets cheaper as the kid gets older. Second, when your wife stops working, it gets harder and harder to re-enter a career at a place where you left off. My wife basically took three years of part-time work / shit jobs to work back to the money and prestige she had when she quit working. She was also a shitty SAHM. I hope your wife at least cooks and cleans. The first crappy jobs my wife had, yeah, we were breaking even or the money was even going backwards. It was totally worth it to have current industry contacts and for her to network her way into a better job. It never would have happened for her to have gone straight from SAHM to the unsolicited job offer she received where she now makes almost as much as me.  Step one, any job she can get. Step two, network into better job. Repeat as needed.  Congratulations on the DL11. One of the few things I see you did right when faced with that woman. My MIL isn't as big of a cunt as yours, but my MIL was the common denominator in three divorces. My wife made noises about moving MIL into our place, and I told her if MIL moves in, she'll be part of a fourth divorce. You can be 'busy' every time you're asked to spend time with her, and you can also tell her off to her face.

We also shouldn't let anyone build a house next to ours in case they burn that down too, right?  What makes RVs different? I doubt the rate of motionless RVs burning down is that significantly higher than permanent structures.
I have an "awkward shuffle" when I'm feeling anxious. I pretty much pick my feet up and put them back down without moving
This is absolutely correct. It's a the basic issue pretty much any large scale retailer will experience. More employees (even part time / minimum wage) are very expensive to hire and train. There's a very fine line between cost/reward for having "a few more employees" in literally thousands of stores for these big box retailers.
That’s besides the point. Stop stating factual things. The transpiracy is taking over the world.  *evil laugh*   /s
This symbol is sometimes referred to as the “Cross of questioning,”.  Created by artist Bill Gawlick for the band’s first album, the symbol is patterned after the astrological symbol of Saturn/Cronus, in the shape of a sickle. (it is the image of the God of time with his sickle that gives us the modern concept of the Grim reaper) It is not a question mark, an upside down cross, or a Satanic symbol, although for a brief time in the eighties, the symbol became popular as a “secret satanic symbol” among evangelical anti-rock crusaders. Contrary to Urban Legend and tract writers, there is no corresponding “anti-Christian” symbol.
Shouldn't you be planning your E3 cuck session?
That's rough, bro. I'm sorry to hear it.  I am almost the only friend of my girlfriend, and i feel so bad for her, because i know she would do almost anything to bargain her way out of it.  Its funny how some people want a lap dog, but the fact that she'll put up with me not loving her makes me want out even more

I'm probably one of the last people to take advice from, but you may do what you want with this suggestion. Set up a "date," but don't do dinner (not yet at least), go bowling, mini-golfing or something else that's fun. After that, get a meal with her, it won't really matter how fancy the food is, as long as it's good. Throughout all of this, tell her how you feel, and be honest with her. I hope this can help you, I'm going through a very similar event myself and I honestly don't know what I'm doing. From what I do know, the most important thing is to not forget your wallet.
They will be brought back with the infinity stones or through another manner in Avengers 4. Most likely some of the original Avengers will die in the process of bringing them back.

I think this manga has some interesting lessons. However, I wasn't really a fan of the initial "protagonist is wrong, main heroine is right" approach. It seems like it's too black and white.
Right on. The kids might be thinking what's this white gooey stuff? Children are too innocent and should not be around sexual material. However according to this couple, that semen is the good stuff. Sigh....

&gt; It seems they are ignoring the possibility of men being cuckolded in such circumstances.  What does this bit mean though, Ding?  I know that "cuck" has taken on new life as a slur popular in conservative/traditionalist/PUA circles, but it's also a humiliation fetish and prior even to that refers to little more than the condition of one's wife cheating on them under any circumstances at all.   So which of the three meanings do you refer to, what possibility?
No, this is Patrick.

Everything except for SKSE and mods that require it work with the new patch. I had 140 mods installed, patched and everything worked just fine, not a single issue. All the things you mentioned would be 100% possible with the beta build.  There are plenty of posts about all the cool graphics mods you can do, but I could mention some of my favourites:  'Obsidian weathers' works really well and looks great as a weather mod imo.  'Skyrim is windy' and 'Blowing in the wind' really adds to immersion  'torches cast shadows' is fantastic  'Darker nights' because really dark nights are awesome, espeically in VR  [dungeon darkness](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7535) is also great for the same reasons.  Also - there are some sound mods which are vital imo, specifically [3D audio](https://github.com/kosumosu/x3daudio1_7_hrtf/releases) (make sure you grab the skyrimVR patch), and then layering lucidity (for improved base vanilla audio), audio overhaul (overhauls vanilla audio further, adding location-based reverb and effects) and finally immersive sounds compendium for expanding the soundscape.  **QOL/immersion/roleplaying:** Immersive vr quickslot tool is a must, I found the [latest beta build](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8fv1m5/immersive_vr_quickslots_020_pre2_testers_release/) to work without issues.  SkyTEST realistic animals and predators is insane for immersion imo, absolutely necessary.  Bandolier bags and pouches has made inventory management a lot more manageable for me while also adding to immersion and feeling balanced, very much recommended.  Skyrim unbound - seems to work better than live another life, allows you to skip the intro and start in various places around the world with customizable starting gear and spells etc. Let's you get around every character having the same initial story and you can get around ever doing any part of the main quest (though you can start it any time you want after you have unlocked your first shout).  'Even better quest objectives' is a great way to rely less on quest markers.  'Footprints' adds a really cool missing detail  'Cloaks of skyrim' is awesome as well  OBIS - organized bandits in skyrim, and 'immersive patrols' adds some more stuff to encounter along the roads.  'Royal armory' and 'zim's immersive artifacts' make the cool treasure actually be cool.  'Hold border banners' is another great detail mod  'Immersive citizens', since the previous patch I've had no issues with it, adds some cool immersive behaviours.  And then there's the whole [immersive navigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/8cbldz/immersive_navigation_never_use_that_world_map/) 'package' if you like that sort of thing.  **Mage stuff:**  Of course you really should grab apocalypse, and I'd argue ordinator as well (with the VR perk fix). Adds so many cool builds, effects and spells for magic users. (And I'm using andromeda as well for even more potential builds). These also add effects like ocato's recital that make managing your buffs and triggering effects a lot easier and more fun.  The quickslot tool helps with managing all your spells but you could try some voice control as well, through Way of the voice or Dragonborn speaks naturally.   I'm also using 'better wards' to make them a little stronger and stagger agaisnt melee attacks, because I like using wards and it makes them less useless.  **Difficulty/combat**  I'm using smilodon, mortal enemies and realistic melee range to make enemies more aggresive, easier to actually dodge and add some challenge. Smilodon also has an option to increase both your and your enemies damage output a great deal to create a difficult but non-bulletspongy combat with quick brutal fights (Personally though I feel like things die pretty quickly anyway so I don't use it).  I also use 'no BS AI projectile dodge', because it removes a major annoyance from longer range combat.
It's one of those scenarios where you'd -  1. Say "o-oh ok-okay" and then find a seat elsewhere or stand  2. Post a thread/comment on reddit/Facebook/social media outlining your frustration at the situation  3. Spend the rest of the train ride imagining and playing out scenarios in your head where you could've/should've said something else to bring justice and then live off that feeling until you get off at your stop

Choosing the Villain would probably make Garen a little too strong. Perhaps they could introduce a timer after which the passive becomes available to us and we can choose who gets marked to prevent us from instantly choosing our lane opponent. Maybe after 15 minutes or something like that. Perhapa they could opt to change what Villain does, maybe limit the true damage to our ult only and give us a chance to decide along with a reward for successfully executing the villain. There is alot of room to give Garen more power without making him insane!

Definitely. It is common for mathematicians to discover some neat math tool and then for other disciplines to start using it in unexpected ways.   Or it could be that someone develops a new mathematical system specifically for a certain problem. Newton pretty much “invented” calculus to help him describe his physics. 
It is definitely touching audio capture, by the registry entry name. Thats what made me think voice chat. But i suppose it could be anything audio related.   Looks like google says the registry entry catalogs your audio devices. So for some reason, PUBG is continually querying your default audio device. With Fortnite doing the same Im willing to bet its a quirk of Unreal Engine.

My man, black men worked to get rid of him crow, alongside black women. Disabled people (some of whom are men) have worked to get rights for themselves. Gay men (100% men) worked to get gay rights (yes lesbians are real and they worked too but that defeats the point) I don’t really know why I’m on this subreddit. Nobody cares what I have to say because I’m not gonna feed into this echo chamber. I’d just like to say my man, that yeah toxic masculinity is a thing, and yeah it really sucks so much dick. I personnally have to work on actually feeling my emotions, and not just lashing out in rage rather than getting at what’s underneath, because I’ve been conditioned to think that “men don’t cry” and “you’ve always got to be strong”. I’m glad that you’re noticing that the patriarchy sucks for everyone, in different ways. You may not believe that’s what you’re doing, but you are. My question is, are those difficulties that you are “ugly” or socially inept. Imma tell you right now my man, I have some sever anxiety, and I rup at my face in order to “purge the poison” under my skin by picking at acne and tearing it apart. It leaves scabs and blood all over my face, that is not super attractive. You are allowed to complain about your problems, he’ll i do it all the time, but you aren’t allowed to complain about them instead of trying to fix them.

But he’s confident in the plan at the end.   There’s was one single outcome where they’d win. If that was dependent on other people’s actions it would be impossible to know that they’d do it, so there wouldn’t be any paths to victory except random luck.

First advice I would say is check out your local donation stores. There is a slight chance you might be able to find exactly what you are looking for there.  If you have no luck there, I would suggest looking up sewing techniques on youtube and making it all from scratch.

Oh and word of advice: good enough is good enough. You don't have to aim for 100% accuracy.

&gt; Barriers to entry nullify comparative advantage. If someone's maximum productivity is less than minimum wage, they are unemployable. If the cost of logistics is greater than the difference in advantages, trade is at a loss. Some people cannot be retrained.  Barriers to entry do not nullify comparative advantage.  They might make it an unpersuasive argument to the individual in your hypothetical but that doesn't make it nullified given all the other considerations or the worse argument when it comes to what policies to pursue. &gt;For an uneducated, 45-year-old factory worker in Missouri, or an unfortunate urban youth with an IQ of 80, the factory closing down could be the end of all possible opportunities for them.  That's simply false, even in a hypothetical in which we can tweak all variables without constraint.  People are not obligated to remain where they are, sure that factory might be the most immediate opportunity but relocating to find better economic opportunities is a story as old as written history.  Minimum wage is [relatively](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE) low in the US compared to the [rest](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RMW) of the OECD countries, there will be employment at that level available in any area with economic prospects.  That economic opportunity is always present in every corner of a country has always been false.  This suggestion that public policy can create specific types of viable economic enterprise in any area regardless of the state of the variables that largely dictate economic success or opportunity is utterly hollow and has been the siren song of lying politicians and false populism for a very long time. &gt;Sure, things get cheaper, the economy improves, but a small section of the population's lives are consigned to welfare or disability.  That it doesn't have a comparative advantage doesn't mean it isn't viable, just that it's less efficient generally.  It doesn't mean every factory should close, but some probably will and that's not the hill anyone should be dying on.

That's really tough. I love Donaldson as a player and the way he plays in this game, however, he's had a down year and may be downgraded soon. If he sells for over 70-80K, I think I'd have to sell him.  Just looked at the Blue Jays collection and it's a gold Fred McGriff, that's really lame. So many awesome players they coulda had for that and they give us a weak Fred McGriff?
