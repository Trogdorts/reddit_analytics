Welcome back to r\/RandomActsOfBlowJob!  As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution.

You can call it moving the goalposts I see it as understanding the argument you are making doesn‚Äôt hold water and explaining why. Stadia can get all the indies it wants but none of them will ever bring as many players and resources as Warzone and that to me should be the primary focus of Google-to cut a deal with Activision.
iNsPiRaTIoN!  I think you should ask your buddy some pointed questions about how he can consider himself a good father if he supports an organization that marginalizes his son...in front of his son.  If he thinks you value his friendship more as a bishop than a father, then you need to find a new buddy.

You did the right thing. Especially leaving the gun out of the situation. You could be living with a lifetime of guilt if you had shot or killed him.   The problem with the mental health in this county is that they‚Äôre understaffed and there‚Äôs only so much they can do to help. If someone decides to not be med compliant, they just have to try to check on them. The severely mentally ill need a safe place to live so we can care for them.

"Oh, Tyler got loose! Tyler got loose!"
I need to stop wandering outside this thread, I get too triggered.
Is this true?
I'm sorry, but I have to chuckle at the idea that you can't do criticism without some sort of special credential.  The problem doesn't have much to do with the qualifications of the people writing as the structures and incentives.  Game publications live and die off of hype and exclusive interviews and previews.  Giving big-budget, highly-anticipated games negative or unenthusiastic reviews 1) makes fans angry because you're killing the hype (look how apoplectic people went over a 7/10 score for RDR2, for instance) 2) sours your relationship with game publishers whose cooperation you need for exclusive content.  And simply put, there just isn't that big an audience for a general-interest publication that's going to review games months late and be a wet blanket about them.  Gamers want to be hyped up and they want to play the big games at the same time everyone else is playing and talking about them.  I also disagree with your idea that reviews shouldn't be subjective.  What's the point then?  Of course a review should fairly describe the game mechanics and so on, but it's an opinion piece.  If it's well done you should be able to tell whether you'd like it, even if your conclusion is different from the reviewer's.  But trying to turn it into an encyclopedia entry is silly.
On a lighter note. Well worth following Rosslare Harbour on Twitter. There's occasional subtle trolling.   https://twitter.com/RosslareHbr?s=09

Applying the wrong fertiliser to the golfing greens can have disastrous results for sure.
I think you need to deal with this through one or more of the following:  1. Reporting this 'blacklisting' to Fair Work Australia: [https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/our-role/enforcing-the-legislation/workplace-investigations](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/about-us/our-role/enforcing-the-legislation/workplace-investigations) 2. Get people who are being targeted to join a union and seek help from the union about what to do (this is literally the point of trade unions).  Looks like that might be the Hospitality Workers Union: [https://www.unitedworkers.org.au/hospitality-workers-union/](https://www.unitedworkers.org.au/hospitality-workers-union/) although you should be aware that often more than one union will cover the same sector. 3. Talk to a lawyer about the defamation angle.  You would be surprised how easy it is to succeed in a defamation claim.  Plenty of lawyers would be happy to speak to you about your options.  Make sure you screenshot everything you can as potential evidence. 4. To the extent there are issues like family members details being posted on line, report it to the police ASAP and don't allow them to brush you off. 5. Raise this with politicians at the Council, State Government and Federal Government levels.  Don't go for the 'community' politicians, try to find people with a track record of standing up for members of the public in relation to these issues.  I'd suggest starting with phoning the office of your local members at the State and Federal level and asking for a meeting.  At the moment that Steve Georganas at the Federal level ([https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators\_and\_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=DZY](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=DZY)) and Rachel Sanderson at the State level: [https://www.rachelsanderson.com.au/](https://www.rachelsanderson.com.au/)

Also. Fucking hell - what a belting... unreal.
I exclusively sleep on my side and broke my arm in July. I rejected a sick note for 2 weeks off work, since it didn't hurt much during the day and I knew I'd just be bored at home. But after 3 nights of failing to sleep on my back for more than what felt like 20 mins per night (when I finally dozed off I would try to flip over in my sleep and be jolted awake by agony in my arm), I had to call in sick anyway just because I was tired and emotional to the point it affected my performance. Luckily I could manage to sleep on one side with a pillow after a few more days of healing and swelling going down.  That would be my permanent reality if I was beachball tits over here!

Long story short: it does nothing to explain or take accountability for her actions.  I believe she was referencing internalized racism. She was basically embracing her proximity to whiteness (which she had through being biracial) because she associated Blackness with bad things. Again, it‚Äôs irrelevant to the issue at hand, and imo just another way she tried to play the victim instead of actually apologizing for the harm she caused.

No Hong Kong as in ruled by a local party which get's power over 20 million people and any who wants to flees to the West.   Given Iran still has not dealt with the Shah's apparatus when they took over in 1979 excuse me for doubtful over their efforts.  Not magically my point is that rather than a strait up annexation attempt one would see local pro unification given their support among the people who really matter in Taiwan the army. You don't really need major support long term to hold power in Taiwan, just enough till the PLA can land.  Once it's war or war they might want to sell Taiwan for a protected status in a special administrative region.   More the direction of where the economy is going to show the elites of the nation ties to China.   https://www.ft.com/content/9bdbbcc4-3a7d-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0  Fair point it's hard to find sources pointing to the possibility, more I'm always kind surprised more people don't discuss a hybrid reunification attempt than only military/political ones  that come up in threads like these.

One of the morons who did this wasn't even a deputy but a cadet. He only got caught because he thought showing pictures of the victims' corpses to a bartender he was hitting on would impress her. She ended up reporting him.  The fact that a cadet had possession of these pictures and not a single deputy had an issue with that should tell you about the kind of cops we have.  People rightfully should be losing respect for law enforcement more and more every day.

iTerm. Minimal theme with transparency like at 80%.
This collection of deleted scenes (4k [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27369178/chapters/67566659)|[FFN](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13667145/7/Beastars-A-New-Generation)) from Beastars: A New Generation is probably the best bet for the fandom blind. It's screenplay format (kinda). Skim/skip the first scene of closing credits montage since it ~~does~~ doesn‚Äôt make much sense on its own. To the totally uninitiated, I describe Bestars as a rather dark version of Zootopia.   If you are familiar with Beastars, start at the very beginning with Beastars Season 1.5 ([AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27130594/chapters/66252022)|[FFN](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13644222/1/Beastars-Season-One-Point-Five)) The first two episodes (9k each) work fairly well as stand alone pieces. (if you are inspired to go beyond that, the two stories make a grand arc of 87k.)

This one?  The one where he says he forcefully opposed the Uygher camps and says there will be repercussions for that policy? &gt;COOPER: What about the Uyghurs? What about human rights abuses in China?  &gt;BIDEN: The Uyghurs.  &gt;We must speak up for human rights. It's who we are. We can't -- my comment to him was -- and I know him well, and he knows me well. We're -- a two-hour conversation.  &gt;COOPER: You talked about this to him?  &gt;BIDEN: I talked about this too.  &gt;And that's not so much refugee, but I talked about it. I said, look -- Chinese leaders, if you know anything about Chinese history, it has always been the time China when has been victimized by the outer world is when they haven't been unified at home.  &gt;So, the central -- to vastly overstate it, the central principle of Xi Jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled China. And he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. I point out to him, no American president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the United States. And so the idea I'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in Hong Kong, what he's doing with the Uyghurs in western mountains of China, and Taiwan, trying to end the One-China policy by making it forceful, I said -- by the way, he said he gets it.  &gt;Culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow. But my point was that, when I came back from meeting with him and traveling 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president and he was the vice president -- and that's how I got to know him so well, at the request of President Hu -- not a joke -- his predecessor, President Hu, and President Obama wanted us to get to know one another, because he was going to the president.  &gt;And I came back and said, they're going to end their one-child policy, because they're so xenophobic, they won't let anybody else in. And more people are retired than working. How can they sustain economic growth when more people are retired?  &gt;COOPER: When you talk to him, though, about human rights abuses, is that just -- is that as far as it goes in terms of the U.S.? Or is there any actual repercussions for China?  &gt;BIDEN: Well, there will be repercussions for China. And he knows that.  &gt;What I'm doing is making clear that we, in fact, are going to continue to reassert our role as spokespersons for human rights at the U.N. and other agencies that have an impact on their attitude. China is trying very hard to become the world leader and to get that moniker. And to be able to do that, they have to gain the confidence of other countries.  &gt;And as long as they're engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it's going to be hard for them to do that.  &gt;But it's more much more complicated than that. I'm -- I shouldn't try to talk China policy in 10 minutes on television here.  A lot less fun when it isn't edited maliciously to the point of lies by the NY Post isn't it?
Hmmmm Tayla didn't manipulate anybody, she told Cassidy very early on how she felt, Grant pretty much played the two against eachother. I know he was feeding her lies but it was objectively weird for Cassidy to latch on to Grant from day 1 and ignore ALL the obvious red flags (Tayla had a crush very early on but didn't even get a chance to get to know him since they shut other ppl off from day dot). It was also extremely weird to bring it up weeks later as a form of pay back against Tayla when this fling had lasted 3 days and she originally matched up with Grant to teach him a lesson for saying she was 'playing a game'.  Also, kissing and hugging right after might have been insensitive, but it was clear, there was a lot of pent up sexual tension and again, it had been a few days of grant and cass getting to know each other goddammit, not a full on relationship style betrayal (obvs I agree he was slimey and totally lied to her, which was a big part of the problem).

‚ÄúI‚Äôd tell all my friends but they‚Äôd never believe me, they‚Äôd think that I‚Äôd finally lost it completely, I‚Äôd show them the stars and the meaning of life, they‚Äôd shut me away... but I‚Äôd be alright‚Äù
who is going to build a module around lizard tits? more so how would someone even do that? even more so... why does it matter? just ignore that module. And furthermore: why do i need to take a side?

His initial comment was about this box not being worth spending the F2P gems he spent months saving up, which was a direct reply to the topic of the post. After having to explain himself multiple times, it came up that he splits his time between this game and others, justifying why he doesn't have the gems to waste on a box like this. When he says that 10 replies into the thread, that's not looking for attention.

Just tell your adjuster what happened. You don‚Äôt need to add ‚Äúmay have‚Äù because they know what that means. It seems like you‚Äôre right, though, that your carrier will find you at fault not because you were backing but because you hit the rear of a parked car.   At the end of the day, this is why you have insurance. As far as high repair costs, any repairs will be made to insurance standards. This means it will be repaired to look like nothing happened. What your insurer won‚Äôt do is pay for whatever the other party wants. I want to say more but I feel like it will get more confusing. Feel free to ask questions!
I use Ally for a saving account and wanted to do more than that. I also had their credit card, which closed not long ago.  They have a fundemental leadership problem. Their products aren't tied together well; your credit card and saving account and business and car loan won't be on the same account. Every one of them are separate. They focus on making new solutions for them, but they're not really solutions customers will find easy to use.  Sure online banking is the hot new thing, but it's already taken off with Square and others. Ally is behind, and will remain behind for as long as their HQ is in Detroit. IMO there is a scalability problem to the talent available there. They've had long enough to figure out these problems and there is no end in sight. They won't figure it out and you're better off investing elsewhere.

I was thinking of that today. Wasn't it supposed to be Black Widow then FaWS and WandaVision after? I'm glad that WandaVision came first. It's so different from the normal stuff and it's gotten me excited to see where Marvel can and will go.
I'm sorry your mom says things like that to you. I've dealt with that slightly and I don't understand it either, knowing how badly someone hurt someone you care about and not being as mad at them.   I would highly suggest therapy, even over the phone. It feels good to get ordeals like that out and say everything you feel about it outloud knowing it won't go anywhere.

Das trifft momentan viel zu stark aufs Herz.   Das eigentlich Schlimme ist ja folgendes Gedankenspiel:  \- Aktuell bundesweit steigende Inzidenz trotz aller Schutzma√ünahmen  \- Diese bewiesenerma√üen verursacht durch einen dominant werdenden Anteil an Mutationsvarianten ([Letzter Stand √ºber 20%](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/video/spahn-corona-schnelltests-100.html), und das ist bereits fast 2 Wochen her)  \- Wir haben aktuell mehrere Hotspots mit einer [dominant werdenden Mutation](https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/zdf-mittagsmagazin/videos/corona-deutschland-britische-mutation-100.html), bei der die Ma√ünahmen nicht wirklich greifen und die Inzidenzien √ºber 150, 200, teilweise 250 liegen   \-&gt; Nicht schwer vorzustellen, dass das der Standard wird, wenn Lockerungen greifen  \- Wir sehen, wie andere L√§nder (Spanien, Portugal, Gro√übrittanien) extreme Spikes von Inzidenzien von √ºber 600 gehabt haben, aufgrund von Lockerungen und Mutationen  \- Wir reden jetzt √ºber l√§nderweite/bundesweite Lockerungen   \---  \--&gt; Wenn wir die Kurven in Spanien und Portugal betrachen, sehen wir, dass die Infektionskurven sich nicht langsam angehoben haben, sondern [unglaublich rapide](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/portugal?country=~PRT) angestiegen sind. In Portugal hat sich die Zahl der Infizierten in 4 Wochen verf√ºnffacht, in Spanien vervierfacht. In Tschechien ist grade die h√∂chste Inzidenz der Welt, was (deutlich auf Inzidenzkarten zu sehen) auch in den Grenzkreisen zu uns hin√ºberschwappt.  \----&gt; Aufgrund des zweiw√∂chigen Verzuges an Testergebnissen liegen die Zahlen logischerweise momentan deutlich h√∂her, als die Statistiken sagen. Da wir es mit einer greifenden Mutation zu tun haben, die potentiell zu einem exponentiellen Anstieg f√ºhrt (oder schon gef√ºhrt hat) und die Inzidenzen scheinbar sehr anf√§llig auf das Verhalten der Leute reagieren, f√ºhrt in der aktuellen (aufw√§rtstrendenden) Situation auch nur jede Bemerkung von Lockerungen nahezu zwangsl√§ufig zu einer Steigerung von Zahlen.  \----------&gt; Jede Steigerung von Zahlen erleichtert es logischerweise, neue Hotspots im exponentiellen Anstieg zu schaffen. Da wir immer einen zweiw√∂chigen Verzug in den Zahlen und einen zus√§tzlich zweiw√∂chigen Verzug in den Ma√ünahmen haben, dauert es mindestens 4, eher 5 oder 6 Wochen, bis sich ein exponentieller Anstieg brechen l√§sst.  Wenn wir auch nur die Zahlen vom niedrigsten 7-Tage-Stand der letzten Wochen nehmen ([7.089](https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/medizin/coronavirus-infizierte-genesene-tote-alle-live-daten-a-242d71d5-554b-47b6-969a-cd920e8821f1)) und eine √§hnliche Kurve anwenden wie in den umliegenden L√§ndern (4x bis 5x in 4 Wochen), landen wir bei einem maximalen Spike von 28k bis 35k als Durchschnitt. Also nochmal h√∂her als die zweite Welle.  Ich finde, es ist seit gut zwei Wochen so ein Gef√ºhl, als ob man mit vollem Tempo versucht, gegen eine Wand zu fahren, und ich habe keine Ahnung, was das bringen soll. Lockerungen jetzt m√ºssen doch im Endeffekt sowieso wieder aufgehoben und noch versch√§rft zur√ºckgenommen werden...

I see the reasoning, but there seems to be no followup from government for people in isolation. They get asked nicely and that's it. Cops should be knocking on doors once or twice a day and cellphone location tracking done at least. At this point it seems to be based on trust, and you can't trust people since most of us are selfish dickheads.

Sad fact for those who don‚Äôt know:  Cheetahs are actually very genetically similar and inbred because of a bottleneck event that happened 10,000 years ago (end of Ice age). This could mean that due to human activity along with their struggle to reproduce because of said genetic similarities, Cheetahs could unfortunately go extinct in the coming centuries

It seems like we're having two related but different conversations here. I'm talking about variants and the motivation to close borders to prevent the variant from getting in (the stated reason why borders were closed back in December), while you're talking about general prevention.   It's important that data should reasonably inform border policy. With the strict restrictions in place (2 negative tests + 2 week quarantine)  a reasonable question to ask is whether those precautionary measures are effective. We ultimately don't have the data to tell either way so it's pointless to argue this point back and forth. Border closures will obviously generally slow spread, but its also possible to to limit border travel to small groups of eligible people with acceptable risk by appropriate precautionary measures so long as they are effective. And again, since we don't have that data, it's pointless to argue about it.  I'm not so much focused on whether olympians should be allowed entry not. My point is how olympians are being allowed entry. If entry, variants, and local numbers are a concern, it doesn't make sense for olympians traveling from all around the world to be exempt from quarantine now does it?

How? Just a simple "Hey, can you take your hood off for me, please?" is all I ever say, and then I move on. It's not a distraction at all.  The only time it becomes a distraction is if the kid starts arguing about it, and then I just ask them to step outside until I can talk to them about it.

My problem with this is that a lot of libertarians have a very binary perspective, as if every policy exists in a vacuum.   An example of this is open borders.  Yes.  As a libertarian, I'd be in favor of something close to open borders, but not in a situation where illegals can get welfare and other assistance.  You can't have both. And frankly, I'm far more offended by welfare than I am by border security and immigration control.
&gt;It‚Äôs a matter of picking the closest one for most of us.  That implies that either of them are close at all. I think "least far away" would be more apt.

Yikes, you are being plenty edgy and weird about it. Something can be dark and disturbing without completely leaning in it (especially a shonen series marketed towards school boys) that scenario you mentioned about showing the moms POV? Just why? They already showed more than enough to convey why the situation was so fucked up. Any more of that would not be ‚Äúelevating the dark undertones‚Äù it would be considered misery and torture porn, not to mention pointless because Kumi‚Äôs resolve was already touched and explained upon.

For a first level, I thought that was pretty good! The level design was nice and straightforward, and having the secret pipe in the underground area was a nice surprise on top of all the coins.  If I had to make a suggestion, though, I think adding a few enemies near the end of the level (with all the short donut-block platforms) would make it more fun. Not a lot of enemies, though! Just two or three Winged Paratroopas/Red Koopas would do it, I think.  If you're interested, here's a code for my ghost house level that I just tweaked earlier today! (01M-C6V-Y0G)
Maybe because it was there prior to Geuse acting out his plans? Subaru was also already beyond the location the White Whale was ordered to stay on.  I learned about this from some random comment (I dont remember if it was on youtube or reddit) so it might be true and it might be false.

This is ridiculous someone is getting rich of this but someone is getting screwed their is no real return on this investment for people that hold.   Their are no dividends being paid out.  The GameStop business model is selling used games at a time that systems and people are all moving to digital downloads.  This is a doomed business.  A large scale pump and dump if you have a brain stay away.
For me it‚Äôs that they‚Äôve got the latency and resistance just right - it feels like a really comfortable pen on paper. Generally apps that use the pencil also have really thought through how they want to use it - I‚Äôve used pens on other systems before, most notably the Surface Pro, but it‚Äôs simply not in the same league, even with a vital feature like palm rejection, which the iPad gets just right. Add to that, with iOS 14 they added a feature where you can tap in the text entry box you want to write in, and then write anywhere on the screen to have it fill in via handwriting recognition. I have to do a lot of filling in of online forms for my job and that one addition to the OS made a massive time saving for me as it felt so much more natural. I‚Äôm only on a gen 1 though, the newer ones are inductive charging I believe.

Yeah, the imam speaks some Turkish with a very heavy accent with occasional Kurdish or Arabic sentence forms. It is the first time I've heard a Turkish-Kurdish pidgin of this kind lol. Also it might be an informal mosque there. It is not common for an imam (appointed and employed by the governmental directorate of religious affairs) to speak for Rudaw.

Yeah, from what we've seen of the elves so far they didn't really seem like the type to have decorated outfits like that. Even Potimas, the leader of the elves, only has a necklace and dagger of sorts as an accessory ([https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/images/3/36/Potimas.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/485?cb=20180816203515](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/kumo-desu-ga-nani-ka/images/3/36/Potimas.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/485?cb=20180816203515)) (no spoilers in the illustration). But then again we saw her wearing a dress in Episode 1 so they probably have clothes for special occasions.  Personally I'd suggest removing the ones around the waist and possibly the tiara but keeping the rest. But frankly I think it looks great anyway.  In any case, great work! Looking forward to seeing the finished version.

This was pretty damn on point.  Taylor positions herself as an authority on these issues and someone who can educate others on these topics.

Well, it's kind of a hard thing to answer, but I'll give it a try:  Self-preservation: doing something to protect yourself or to survive.   Selfishness: doing something that benefits you, at a cost to other people.   Self-preservation is not always selfish, but it can be. If you've seen the movie Titanic, the villain of the movie (Rose's fiance), trying to survive the sinking of the ship, grabs a child on the deck and pretends that the child is his, so that he can get in a lifeboat, even though there are people who need to be saved more quickly than him. He's doing it to save his own life, but it's likely going to kill other people who won't get a spot on the lifeboat now. What he's doing is self-preservation, but it's also very selfish.
 As someone with mental health issues who relies heavily on my relationship with my therapist, just the though that an actual therapist could have tweets out there like this and still be licensed makes me incredibly anxious. Her tweets are incredibly damaging to a plethora of different groups, many of which I‚Äôm a part of, but it‚Äôs the fact that she was a mental health counselor that‚Äôs affecting me the worst. And she was in that role (or at the very least pursuing it) WHILE she was making these tweets. That is so disturbing.

I discovered it right away when I first started using LibreOffice back in 2016 but I prefer the menus style rather than stupid tabs. I hated that on MS Office as well.

PSA to all anime-onlies who're getting discouraged by all the comments about it being cringe:  **It gets better. Like, a lot better.**  To reach the peak of this series, we'll probably need to wait for a S3 unless they go the 2-cour route. However, the main issues that people have with this series (Spineless MC, trashy harem, etc.) are getting fixed this season. They don't get *completely* fixed, but their development actually happens (some of it, quite a bit actually). The only issue that is persistent is the deadbeat pacing of the series: When it airs, I'd recommend waiting for the run to finish and then binging it. It'll be difficult to enjoy otherwise imho (coming from a weekly consuming manga reader).  Otherwise, the show is setup to blindside you if you only thought of it as nothing more than self-insert wish-fulfillment MC who's trashy and now has a bunch of girls fawning over him. I highly recommend you at least try it out when it airs and make your own opinion of it.  Manga reader out.
You're welcome.

Some municipalities already have compost waste management in addition to regular waste and recyclables (Denver county does this but it‚Äôs an additional service you have to pay for). And this technology (anaerobic digestion to create methane) is already used for wastewater plants. In the U.S. it‚Äôs up to municipalities to decide if they want to implement anaerobic digestion and augment their plants (costly and takes years for investment to be paid off from energy savings). A lot of water and waste water management systems in the U.S. are very old and require maintenance and retrofitting. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a lot easier to convince citizens that infrastructure spending should go to a new road than to much needed improvements for their decades old water and wastewater systems.

I'm not sure how to speak to you because the ignorance is hard to wrap my head around. I mean.. hypothetically... would you or would you not be willing to give the English language an overhaul, literally change how it's spoken and then convince the entire country to speak it that way, Texans included? All of that to fight linguistic sexism? Would that be ridiculous or impossible somehow?  Do you like, speak any languages? Do you know what it would mean to make a gendered language non-gendered? Most importantly how even dare you sit there behind your keyboard listening to gunshots and tell billions of people on other continents that their native languages should change because they're sexist.   I actually live in Europe and you know what, we have bigger problems than gendered suffixes. Nobody cares. Maybe stop worrying about French enbys and focus on getting a universal healthcare. Like damn. I just can't with the internet.

tldr; Bitcoin is not 5.000% more valuable than the USD. There are currently 18.5 million Bitcoins in existence, and it is estimated that there will be 21 million in existence. Bitcoin has a limited supply, which tells us that it can‚Äôt go down in value indefinitely. There is no relation between bitcoin wallet addresses and people‚Äôs physical addresses, making it almost impossible to track the sender and recipient of a transaction.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article.

I don‚Äôt believe in putting crypto in cold storage and forgetting about it for years. I actively look at my portfolio to see how it‚Äôs doing from day to day, but I don‚Äôt worry about the dips. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre one of those people who has 10m btt which is a lot of money, you forget about the coins and move on to other things. Well let‚Äôs say the project doesn‚Äôt develop along or the developers stop caring about the project. Now the trading volume drops to low levels and it‚Äôs removed from exchanges. Now you screwed yourself because you can‚Äôt even sell off the coins you have to make some of the money back. You now sit on a coin you can‚Äôt do a single thing with. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Could just be me but I‚Äôve seen plenty of coins with low trading volume and people getting stuck with coins that are worthless

The truly sad part of this is that they did fix this issue ( at one point prior Kate release ) then after she dropped the issue came back, the reason i mention this is they should already know how to fix it just a matter of doing it ( unless there is more complications in the code that cause the same result ) who knows

Wheel is an options strategy involving selling a cash secured put and waiting to be assigned. If you dont, you get the cash for the premium, do it again. If you do, you end up with the 100 shares. From there, sell covered calls, collecting premiums. Rinse repeat, aka wheeling.

Is this implying that biodiversity has decreased as CO2 has risen from 280 to 415 ppm in the last 200 years. And alarmists claiming we are in a mass extinction event due to this rise.   I think experiments controlling essential requirements for plants do not support your claims. Particularly with experiments using CO2 as the control. These results have transitioned from the lab to the agricultural industry in the form of controlling the CO2 concentration in greenhouses. Increasing CO2 above 415 ppm, not reducing it.

Ok I agree, I wrote it wrong.  My new version is:  By talking about bad stuff that happens to men, other males may get encouraged to stand up for themselves by seeing that they're not alone (if they felt like they were)  Does it have any flaws? Probably, but I like seeing flaws in my opinions being pointed out so that they can get better.
Does the water stop when you power it off? That would point towards a control, pressure switch or pressure switch hose problem.  If the water continues to fill say if you yank the plug out of the outlet then your water valve is sticking open.

Plenty of people keep their creativity when they grow up. Typically it's people with healthy upbringings and a cynical eye for societal norms.     Generally, society beats creativity out of us in favor of falling in line and conforming to the "norms" people in power want from us, but that's a whole ass discussion

Yup.
It‚Äôs important to remember in your analysis that our genes are in control, not our brains. The desire to help others, altruism, is a function of the genes wanting to survive. And example of this on the other end of the spectrum is gonorrhea. It‚Äôs a bacteria that lyses itself when nutrition is low. The lysing stimulates an immune response in the host causing blood flow to that area. Instant nutrition, and the genes of the surviving cells continues. Also those free floating genes can get picked up by other cells, of the same genus or not.   Genes are fully in control. People that decide not to have children may help others in their family who do have children, thus perpetuating genes. Any aberrations to that logic are just modern manifestations.

I definitely see some yo-yoing between divisions in the upper leagues. I may even bottle promotion on purpose (well, I won't technically bottle it, but won't actively look to get promoted in the first season) after I reach the championship, just so I can get some dough and some reputation boost, and then maybe go to the prem with a side capable of finishing above 15th place in the second or third season
Yeah, seems that way, sadly. Hard to know without PMO being any sort of playable (as far as I know). Sucks hell out of a straw.  I do think you did a good job though! Best of luck to ya.

This just happened to me. It was shitty and awkward.   &amp;#x200B;  Getting fired for job hunting is probably illegal where OP is, but employers can always find a "reason" if they want to. If not, say you don't get the job but everyone knows you're looking. That's awkward at best and could potentially piss some people off. Think scorned mentor figure, stressed upper manager dealing with the turnover, etc.
Should have just put It on youtube
I would imagine it's an instinctive thing. We're social animals, with instincts revolving around between rescuing those in our tribe and avoiding potentially dangerous situations. You hear a human screaming, and it's likely a valued person from your tribe suffering a horrible fate, which means you need to act immediately to rescue or avoid.  Think about if your neighbor gets eaten by a bear in the woods. You're going to run the other way so fast if you hear them screaming like that... It would save your life. Those instincts get reinforced.  Also there's something about how auditory signals are hardwired into the brain. You can react more quickly to sounds than you can to things you see, so it wouldn't surprise me if the lizard part of your brain is setting off all the alarm bells its can before you can even see the problem.  This is half conjecture on my part, and half conjecture based on science that I heard from radiolab... so take it with a grain of salt. But that would be my best guess.

TLDR: AP guns, torp spam, useful consumables  Super fast torp reload (\~60 seconds), decent damage torps. Smoke + Hydro lets you bully other DDs. The AP shells actually do really good damage (not even sure a DD is allowed to do AP damage. lol) with pretty good turret traverse and reload times. Ships handle pretty good too, like a more sluggish USN ship.  Overall the combination of traits really appeals to me and my playstyle. I'm an aggressive player so I hate sitting back, and the German DDs allow me to be aggressive enough to be fun, so long as I respect their limitations. The T9 Z-46 was my favorite of the whole line, but the -52 is pretty good also.

Ah nice. We‚Äôre a independent used car dealership and obviously in the UK so I think things work a little differently here.   Most of my commission comes from finance commissions and warranty commissions, plus a base commission on every car, whether it‚Äôs sold at a loss or a profit. On a finance sale for someone with average credit, taking a warranty on a basic car like a bmw or mercedes I‚Äôll make around ¬£300

&gt;I disagree. Capitalism has been around much longer.  Markets have, but not capitalist markets.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Erode? Or reinforce and exploit?  Erode the independent power of the state, reinforce the power of the state used on behalf of multinationals.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I'm not sure how that could ever happen under any circumstances, even without multinationals.  Maybe not entirely, but plenty of European countries heavily restrict it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It is to me. The undeclared edit is the act of a dishonest person. There is no point having a conversation with someone who will happily go back and change what they said. Let me know if you ever decide to be honest. Until then, have a nice day.  Lol dude I definitely did not edit the luddite comment, in response to your post. I may have right after I posted it though. That question was really half in jest anyway. But have a good day regardless.

The realism crisis, to the uneducated eye it always OMG FOH REALS!!!! NO WAY!!   For those of us who are artists, either self taught or college educated. I appreciate  the commitment but the skill is average, too many novice mistakes that keep pulling my eye away.  Copying a photograph rarely translates well, and i agree there was little to no thought to captivate or innoviate, just more tried and tested plain realism.   Hell most of these realism artists have no free hand skill, and just obsessively slave over a projected image. Mindlessly copying the inaccuracies from the optics  of the camera, without using their knowlege of shape, forms and tones. If they even have it.

On the Series X I had a few bugs but the game was still very much so playable for me. I have almost 275 hours in. Honestly I fucking love the game. Yeah the bugs on release were a pain in the ass, but they resolved a lot of issues early on putting the game in a much more stable state. I know a lot was cut and I know a lot is unfinished... so on and so forth, but in its current state, I have a blast playing it. I understand people expected more and they have a right to be bummed, but I went into Cyberpunk knowing only that it was like a futuristic Gta. It ended up being so much more. I loved the depth the the storylines and the complexity of the world. I can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for V‚Äôs adventure.

My 40th is coming up too! I already had a very boring 39th covid-birthday and figured I was lucky it wasn't my 40th and covid would be over by now.  My solution: I've decided to swap years. I'll go straight to 41 now, and next year I'll catch up and become 40 after all - and hopefully have an actual party! ;)  If you want a big celebration: do it next year too, and become 41 this year. ;) (*Or 39+... Or 40-... Or 3-10...* - I've heard so many 40-in-denial excuses)

 &gt;You could make the same argument for age/race/specie, as in ''refer to me as a 2 year old asian cat" and see where that takes us.  You actually can't, but I get what you're saying. I'm just illustrating how easy it is not to throw a fit, rather than offering a slam dunk argument in favor of pronoun flexibility (which I am in favor of, in the interest of transparency).   But you have a birthday, and a certain amount of time has passed since then. Your age is just a fact. The same is true for species, as the process of speciation is an established fact. Like the label of what species you are is not really up for interpretation in any ambiguous way.   Race is similar, if not a bit more flexible. Maybe I'm about to burn bridges with some of the proper liberals, but at a certain point defining someone as being one race vs  another becomes kind of arbitrary in itself. Like it's a fact that you had parents, and they had parents, and so on, and they came from a specific part of the world. That's traceable. But in some ways the lines we draw between ourselves don't really have as much ultimate significance as we sometimes think they do. Now, I don't think it's acceptable for someone to just decide, "I identify as a race which I am evidently not", if only *because* of how much value we place in our heritage, and because the definition of race is so firmly glued to lineage, which itself is simply another unambiguous fact which is not open to interpretation.   But gender is different. Beyond a flawed high school understanding, there simply isn't a genetic argument to draw a line in the sand to say "there are two, and this is how we draw the line". That's the entire purpose of the original post haha. And beyond that, we have traditions and expectations. The reason some people question the gender that was placed on them is simply because these traditions aren't always a good thing for every person in every situation. Even the obsession with genitals falls apart really quickly, since people are just born with different configurations sometimes. And if someone damages or loses theirs...we would never say that they lost their gender. So clearly their presence itself isn't the determining factor. What really is?   Anyway, hope this doesn't rattle the nest, just sharing some honest thoughts. I'm not the gender police, everyone is free to have their own opinion on the matter
Well I'm definitely serving that up!
That's my entire point - a *united* fan (read: not me) brought up Klopp's comments on the grass 3 years ago.  *I* didn't bring them up. Are you confused or is English not your first language? I'm genuinely asking because what I wrote was pretty clear.   Just to explain in simple English if it helps:  1) someone made a sensible, logical comment of Ole's (rightful) complaints  2) because that person had a Liverpool flair, a bitter United fan replied mocking Klopp's comments on grass - nothing to do with what that person said, referees, or Ole  3) it got heavily upvoted by salty United fans such as yourself

I already told you my life experience.   I was homeless for a short while in my early twenties.   I had more than enough resources to pull myself out of poverty. And I pay it forward by helping the homeless.   I tried to have a city law passed where homeless people could use a P.O. box as their "residency" for applying to jobs. This is a known barrier to employment and something that was rejected by out-of-touch feel-good people like you.   You've owned houses and had a career. Um... Ok? Good for you dude.

I really, really love Novik - but be aware this is more YA than Uprooted and Spinning Silver. I was excited for a dark and horrible take on wizard school with shades of Hunger Games - and although the setting is grim at face, it's quite upbeat and teen-drama-y in tone. Where it aims for high stakes or tension, it mostly misses; where it aims for charm and popcorn material, it mostly hits.   If you want a grimly funny slice-of-lifey exploration of the fact that Hogwarts should have better child safeguarding, this might be your jam. Just take the blub with a pinch of salt!

The Gith and Mind Flayers are basically aliens who crashed and some of their "magical" equipment is sprinkled across shipwrecks. Because these items are actually really advanced pieces of technology, their enchantments can't be paused by an Anti-Magic Zone.  The Dwarves and Drow are both from the Underdark, and they have a direct rivalry because the dwarves keep accidentally mining into drow territories and drow keep trying to claim the artificial caverns of dwarvish mines.  Elves have Italian accents, and Elven is almost a direc translation of Italian. I decided on this because the PHB mentions that humans sprinkle bits of other languages into Common, directly referencing Orc swears and Elven musical expressions. Since English uses Italian musical expressions, I just went "good enough." Except for some words, which I made up as replacements mainly for the naming conventions. Those words are present as synonyms, and rarely used in a context other than names.  There is no God of Death. Death is just a thing that happens. However, there is a pantheon of Death gods, lead by Motreap the Psychopomp. The other members are the gods are mainly patrons of each of the afterlives, plus an Elven god of Rebirth.  Because there are eight Gods of the Hells, each of them only count as 1/8 of a vote in the Court of Death. This is a major point of contention for them, and they argue that they should be worth a full vote each.  Motreap, as the head of the pantheon, is able to veto any decision, but usually doesn't because he has so much to do during any given night that it's just not worth the energy.

Well wishes friend
Well we want the area enough that we are bidding at our max - not our max budget mind you, but our max 'we're not house poor' pricing. The main issue we're grappling with is that it is very possible that we are next in line and just keep getting bumped out by one buyer - last house only had 4-5 bids including ours. But we also know that just as things have changed in the positive direction, they could also level out as pretty much everyone has been wrong in predicting this spike.
There are no more rules on how many people are allowed anywhere. We make the rules now.
The point is his response was a very different answer than if he was confident he hadn't done/said anything wrong. It's not that he's admitting he did anything, but by how he responded he's left open that possibility and is acknowledging it.   &gt; Now if he touched someone inappropriately or did something bad like that?   One of the allegations is that he kissed a woman on her lips against her will.  &gt; People get offended and take things personally at times when there is no intent to do so from the other person.  Your intent is not what's important in harassment allegations. It can be a mitigating factor, but it's not the deciding factor for a reason - otherwise the "I was just joking" or "I thought s/he wanted it" excuses would just always win out because intent is very difficult to prove.   This does not seem like a situation of smoke without fire. It doesn't necessarily mean his behavior was egregiously bad, but at the least it's worth investigating and if some of the allegations are true (such as kissing against the woman's will) he does need to be removed from office. That's not "people being people" that's sexual assault.

I tend to think about a few elements of each nation I work on.  What are there beliefs-religion, legends and susperstitions  Goverment-how do they rule and what laws do they have. I like to tie in there religion and aspects of there surrondings. Maybe bees are sacred because of there honey so those with the most bees get to rule.   What do they build and what does it look like-It usually be effected by culture , region and building materials.  What do they wear-Again this will often come down to religion, culture and region. Not to many fur clad barbarians in the deep jungle.   What does there landscapes look like-I like to add unique plants or animals to the area to give it some flair.   What are there traditions-What things do these people do from habit and story.  Economy/education-I like to spend a little bit of time considering the poverty level, road networks, trade, type of goods they have and schooling.  Notable people/History-where do they come from and who brought them there, as well as who is part of there society today.

I‚Äôve discussed why it‚Äôs been let down already, and I‚Äôm sure you all know it as well, so I‚Äôll skip that for now. I‚Äôve already spoken a lot about this show generally in my [WT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/d5j198/wt_aura_battler_dunbine_animes_inventive_first/) of it, so I‚Äôm going to try not to repeat myself *too* much.  At the heart of Dunbine is a cautionary tale about the dynamics of power in its many forms. Everything in the show is motivated by the possession and use of power, which despite Drake‚Äôs simplistic view of it at the start of the show proves inaccurate, as the manner in which his own threatening power motivates varied and nuanced actions from those opposed and surrounding him. Even once everything gets up-ended after the move to Upper Earth the nature of these power dynamics remains prominently on the forefront of the story. The way this theme is interwoven into so many facets of the narrative is quite impressive and lends the work incredible thematic cohesion. From this come forth topics such as the tribulations of righteousness, the dangers of advanced technology, the double-edged nature of motivations, sacrifice, and the effects of one‚Äôs attachments among others.   This theme of power results in quite the fascinating characterization for several characters, from Show who struggles with living up to the expectations he poses for himself and strives to be heroic ‚Äînot in the sense that he wants to be a hero, but that he strives to do things which would place him in such a category‚Äî but finds himself repeatedly short of living up to that, and as a result finds himself ever the more willing to risk first himself and later others as the situation grows more desperate, in order to accomplish their goals, which ultimately results in his death. This struggle towards ‚Äòheroism‚Äô is all the more poignant because it‚Äôs nestled within the show‚Äôs strong anti-escapist message, which I‚Äôll get more into later. Marvel follows a near identical arc, with the distinction that she loses heart more easily while being more in control of herself. Their shared arc makes them perfectly complementary throughout the narrative and makes their romantic feelings for one another all the more interesting on top of the myriad factors affecting their circumstances. Elmelie also has a strong, if underutilized arc, where her rebellion against her family‚Äôs tyranny begins with as open and straightforward opposition as she can manage, until the situations she finds herself in begin to force her to be shrewder, until she finally ends up manipulating her father and attempt to assassinate her mother in displays of subterfuge and underhanded methods, in a fashion that mirrors but feels distinct from the overarching narrative‚Äôs shifting moral boundaries.  I also appreciate how this show rails against the common element of escapism and the power fantasy that is invoked by several fantasy and mecha stories, confronting us with the likely outcomes of these circumstances and showing that treating the premise as a means of wish fulfillment leads to negative outcomes. It also uses its Isekai premise more creatively than most series even today; I can‚Äôt think of more than a handful of examples that have done better.  The series looks really nice most of the time. I adore Kogawa‚Äôs character designs and the artstyle is beautiful. There‚Äôs a lot of impressive and captivating visuals throughout the show, but by virtue of being a long-running show with less budget than its contemporaries it can‚Äôt help but dip every so often.  The last arc is undoubtedly a mess, with less than a handful standout episodes and with a lot of it feeling woefully repetitive and like the plot didn‚Äôt move an inch. The lack of progress for the main characters can be a narrative tool, as the show displays in its earlier portions where the heroes were met with repeated failures for almost a full cour, but during that the plot was still marching on in the background, not to mention actual worldbuilding and scheming going on back then. Earlier portions in the show have their issues ‚Äîsome episodes are unnecessary and that stretch of episodes after Elmelie escapes drags pretty bad‚Äî but the Upper Earth section takes the cake, and I have no idea how audiences preferred it over the actual fantasy sections. The arc also derails so many character arcs that could have had far better integration, such as Neal‚Äôs struggles with being a proper leader, Jacoba Aon‚Äôs change of heart and subsequent transportation of the battlers to Upper Earth, wherever Keen‚Äôs character arc was intended to go, and the political maneuvering that was hinted at from Ciela and the other countries. It‚Äôs such a shame the series had to spin its wheels and ultimately end on a low note.  Nevertheless, I still like the series on the whole, particularly as I seem to occupy myself with concerns over thematics more than most, but it is undoubtedly flawed. I frankly expected this Rewatch to sour my opinion on the show, the awful pacing and different nature of the last arc still ripe on my mind, but surprisingly enough I don‚Äôt think any less of the show. A rough journey it was, but it is one I nonetheless treasure and look back upon most fondly still. **7/10**  Thanks a lot for partaking in this Rewatch with me, everyone!  ---   **Next Rewatch Shilling**  Despite my better judgement I have decided to host another Rewatch for a fantasy series, but thankfully this one is a mere two episodes. The media in question is the 1996 *Fire Emblem* OVA, which is an adaptation of the 1994 video game *Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazou*. You can blame u/Shimmering-Sky for this, since she put the idea of hosting an April fools Rewatch in my head and the OVA happened to be on my mind around that time. In any case it‚Äôs more or less the opposite of this Rewatch, a short experiment as opposed to a fifty-episode Behemoth.
Thank youuu!

Youre right. I mean. I wish I could ask her what I could do to help her. But I mean. That‚Äôs not possible clearly. I haven‚Äôt heard from her. But you‚Äôre absolutely right about the book, a friend of mine said something similar and then said she owed me an amends.   Nobody owes me anything. I hope she takes that energy and utilizes it for her own sobriety :/

There is a fine line to walk as a streamer, yes your primary concern is the stream itself and entertaining but you also have a responsibility to moderate and guide your chat. The difference is that often that responsibility is through asking folks to calm down or to ask them to stop doing something since you can't always perform mod actions yourself as you'd be spending the entire stream with that.  A lot of the problem here isn't that they don't moderate enough, it's that they lack enough help from a mod team to help curb the problem children if chat starts to take things too far.  Yes, the community needs to take responsibility for their actions but the talents do share part of the blame, though that blame is reduced by the fact that they do ask people to stop doing it. Thinking that a talent isn't responsible for what their chat evolves into is pretty narrow, you as the streamer can and do shape your community and chat as you see fit. Unfortunately, due to the size of the audiences we're now at a point where it's very difficult if not nearly impossible to curb certain behaviors without large mod teams dedicated to helping nudge people away from problematic behaviors.

Yeah, they're anti-White, anti-Jewish and anti-Asian. Now I explain why: -Cuomo and De Blasio targeted and blamed the Jewish community for the Coronavirus emergency -Rashida Tlaib said that the Holocaust give her a "calming feeling" -Ilhan Omar accused the Jews of having a Dual Loyalty -They hate Asians because they consider them as Whites and they accuse them of being anti-Black -They come to the same conclusion for Jews, comparing the Israelis to the "evil Whites" that kill the "innocent Palestinians" in the same way the "evil Whites" kill the Blacks

You realize that by equating the Westside with that particular lifestyle you're also disregarding all the regular folk, including Latinos, who are not at all rich elites and are constantly erased by people, even Angelenos, whose only idea of the Westside is avocado toast, fresh pressed juices, Rodeo Drive, Erewhon, and affluent white people.  I'm totally down with your point about the Westside overshadowing the rest of LA, but the solution isn't to shit on it lol. Love your whole city, ma dude.

It‚Äôs the over-emphasis on privilege unrelated to the community in question. LGBT+ communities shouldn‚Äôt constantly be emphasizing white privilege, neither should this community.

This comment makes sense except when racism is actively occurring.

I would seriously get my hands on some medical equipment and make sure I kept them alive for as long as possible while I just did some horrible truly frighteningly terrible things to them. I might even try and make sure they lived so they had to live with what I did to them the rest of their life so every time they looked in the mirror or even just woke up in the morning they'd be confronted by what I did to them.

If they Ban or even think of suspending Picard for this, I'm Boycotting this OW for good and I don't care if my own own Outfit kicks me for doing so. (they wouldn't dare, I've been with them since 2013) ...but I won't flinch.  The Devs have already been going too far down that RabbitHole of trying to protect their own Feelings over actually creating a quality product with wide appeal.  They might as well get Tattoos of Kamela Harris and Elizabeth Warren on their scrawny noodle arms while they're at it because it's all just meaningless Symbolism which never actually materializes into real "justice" for anyone.
&gt;Also, Frisk only 'smiles as he runs' from enemies when he does a complete pacifist run.   Sans makes it sound like Frisk has done this before, and why shouldn't it apply to all situations where Frisk runs away? This is not the path of a pacifist. This is the path of the neutral. The only difference is that you don't kill, and Frisk remains 'true to himself' without any influence from anything.  &gt;Chara's lines of impatience in new home are mostly after you've already Genocided damn near the entire underground, in an area that Chara knows is close to the end of the underground. They grow impatient over the course of genociding everything.  And this is the only path where Chara leads to some kind of ending personally. It is obvious that his impatience is not caused by your murders, but by the fact that he has something to strive for. And he is impatient throughout the genocide.  &gt;The 'shortened' messages are slightly shortened, but that's just as easily to help meta worldbuild the feeling of playing as a player that only wants to grind on enemies and doesn't care about the storyline.  It doesn't matter.  &gt;Would she be willing to secretly tell you she likes you via check while openly (where other monsters might hear) acting mean towards you with every other comment she makes? Maybe. Would she be willing to secretly give you a check message and then audibly refute it? That seems weird.  &gt;But if Chara's been getting check messages from monsters directly, why's Tsunderplane's check so weird?   Because it doesn't always come from monsters, but it's not particularly rare that we can say that the information probably comes from them. There are many cases where information can't come from monsters, but there are also cases that can't come from Chara alone. Why should there be only two extremes?  &gt;Chara knows Loox's last name,  Which Loox could have said itself.  &gt;They know why snowdrake fights,  Do you think that the teenager was alive at the time when was alive Chara?  https://nochocolate.tumblr.com/post/136361432605/ive-been-playing-through-again-and-i-noticed-some  https://nochocolate.tumblr.com/post/142636312485/not-ready-for-prime-time-do-not-post  Undyne, who is older than this monster, doesn't know Toriel, and asks Asgore that this is his ex. Papyrus also doesn't know Toriel or what she looks like. Undyne also never saw humans. It's been a very long time. And if think logically, Chara was here also may not know about him. It's impossible for so little time to pass. Toriel even says that it's been a very long time since the last human fell before Frisk, but how long has it been in ALL that time? Even more.  &gt;Aaron's got horsepower and knowledge of his magic bullet patterns, &amp; Chara knows the name of Knight Knight's weapon to name a few. All of these are pretty random pieces of info for monsters to tell you themselves in the heat of battle.  I see no reason for them not to give this information. Because monsters are rarely the ones who take battle very seriously, especially considering that through this battle, they can often just manifest themselves rather than fight for real. A lot of monsters have to do with the sentimental part. So they can easily do it. And this is more likely than thinking that a child who died, perhaps hundreds of years ago, knows the personal information of many monsters. And WHY would Chara say that information in this situation (except about bullet patterns)? The same question.

All I know is Season 1 was 70 days long and Season 2 was 91 days...so I'm assuming that this season would also be around the 91 day mark, so it should be ending around March 16th which is a Tuesday. Hopefully we get more info this coming Tuesday or this Thursday with an ITV article.

You don't have to press charges if you don't want to. You are, however, obligated to support victims who do want to come forward, even if it's painful or it means consequences that don't favor you. #MeToo applies here.  It doesn't matter what the authorities say, to be blunt. They're the system that defends high-profile abusers day-in and day-out. Your brother was victim blamed by that same system. Now he wants to validate himself publicly. If your cousin is the person you think he is, he should be on board as well.

Definitely affects my appetite as well. In a way its not a problem since I'm doing intermittent fasting, so this \*sorta\* helps. However, my eating window overlaps with my time on meds, and I need to schedule a meal while I'm still on my meds (and stick to it) and make sure I do get all the calories I need. When I'm off meds for dinner, I eat a big meal and enjoy myself. During the day when I have a late lunch, I keep it simple and nutritious (like a meal shake or chicken salad), so I can scarf it down even if I'm not enjoying it.
