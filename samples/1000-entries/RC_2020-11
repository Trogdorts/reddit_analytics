Little kids can be brutal at times but Older Teens are just godawful.  One boy just straight  up beat the crap outta of this Transboy  with his buddies in my school's restroom during my sophomore  year. The poor guy was so traumatized  that he had to use the teacher's  toilet  for the rest of the school year.
Sometimes I forget just how dangerous this sport is.

I highly recommend Du Chinese reader for listening and reading. I'm only a beginner but I've learned a lot of vocabulary, grammar, and how sentences work thanks to the app. I even practice my pronunciation with it by playing some parts of the story multiple times and copying the pronunciation.   They organise their stories/articles into levels and they're all entertaining and the audio is easy to follow (You get to learn about chinese culture too). You can change the speed of the audio to however fast or slow you want. The english translation is displayed at the top of each story but you can choose to tap certain words and it will display only the definition and play the sound.
&gt; in english  Oh no, not English.
I mean I'll talk about it if people want to but I'm satisfied with gently poking fun. At the end of the day it's just a tv show.

Kobe Bryant was a rapist, not to mention highly irresponsible flying a helicopter with children in bad weather and Sean Connery was a sexist and tax exile. I don't really care about either of them dying.  They weren't bad enough to wish death upon, but why the fuck are people sad?

What do you mean?? The phishy pussy is an absolute classique!
Had the same thing happen to me. Heat up the hot end and get something around the same diameter of the filament ( I had a set of metal picks and one was L shaped. You can also use an old brass coat hanger to make one etc) this should allow you to access the PTFE tube from the maintenance door on the side and push the old filament down into the tube enough to start loading new filament on top of the old piece. The new filament should then help push it all the way through the hot end while also loading the new filament.

I haven't seen those! Nic Hankins has some awesome pieces in his online gallery in the Ross style that I'm sure took longer than 30 mins though. He does the "Keeping the Dream Alive" videos on the Ross channel and he's super talented.   Kevins paintings feel very "soft" relative to Bob's though, and there are a handful of paintings I've redone with more Kevin techniques, but I ended up preferring my originals lol.   I definitely want to kind of find my own middle point, but I've got a ways to go!

So, what's up now? Any streams from them?
Practically impossible since polling is so far outside the margin for error for him to win legitimately.  They'd have to throw out hundreds of thousands of Biden votes in a bunch of states to do it (which some of them will definitely be trying).  Even if he "wins" the electoral college it could very well wind up 55/45 in Biden's favor or more.  People will *not* accept that again.

Ah, the dreaded judge and executioner.
A file removes material as it moves, adding more force can help remove more material but not by a considerable margin. you want enough force to dig into the metal so the file will work but adding more can lead to cuts that are deeper than you want or even chipping the blade or braking the file   If there is an area you want to file, you just need to run the file arcoss that area more, not necessarily harder. files are also pretty slow compared to things like beltsanders and grinders. if you can, use a belt sander for heavy stock removal and a file to refine the shape and sand paper for surface finish.
Yeah I think

The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that sex isn‚Äôt something you have sole responsibility for. Both of you have responsibility. When you break something, nobody else has to be involved - it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs impossible for a drunk person to break anything on their own. But it *is* impossible for a drunk person to have sex without anyone else (that‚Äôs just masturbation) - everyone involved with the sex also has a responsibility to ensure, at a minimum, that everyone consents and won‚Äôt end up regretting it the next day (it would be absurd to say that it‚Äôs ok to have sex if only one person consents). If the drunk person can‚Äôt do it, then the other person has to.
What the fuck happened can some please fill me in?
Ah - okay. I didn't read that into it.

I broke up with a boyfriend of two years at around 19 y/o for this exact reason. But like other users have mentioned, there are several factors to consider. Is it a physical appearance thing? Did she lose or gain weight? Hygiene? Bad habits? Etc.   My level of attraction stems a lot from personality&gt;appearance so my ex didn‚Äôt change physically. I just found myself really turned off by him and his personality over time and that‚Äôs okay. People grow and change and sometimes are not really meant to be together forever. To this day, I don‚Äôt regret my decision.  I would consider these factors and definitely try to be communicative with your partner about it.

Everything is worse in JC4.  I'm pretty sure that the biggest reason they had to tone down the graphics a lot in JC4 was because JC3 nearly melted the consoles because the graphics were so intense.  There were so many issues with the game freezing and crashing during big set pieces and battles/explosions. They didn't want a repeat with JC4, so they nerfed the graphics quite a bit to get a stable framerate on the consoles. I know that people have said they made some improvements with the graphics in JC4 since the game was launched, but on PC it still looks really bad compared to JC3.

   Strongest and weakest position group on the team?  The 49ers strongest position group is linebacker - if not for injuries it would easily be the DL. But with Fred Warner, who‚Äôs fast approaching top 3 LB territory, Dre Greenlaw, one of the best young LBs in the league, and Kwon Alexander as well - it‚Äôs easily our LB corps. Weakest I would have to say is our DL group at the moment. If not for injuries, it would be the best, but we have barely any playmakers left on that DL. Hoping that Jordan Willis can make an impact.

Countertop frozen pizza cooker. I've also used it for a whole lot of other stuff.  I got it as a Christmas gift one year and I ended up using it a whole lot more than I expected.  It's basically a rotating metal plate that spins your pizza between 2 heating elements (above and below).  It crisps the crust better than any method I've used in the oven (on the rack, pizza stone, on a sheet, etc) and manages to get the frozen pepperoni to do that fancy curl up. Like, I'm not exaggerating when I say it improves the quality of pizza.  It makes Red Baron taste fricken delicious.

US history is drowning in terms like separate but equal, literacy tests, poll taxes, open ballot, etc where certain demographics were/are systematically disadvantaged. If you read through the history of the Civil Rights movement, Jim Crow, women's suffrage, Black Panther's guns, and Gay rights movement, you would have to be insane to assume that all policies will be acted out in good faith in this gigantic country we call USA.

Yep. Add any element augment and keep the teostra one untill velkhana pops up. It's way faster to add element 1 and upgrade it than is to get higher elemental ones right away.
If you want to collect the figures, the best tip is: Start with the ones you think look the coolest. You got Siege and Earthrise (Earthrise is the new one but Siege can still be found on shelves) for a G1 style and aesthetic. You got the Studio Series for the Bayformers. Get what YOU like, not what WE like.  As to shows and everything well...there's a lot. A LOT. IMO might as well start with the Netflix War For Cybertron series. Siege is out, 6 episodes, Earthrise is coming soon(?). But 6 episodes is not a big investment of time really. It's enough to see if you want to continue on.  If you do want more, the free streaming app Tubi has nearly every Transformers series you can stream. For free. With ads, but they're not that bad, about a regular TV broadcast worth of ads. Not like some places that put 2 minutes of ads every 2 minutes.  As for comics...don't worry about them right now. Seriously, don't. If you dive off the deep end and try to get every back issue, even in trade paperback form, that's hundreds of dollars of material. Just see if you like the few toys and the few series first. Then find what you like most. Then get comics based off of what you enjoy most.   Video games are currently a tough nut. No one has the rights (that I'm aware of) for a proper video game. Just phone app crap. Console game wise, the last company lost the rights years ago and no one has taken them since. So they could be hard to find. That said. You can possibly find 3 good ones at Gamestop. The first is Transformers Devastation, for just about every console from the PS3/360 era up. I got mine on PS4. It's very much a love letter to G1. Bit short. But it is not bad.  On the Xbox 360, if you still got one, are two great games. You can't play the multiplayer anymore (sadly), but the storyline is still great. "War For Cybertron" and "Fall of Cybertron" are their names, and in that order. Fall is the sequel to War. They may have been on PS3 also not sure. Regardless, neither is backwards compatible with the Xbox one or PS4. So, you need the old consoles to play them.  If you want lore, hit up the tfwiki I say. Read some articles. On history, on geography of Cybertron, on whatever. There's some great books that been published over the past few years. Not 'Covenant of Primus' even though it's all lore, it's also all junk. But the "Allspark Almanacs" for Animated are amazing for example, as are a few other books. Just go to your favorite book retailer (I like thriftbooks myself) and search up Transformers books. See your options, check in detail on the ones that interest you. Ask us about this or that book if you want.  But seriously: Start with what YOU like, start a bit slow so you don't feel like you wasted (too much) money if you want to get out of it, and enjoy what you enjoy.

Sounds like your dad is not perfect, but he surely didn't deserve that.  As a father, that would feel pretty terrible.  Apologize to him but also give the situation some time and space to breathe.  Maybe wait a day or two to allow everyone to cool off.
Yep.  you can contact the lieutenant governer and governer general over this.
Judge by the content of their character. They are hilarious!

Dawn was the best season in my opinion because the Sundial was a better seasonal activity than Vex Off, Contact and Seraph Towers. The story was not the greatest compared to Arrivals but still great with the Saint-14 storyline. Loot was cool and the obelisks were a little plus in the season. Corridors of Time, Empyreean Foundation and the Dawning helped with the content. It was also before Covid-19 so life was kinda better.
Yeah it seems immature, but the Democrats started it.  The reason the left has gotten such a foothold, despite their many many failings, is because in general they lie and scream and cheat and riot, and the right, in general, doesn't.  I'm not saying the right should lie and cheat and riot like the left (absolutely not), but screaming to make sure their voices are heard? Definitely.
Can you mold a plastic insert so that you can lock the board into it, thus locking components into place?  I've always thought they should have done that with Seasons.
Yeah that's totally fair, I'm just a big fan of a well considered track listing that flows perfectly. Which is honestly probably one of the hardest things to do when making an album.  Out of curiosity, what tracks did you have on your 1 disc Blinking Lights playlist?
Nothing is stopping you whatsoever.  Always apply as PhD. That way you get paid to go instead of having to pay to go. It's just harder to get in.

The process did come to fruition hinkie just didn't get to do the final steps and colangelo and brand botched it. It was simple tho, tank and stockpile assets. Find two superstars like simmons and embiid and then trade assets for support to win while on their rookie deals. Sixers did exactly that, just Tobias Harris and horford were not the right pieces and jimmy Butler left them.   We actually don't know whether hinkie would've pulled it off any better. He was good at acquiring assets but what he did really didn't require any scouting skills or basketball knowledge. His draft record was actually pretty bad but that was the whole point of the process to give you more chances.   So while hinkie should've gotten the chance to finish it we have no idea if he would've done any better tbh. He never proved he could put together a winning team. Its a lot easier to trade everyone and suck for 3 years then it is to put pieces together for a championship squad.

Then I wonder why Scarfdona knows so much about how to get to the tower. She remembers nothing else, but her name and this. Also the part about Subaru and Emilia wondering about the trials feeling similar. Can the trials be Flugels creation and Echidna have no hand in it at all? Echidna being so smart and being the type of character who would experiment with these sorts of things I really doubt that.  Also this might be about the great library and not the tower itself.

No it's called being in denial. Not everyone's going to coddle your delirium.   You should be aware that you are not biologically a male if you have a period.  No one should be expected to entertain your mental illness and that doesn't make anyone a transphobe.

Think it depends on the industry. Mid size tech (less than 300, more than 200 employees) I work at just went indefinite work from home, with it being permanent for anyone that want's it.

Most of us had been working off site for the last 7 months without any decline or issue.  Having said that, the tech industry was already shifting towards remote working before COVID, COVID just seemed to solidified it in a number of companies.

Anecdote: a few years ago some friends on mine (mid-to-late 30s) were looking to buy a modest condo. They had been renovated twice in two years and wanted some stability. Every condo in their price range, they were outbid by someone fresh out of university. In one case, the buyer was reluctant to take the bid because they thought it was way more than the condo was worth and didn't think the bank would approve the loan. The parent stepped in to say don't worry, "if the bank won't approve it, we'll cover the difference".    Non-anecdote: intergenerational wealth plays a big role in growing inequality and reinforces existing inequality along racial or other lines.

I think you might be projecting (with the racist talk). Why have you determined "white people are superior"? This evaluation of the situation seems very problematic.  In my view of the world, each human is a unique entity. We can group people into groups along any arbitrary traits. Some groupings will have greater variance in outcome than others. But there are only 7.8 billion people and any grouping will be granular.   Eg. If you choose to group people be height you find that outcomes are heavily weighted in favour of those over 6 feet (but not too tall) when compared to people under 6 feet tall.   Reducing this example to "You're either believe this discrepancy is systemic or you're a Height-Traitor Height Supremacist" is creating a false dichotomy.

Yes, it is ridiculous, but that‚Äôs our country üôÑ. When you use your sick days, you should have heath insurance because you will be getting full pay. FMLA does not guarantee any pay or benefits, just that your job is protected for the 3 months after birth.  The NJFLI provides money for family leave, but no benefits. But I think most districts (mine included) do cover health benefits during the time taken for FMLA. Some districts require that you pay your contribution, but mine did not. So it can vary...my district actually had us meet with the board secretaries who explained everything. That made it easier to understand and talking to my colleagues who also had babies recently helped a lot too.   I had my daughter in December, so I started my maternity leave in November, had FMLA run from Jan through April, and then took an unpaid child rearing leave of absence for May and June. We switched to my husbands health insurance for May through August since I wanted to avoid paying COBRA. All in all the time was totally worth it, despite the headache of figuring it all out.

Learning how to practice effectively is  difficult and you also have to keep your mental and motivation in check while you are grinding - I  think that these skills are heavily influenced by your personality and education.  And even if you manage to do all these things right I still think that without talent you will never be the best player in the world - the opposite is also true though.

YTA  You're not the the asshole, you're an incredibly sexist one to boot.   Your wife has a "real job". She does work that she is formally compensated for.   Besides, if "being a Mom" is her job now, then considering she spent her entire fucking day doing that job already and was now busy doing her *second job*, shouldn't you have been the one to do the parent stuff at that moment?? Do you seriously expect her to take on all the parent responsibilities 24/7?? That is insane!   Also, it's incredibly disrespectful to tell your wife you don't consider the work she does valid. What the actual fuck, man? If you honestly feel that way, you should never have married her or had a kid with her. She deserves a partner who values and respects her.
Wow! That really ended up nice. I‚Äôve just been using Linseed oil. Maybe I should try lacquer. I really do use 2000 grit though. 120 then 200 then 400 then 600 then 1000 then 2000. My arms and back hurt constantly.

If you think about it, that isn't all that far from the truth because it isn't quite as common for a nation to write and popularize songs about a war they lost (especially not their national anthem). Not saying it's the case here, but it makes a fair amount of sense.

Thank you for your kind words, and for sharing your story. I'm so sorry you and your fur baby had to go through that, that's such a hard decision to make.   My moonmoon was completely healthy and just shy of his 5th birthday. We got him when he was 6 weeks old, for my sons 8th Birthday. Monday night he got something lodged in his throat.. it felt like a U shaped metal wire that was stuck down his throat and lodged up inside the roof of his mouth. It wouldn't fucking budge and I couldn't get it out in time to save him. He passed away right in front of our eyes, it was so sudden and beyond devastating.   Regardless of the circumstances, It's all devastating and just never feels fair.
As you gain experience and things slow down for you in the pattern you'll be able to have a good look as you arrive to a new airport and identify possible off field landing options.  But as with most things with flying it just depends.  Every takeoff has a different set of variables, so brief as well as you can, and then trust that your training will take over.
The problem is that the only ones who could change the system are the ones currently in charge, so the ones who are profiting from the system, thus change is simply not going to happen.  And yeah its amazing, biden for instance is against some stuff that even the rightest of the right here don't really want to get rid off (stuff like a proper healthcare system)

It all depends, really whatever you can use to keep you going. Be t anything anyone else has mentioned, such as this is the perfect time, to tire in a DBZ time chamber, to making a plan, or using this as time to try and better yourself, etc.   Find what will truly push you, anger, fear, hopelessness, being hopeful and positive, being a man, or woman of pure will, finding motivation through the positivity of this and other helpful online communities, sheer determination and discipline.   Use anything, and everything you can. Renaissance periodization has a somewhat recent video on training motivation, and how it‚Äôs not just about being motivated, and it‚Äôs not just discipline, it‚Äôs multi faceted, and your best chance at staying on track and staying as consistent as possible is to use everything at your disposal and be aware of all aspects to keep pushing.   It might sound silly, but if I am having really low motivation I do a few things.   1. Putting in some effort, even if I know it‚Äôs a crappy session is good for me, because I stay consistent and don‚Äôt break the good habit I‚Äôve formed.   2. I think of specific movie moments or documentaries that help motivate me, e.g. Apollo telling Rocky in Rocky III that ‚Äúthere is no tomorrow.‚Äù If you keep putting things off until ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, you‚Äôll lose years before you know it.   I also like in Westside Versus The World doc, Louie Simmons literally comes out of he hospital after a major surgery and has a hole in his throat, and goes and maxes out. This is obviously extreme and there should be a balance, but Dave Tate talks about it, and it made him realize, there‚Äôs never an excuse good enough to NOT train. I just tell myself, no matter what, no matter how tired I‚Äôm feeling, or lazy, or unmotivated, no matter what I am going to train. Because I know in the long run, it‚Äôs paying off.   3. Finally, I look at logs and see how much progress I‚Äôve made. And think about moments in my day to day life where things are easier because I‚Äôm at stronger, and in better shape.   Find whatever motivates you, and know that at times it‚Äôs hard for any one of us. But discipline, and determination help you keep pushing through the hard times. Anyone can train when they feel good. Not everyone when can when they don‚Äôt.   You can do it, it might take a huge push for now, but after enough time a good habit will form, maybe 5-12 weeks, and you won‚Äôt even think about it, for the most part you‚Äôll just do it.   You got this.

To make more sauce with less peppers you can make a thinner vinegar based sauce since your bottle does have a dropper top. I love carrot bassed sauces also and carrots are cheap, the amount of peppers depends on what kind of sauce you are making. Just as long as you ha e enough to get the heat level you need.

Ok, I know this will probably get buried, but I just have to say this. Froskyrinn is my favorite caster by far. This is for a couple of reasons.   Firstly, and this is the low hanging fruit, I think it's incredible that League has maintained a badass woman caster for several years. I know that this isn't exactly merit to her personal accomplishments but for esports (and just general sports) as a whole, she's been an absolute pioneer. Casting sports is an extremely male-dominant profession-- I'm thinking of the "boys clubs" that run American sports, or even global sports in general. I'm just really impressed with how Froskyrinn has been able to thrive in this scene, and never seem to be a "token woman" by having consistent valuable input to add. Part of why I've gotten more into League as an esport in recent years has been a direct result of her, and respect for Riot to back her up. It definitely offset some of my hesitancy resulting from League's notoriously toxic community.  Now this being said, I've not always appreciated Froskyrinn. About a year ago I got extremely fed up with her blatant unapologetic bias towards the LEC and G2 specifically. As a NA fan, with very little attachment to LEC teams, only ever really watching to keep up with global best teams (I really don't buy into the NA/EU allegiance as the "West"), I wanted a more objective take-- especially when G2 repeatedly underperform in the regular season. To my astonishment, though, Froskyrinn in this last year has shown what almost NO OTHER analysts or casters have: adaptability. I have routinely looked forward to her inputs because its clear to me that she has recognized her bias being a fault, and toned it back a lot. As of now, she gives extremely objective input with just the right amount of hype.  She was the one who predicted SUN to win, and say what you will, SUN had the harder bracket (decisively beating the tournament favorites TES), and showed greater draft flexibility. Nobody else had the stones to draw attention to that. Of course DWG won the tournament, but I think the series was much closer than most predicted.  Basically I hope Riot re-signs her, I think she has a lot more to offer as a caster.

Per US DOT sources "Each year, 24 percent of weather-related vehicle crashes occur on snowy, slushy or icy pavement and 15 percent happen during snowfall or sleet. Over 1,300 people are killed and more than 116,800 people are injured in vehicle crashes on snowy, slushy or icy pavement annually. Every year, nearly 900 people are killed and nearly 76,000 people are injured in vehicle crashes during snowfall or sleet." Unless fatal car crashes in snowy conditions increase to 220k this year I don't feel that this claim holds water  [SOURCE DOT](https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/weather_events/snow_ice.htm#:~:text=Over%201%2C300%20people%20are%20killed,crashes%20during%20snowfall%20or%20sleet.)

And by the way what the heck does Trump have to do with George Floyd? That cop will almost certainly be found guilty of a crime and receive a prison sentence. White people can killed by cops too and nobody says a thing. Point is, there will always be some bad cops who use their position in a negative way. All we can do is train cops to deescalate which Trump has already asked for nationwide. I heard him say it with my own ears.

I didn‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs the same thing. I said we have to deal with it as well.  We can‚Äôt just let people live with the destructive consequences of our actions to deal with CoVid.  For instance, the elimination of hospitals doing things like cancer screenings has meant that people have had to live with having cancer. It‚Äôs also eliminated other testing and assistance for other health conditions.  So in trying to save people from CoVid, we‚Äôre causing people to suffer from ailments that could kill them and we could be preventing just as much as CoVid.  You also have to consider that suicides have increased as a result of the mental health issues created by CoVid. These are preventable deaths which we‚Äôve let happen.  So why are those lives not important but the people who get CoVid are?  Mental health is important to help the issues created by our desire to deal with CoVid.

A couple other cases I know of. In 2008 Aeroflot flight 821 crashed after the drunk captain lost control of the plane, all 88 people on board died. And somewhat similar, in 1988 a US commuter plane crashed in Colorado killing 9 because the captain was going through withdrawal after staying up the previous night doing cocaine.  There are probably a few others but those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.

How do you guys balance a FIRE mindset but allowing splurges? Im only 21 in my senior year of college (at home for now) and I avoided some experiences like study abroad, maybe going out more, etc cause I felt guilty about spending money. To be fair, my parents are paying for my school which is why it feels wrong, but I have also accumulated about 30k in investments so far, should be closer to 45k when I graduate. My reasons for fire are around financial stability and supporting my parents towards them being able to retire. I had initially planned to be a bit more relaxed financially senior year after making a good amount from my summer internship and enjoy, but now COVID of course has altered that. Whether it be just going out more senior year or traveling post graduation before starting full time, looks like those plans wont go through now. So I finally have some money at least relative for my age and a good job lined up, but cant really even enjoy senior year the way I had hoped to. Just wondering if this has happened to other people on a larger scale with pursuing fire and maybe having regrets about how aggressively you pursued it. For what its worth, I do realize having a job lined up and money saved is a lot more privileged than many people right now at least.

Ok first of all pokemon and origami king are both single player, however with mario kart is for 4 I recommend buying another pair of joycons and if your still need one the pro controller its super comfy and great for almost any game on switch.

Soccer is also an abbreviation of Association (Soc) plus the suffix -er. And the term originated in England.   So everyone can fuck right off if they have a problem with the word soccer.
When you question how to 'judge' Islam, what do you actually mean? Because of course it makes no sense to treat all of Islam as a monolithic x, because Islam is applied by every Muslim in the world differently. People look at their own faith in unique ways, and when one seeks to find a single, straightforward, truth, the lived experience and worldviews of people, and the complexity behind such positions, is often ignored and disregarded.
Thank you

People seem to really like peddling these theories about game prep and ‚Äúhiding‚Äù stuff‚Äîin reality this doesn‚Äôt happen often. You are best at the stuff you do the most. There is very little logic to ‚Äúhiding‚Äù anything except a handful of tricks or gimmicks.  I mean MSU‚Äôs whole game plan was to exploit Michigan‚Äôs weakest position group by chucking up bombs. It worked well. But it‚Äôs not something you need to ‚Äúhide‚Äù. The reality is you lose most games you turn the ball over 7 times.

This is true. Accountants often have professional designations that are stated on their CVs (CPA). His does not have any, nor does he have any accounting education or experience on his CV. He was also an "Assistant Tour Coordinator" before the company merged with his current employer, so it seems like a weird shift to suddenly being an Accountant. Deavan is lying to make him seem more functional than he is.  Judging by his CV, he is a wayward 20-something who has taken a low-level job to pay his bills while he works on his creative projects. My guess is that he's doing something like data entry or clerk-type work.

My sister-in-law used to do the thing where she put her kids to bed the second they got off the bus. I didn't know about it and I was using her as a babysitter for mine, he tells me one day they get off the bus and are shut up in the room right away until dinner time at 7:00. It was hard financially and emotionally to take him away from his cousins, but I couldn't be dealing with that nonsense. I never found out what her problem was she's stay at home she had all freaking day with no kids around I guess it wasn't enough. Maybe she should get her tubes tied.

[This](https://i.postimg.cc/mrHL5DzN/Capture-2020-10-31-20-50-06.png) is what I came up with to meet the $65 (before tax and shipping) budget.  The hooker set contains all the sparrows basic hooks in 0.025", with handles.  The other sets don't have handles which might be okay, but might turn him off if it's uncomfortable.  The heavy bars fit the keyway of the sparrows locks best (I think - mine are on the way but the thickest of the flat 5 is a bit sloppy in my cutaway).  Revolver is slightly cheaper than cutaway + reload kit with tweezers.  I would only go with this if you think he'll be able to figure things out without a cutaway.  The other upside to the revolver is he doesn't have to do any repinning to get into the security pins.  Depends on whether you think he'd mind doing the tinkery work of gutting and repinning.  No case is included but you can get the tuxedo case for $8.  Sorry to give even more options.  Hope this helps :)
This review is spot-on.   a) I love James, I think I‚Äôm a lot less critical of him personally than a lot of people on this sub.  b) I have watched every single episode of AVGN and I still enjoy them to some extent, just less than I used to.  c) mike has always given me the creeps  d) I‚Äôve never finished the AVGN movie. I just can‚Äôt.  e) nobody that had never heard of AVGN was going to get into the web series from hearing about the movie. For that reason, the movie shouldn‚Äôt have been anything more than a really big budget version of what an episode of AVGN is like.  f) I still like James and I still get happy when he makes content.
He was chosen to bring the relics to summon the gods, that's his task. When he chooses to do is up to him, but uniting humanity is not a condition for his release. Otherwise, why would the GoL give two possible outcomes? If his task is to unite and only then he'll be free, then what's the deal with relics, summoning, and possible extinction of humanity?

I could see a Democratic Party that‚Äôs more fiscally progressive but also more socially conservative. Like, racial equality is certainly further along for obvious reasons.

That being said, MLK was also a devout Christian, and I don‚Äôt see things like LGBTQ+ rights being at the same level as OTL.

I haven‚Äôt ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety (by a professional, anyway) so I can‚Äôt allude to any experience or knowledge of either - I meant ‚Äòit gets better‚Äô as in general life.

You said you‚Äôre successful in video games - do you play multiplayer ones? Can you join societies or forums for it to look for other gamers who are near enough for you to meet up with? Keep searching and practicing until you start to find people you click with. If you have a rubbish conversation or think you said/did the wrong thing, it‚Äôs a lesson learned. Take it on board, and next time something like that comes up, you‚Äôll know to side-step it. Romantically... I can‚Äôt give you much advice on this as I‚Äôm extremely appalling and evasive when it comes to that side of socialising. I didn‚Äôt have a physical relationship with anyone until I was 25, and I completely recognise that feeling you describe of ‚ÄúBy next year, it will have happened‚Äù - what I do know is it tends to follow on from getting better at the socialising side of things.  As for the last point - stop worrying about being ‚Äúbehind‚Äù everyone else and focus on yourself. It‚Äôs your life - don‚Äôt let comparisons to others take up space in it. I know this is easier said than done, but try. It feels so much better and you get so much further
Of course, why didn't I think of that? Thanks mate!

I‚Äôm pretty confident that that won‚Äôt happen. At minimum Dems will likely reach the mark preventing that which is around 52.
&gt;And those leaders do not represent the opinion of their citizens? When Macron speaks on the matter he says what most people think here  Macron is a democratically chosen leader in a safe country that has the added bonus of being secular. Many countries that are not secular and have islam as a nations religion are in state of political unrest and face long term absence of democracy.  &gt;That‚Äôs the point of polls, it means something.  It doesn't. If I were to ask Shiite and Suni muslims if they condoned the attack, there wouldn't be a number that high. If I were to reach out to salafists, you'd get a number of 25% in youth groups yes. Besides that, polls always have the issue of bias, meaning that people who don't feel strongly about the attack wouldn't bother taking time to answer it. People who are constantly defending these attacks would gladly take the time to fill out a pol to make their voice heard. Also I think your figure is shit ans that you're either lying or misrepresenting data in order to spread hate.  Yes, less than a percent of muslims across the world support these attacks. Once again, I don't think you understand how many muslims this planet has, ans that everyone has their own morals regardless of religion.

Nice work
Yes, but Bey also expands Blackness into more than just "Black people;" Blackness as "being black" in many different meanings.  From the intro:  I am thus designating Black anarchism's anarcho-Blackness as a Black feminist critique and taking up of anarchism, asserting that 1) the "Black" in front of anarchism is to be understood not as a "mere" marker of identity but as a political and capaciously politicized affixation.  It designates more of a mode and position of reading, engaging, and undermining the tenets upon which hegemonic sociality rests.  Etc.

I really like MMORPG‚Äôs.  I was never a fan of PvP until I started learning how to heal for them.  I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so fun to keep people from dying..  but sometimes when I keep myself or others alive against rogue-types or whatever, I like to imagine how angry sweaty little basement-dwellers are getting bc their dps against my hps ain‚Äôt shit.  (most times, however, the opposing team marks me pretty quick and I can‚Äôt heal much for others.  When that happens I try to grab as many of the opposing team I can and stay alive as long as possible to distract while my teammates capture the flag or node or whatever)  I only like first person shooters or RPG‚Äôs for their story..  Like, I only played COD for the campaign.  especially if there are multiple endings or dialogue options (like KOTOR, The ME Trilogy especially).  Those are almost like a different game every time.

He's not.  He tried to work with the Democratic party to get some shit passed, they declined.  So he said he'd work with either party to get it done.  trump is desperate for PR, so they worked with Ice Cube.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfxzMSK5PBk  That's a recent Trevor Noah interview where they go over it, skip to 5:20 to hear him talk about it.  But honestly, you should listen to the whole thing since they spend the time talking about *what* Ice Cube was really doing.

Not really. It's the norm.
I personally like using frame foundations placed within cliffsides and rock outcroppings to give areas a "still natural, but being worked" feeling, like scaffolding or rockslide barricades. It also helps keep a grid even when working in rough terrain, to help visualize how much space there is to build with. Blending foundation into terrain can make mining outposts look amazing, if you're like me and need to place foundation everywhere. Try putting quarter-pipes halfway into the ground surrounding your miners, that also looks really cool. Walkways go well with it, too.

It's not GOT7 who needs a reboot, but rather JYPE. Just because JYP is no longer the CEO, doesn't mean he doesn't have the control over the creative process. GOT7 gets creative control over their songs, sure, but they don't get to decide over their title track. And that's a big problem here.

The blue bucket for kids with autism is presumably to inform adults that these kids may be non-verbal. I believe the performing she is referring to is the idea that adults expect kids to say ‚Äútrick or treat‚Äù.  It sounds she is fed up with the idea that kids with autism have to carry around a special symbol so they can be excused from the ritual. I agree with her I think it‚Äôs unnecessary othering for those kids when it would be easier to just give the kids the fucking candy and not give a shit if they don‚Äôt say the magic words.   Not a Karen.

I used to cut a lot for basically any emotion and even if I felt it was normal and fine it was still unhealthy. You gotta find a way to displace the feeling of cutting or avoid triggering the desire to do so.

Due to the divergence of white voters based on education, you have to know the education level of your respondents and weigh that based on the statistics state wide. College educated whites are more likely to vote democratic, while non-college educated whites vote more republican. By splitting this group to control for overall trends, you get a more accurate picture. In 2016, whites were treated as a monolith, which doesn‚Äôt work when they are 65-70% of the turnout and have a major discrepancy in voting trends based on educational attainment.

The sad part is this was Gurley's specialty! Dude has successfully done  the 1st down/fall short of TD on purpose play many times before. Every time the announcers are like, "Yeah this is why Gurley is a great back to have. There are a lot of players who would absolutely refuse to do this because they want to pad their stats with the TD. You can tell Gurley sees the big picture."  Obviously he didn't mean to score but I was shocked when he did, as he has run that play many times.

Apples and oranges.  The 15 minute tests are antigen.  And usually are good at saying you are negative, but not as good at saying you are positive.  Usually they are confirmed with a PCR test if they show positive to make sure it really is positive. Gets confusing because you have PCR, antigen, and antibody that all have different characteristics.
It is easy to lose my interest when they add religion to things.

Hi Samuel! I really enjoyed seeing this AMA and I know that it's technically over but I have a few questions I wanted to ask if you don't mind answering  1) I'm an American with Pakistani origin, and I have a lot of friends from different backgrounds, and one thing I've found is that a lot of cultures share is the concept of "the evil eye." I don't know about the specifics of other cultures but in Pakistani culture, the evil eye is basically something that happens when someone compliments you with hints of jealousy. The person then begins to have random small bad things happen to them, and the "purification" process is different from region to region, with some places having simple prayers and others having a whole ritual. What is it about the evil eye that's persists in many different cultures and why doesn't western culture have anything like this sort of thing in its list of old superstitions? (Or does it and I'm not aware?)  2) why is Alchemy treated like some sort of magic potion making art in western culture? Alchemy as far as I know is just Arabic for chemistry. Was Alchemy seen as mystic potion making early in its time?  3) the concept of a spell needing to be said out loud by the magic user is something many cultures share, but having "magic artifacts" like wands, staffs, etc is something I've only seen in western magic stories. Is magic weaponry something that only originates in western culture?
Modern US TV and film almost never touches on how the majority of Americans live.  &amp;#x200B;  Most Americans don't live in comfortable, clean suburban homes (even if you actually live in a suburb chances are your house isn't that great. ASK ME HOW I KNOW.). Most aren't pampered Jersey Shore douchebags. Most don't live in major cities. Most black people in the US aren't hip-hop listening urbanites. Most people will never go to college at all, and plenty will only go to a community college that will still contrive to fleece them for money. All those ubiquitous medical dramas? Yeah, like 90% of the patients in those shows will have to file for bankruptcy after the episode ends (hey, House, all those bullshit tests and treatments you ordered caused the patient's insurance to hit its cap and now they're personally in debt for $200,000, like 30k of which will end up in Cuddy's bank account).  &amp;#x200B;  The closest shows to real America are *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul,* where the start of the plot is a guy needing cash to pay for his cancer treatment and where even at its peak the meth empire is only dealing in tens of millions of dollars. The stakes always stay pretty petty in the grand scheme of things. It's a world where scrapping together a few hundred thousand to pay the secret forger guy who works out of a vacuum repair shop is a major obstacle.  &amp;#x200B;  There's also stuff like *Treme* (before David Simon lost his mind), and *99 Homes*, the only legitimately good and truthful film made about the 2008 crisis.  &amp;#x200B;  I think one of the reasons Spider-Man remains an ever popular character is because he's never stopped being a kind of everyman, perpetually in need of money.
No, it would be worse than current media. Current media, because it is privately owned, can make it's own choices about what it puts on it's platform.
