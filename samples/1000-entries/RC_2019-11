As a Pichu main, Pichu is one of the worst characters you can pick in a free-for-all imo.  1. Damages itself with electric attacks, making you easier to KO 2. Lightest character in the game, you're gonna die easily 3. You're probably gonna mess up his recovery somehow or get hard punished  You should go with the heavies ( Personally I pick Dedede and DK) because they live long and kill early.  ~~HERO IS THE BEST~~

i think the overall finish of it looks really good.  My only suggestion would be to be mindful of leading lines and tangents in the composition stage.  You have two horizontal lines that cut the image in half vertically with only a single element that breaks that line. At first glance it looked like two separate images side by side.

It's $6k today and allegedly $7k starting tomorrow -- I keep telling myself that if the updates are worth it I'll be willing to spend $7k on it.   I wasn't willing to drop the $6k on it because AP does the vast majority and it's not legal for self-driving anyway and likely won't be until I upgrade cars in a few years.
This is a really well thought out approach and follows the intent of the policy.

&gt; Right, but even if they have high inequality the poor in the Nordic system still have access to health care, still get free higher education, still get guaranteed paid time off for paternity and sick/vacation.  [So did Americans at one time or at least reasonably inexpensive and then the fire nation attacked.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK0KOimnZu0) The issue isn't what happenstance and situation has merely flung upon a country, but that in the fact that capitalism is not a system of intrinsic prosperity. It's as much a system of speed and oppression. And for some countries, speed is what is necessary to survive. Capitalism is in essence akin to an arms-race itself. The goal of an arms race isn't to produce anything of value so much as defend itself from external forces. Amongst international capitalism, every state is as at once both cooperative and competitive, finding advantage and exploitation where it can and producing benefit where it must to acquire that situation of exploitation. In this case, the Nordic system is in the cycle where it's producing a benefit to it's own people and it's seemingly on the cusp of turning that benefit into exploitation again. It's a cycle that's seen in every capitalist country and capitalists play shell games with wealth and labor amongst the intra-communities and then globally in the inter-communities.

I only know 2 other people in real life who use it and both of them are fluent English speakers; one of them worked in the U.S. Since this site is dominated by users from the U.S.,  I think the usual characteristics of someone from Latam who use reddit are:  1. Have a certain connection with the U.S. 2. Can read English. 3. Understand U.S. internet humour  Yahoo and Taringa were the 2 most famous forum-based sites people used, but this was quite some time ago.

Get out of my head, haha!   But what if when I did it before, I had a health coach holding me accountable? Now I’m just alone with nobody to make sure I do right.
But his legal opinion has no bearing on if it is actually illegal. Even if he's the worst human on the planet his self preservation instincts might make him the guy for the job.  (I don't know that he is the worst person. I was being demonstrative.)
I didn't reply to this earlier because it would have prolonged this thread beyond where I wanted to leave it, but one thing I do want to post a retort for:  &gt;I can show you why I'm fairly convinced he had a hand in making really dirty against a vulnerable opponent  Due to the nature of twitter, almost every candidate could be subjected to that, however, Charles Kennedy being vulnerable is not an excuse. You cannot and I hope are not saying that they shouldn't have politically engaged in unseating him purely because of his personal troubles.  Whilst I agree that personal attacks don't serve debate much (its why I am vehemently in favour of Rule 4), sometimes it's simply unavoidable in an objective sense, even if the initial reaction is subjective.  Imagine for example that you and I are at a hustings on opposite sides of the aisle (not a long shot I'm sure you'll agree).  I stand up and say (without aiming it him personally, only the panel), "I don't feel that someone dealing with a serious, personal, physical and mental condition, can objectively and effectively, fulfil their role as a public servant. It is in fact a disservice to themselves and to the public, because as long as they must focus their full attention on getting better, that is mutually exclusive with serving the public to their best extent."  That is as nice as I can phrase it. There was a news article recently about an MP who got stick on Twitter for his spelling and grammar in tweets and he revealed that he's dyslexic. No shade here, glad I know so I can modify my attitude when reading their feed.  Can you honestly tell me that you wouldn't hold a personal issue against an MP who you're politically against, if you felt that it impacted them in their capacity as an MP? For example, if an MP had anorexia and was frequently impacted by therapy or hospital appointments.  I would not judge you for commenting on that personal situation when it came to replacing them, because it would ultimately be better for the people they represent. Because they'd represent the people who support them AND those that don't.   But for people who are always in the public eye and always ultimately accountable to the people who elect them, ignoring their personal life when it impacts their professional is intellectually dishonest.  Look at Tim Farron for example, and the stooshie around him.  Sorry for the wall of text mate, I'm working from home tomorrow so can afford a later bedtime.

I smiled at this
Smile more than you thing. Talk in an upbeat voice. Repeat orders back to them.   Be super nice to the cooks and bartenders. And too them out accordingly. They control when your stuff gets made. And chefs will be nicer to you, when you out an order in wrong (it's gonna happen), and fix it faster.   Managers are there to help you. If anyone complains about something you can't control apologize, and if they seem upset ask if they want to talk to a manager. ( I ask almost Everytime because I am too busy to stand there while they slowly make a complaint taking forever to get to the point)   Be transparent. I work on campus at a buffalo wild wings. So on game days our ticket times can run 2 hours. I tell them this before they order so they know if they want to wait that long and don't get mad later. If your busy let them know the kitchen is backed up.  If you are waiting on the bartender to change a keg for a beer, let them know and ask if they want a water while waiting. Sometimes bartenders can get backed up and end up putting it off for 10 minutes or so.  If you get double or triple sat. Take everyone's drink orders at once. When dropping them off, say "I'll be back in just a minute to take your order" drop off all drinks. Then take all tables orders and put them in the computer at the same time. This prevents people from sitting to long without being greeted or getting their drinks. And it's much faster to take all orders and then put them in, than running back and forth. Also sometimes you have to wait for another person to finish putting in orders for their tables.  Overall try to be quick. But if it takes a few minutes people will generally understand.  Also tell people you are new. They will generally go easier on you and not be so quick to complain.

I found that if I let the “breakdown” time run it’s course I come out of it ready and focused to take on anything. But even when you are low it helps to have something to work on to keep your mind busy; Art is my go to, or learning new instruments.  Essentially just treat yourself as a god would during a slump.

As the other guy said, inequality is getting worse. More and more wealth is being transferred from the poor end of society and concentrated in the hands of the few super rich. Wealth is at its most unequal distribution for decades. Every occasion in the past has seen massive redistribution of wealth to the masses due to events: world war two saw the biggest wealth distribution ever. The way to achieve such redistribution without such a tumultous event is through fair and considered taxation. Because at the moment, our rate of wealth transfer is unsustainable, and you can already see the problems it is leading to with the housing crisis for younger people.

One of my former best friends started dating a 14 year old when he was 19, and cut ties with me and another friend when we called him out on it. He is a reckless driver (on his fourth car already after 3 years of driving) who doesn't listen when you tell him to slow down, and he's obviously dating someone underage. I don't know how "involved" they are, and I don't know why her parents are okay with it since he apparently lives with them (his father, mother and step mother all kicked him out). As far as I'm aware, he's waiting until she's legal before he gets "serious" with her, but as long as she's consenting to the relationship and he knows the danger he's putting himself in, I'm not getting involved.   I won't report him to the police because he's a former friend and I believe the whole reason he's doing this is due to the rough childhood he had. However, if he's found out and arrested then I have no quarrels with it. I just hope for his sake that he realises what he's doing is wrong, and that he bails out without consequences (because of course if it's a tough breakup then she could ruin him and send him to prison).

Notice how we had “good news” in 2018 - BYD, DNV GL signing ceremony with Kings, in 2019 Walmart, and the price kept dropping on every bit of news.

It’s also pretty misogynistic. There’s no male version of Karen despite the fact that, in my experience (12 years in customer service), middle aged men are more likely to be aggressive and abusive when something is wrong with their order/product. Which is surely worse than the annoying/entitled “Karen”
Niners haven’t given up a passing TD in 4-5 games, but you know they’re going to target Kirk a lot. Niners offense is pretty fickle on who they target week to week but my guess is Kittle is the one who’s going to get the targets this week, I still see Sanders getting 4-5 for about 50 yards, maybe a TD   TY has the biggest upside but if he’s hurt you’re fucked, I’d probably go with Sanders

It is a pavlonian reflex, which is why I'm surprised you're reading so far into it. It's just what their culture does, like how we swear or say "Jesus Christ." I personally say that all the time, to things shocking and things benign, despite having no faith in that regard.  Also, haven't we been shown to worship anything? Is that really an unrealistic fear born out of insecurity? We have the exact same warning in both the old and new testements. It's also one of the main criticisms of Catholicism (from a religious perspective..)

AU means 'alternative universe', which is basically a universe that is slightly or completely different than the canon one. It can be different from the original as the base of it, or with events that have occured...  Semi literate refers to the level of detail you add to your writing. It's the middle level, and can be from, about 3+ lines, to a few paragraphes.  And no, I haven't heard of it before. Though, I just searched it, and as far as I understood, it's an rpg forum, not a roleplay forum, right?

Honestly I think therapy might be really important for answering those questions. Figuring out what that hole is, and filling it yourself - and cutting out anyone who doesn't treat you the way you want to be treated - is super important. Being alone can be scary, but with some healing it can also be amazing. Learning to be alone, single, was part of my journey, and I started loving it. and loving myself. I can make decisions in my relationships now knowing that if it isn't right for me, I can leave and will be fine - even happy! Alone can be a hell of a lot better than in a toxic dynamic...and lets you re-approach relationships and others from a place of health, strength, and recovery.

Good lord, someone is using their child to make videos called “mini-AOC” with this little girl reading some scripted anti-socialist nonsense. That’s gross.
Not home ownership in particular, but there are plenty who are in favor of the "I am entitled to your money" paradigm.
That probably changes a lot though.

Agreed. What. A shitshow.
Rome had very few prenomina (first names) with only about twenty in common use.  Quintus was not reserved for the fifth child, and often first children were named this.  It was almost as common as Marcus.  Could sometimes have referred to the birth month or just be a kid named after his father. Richer girls tended to be given a feminine version of the family name, like Julia for the Julii, but if there was more than one, could be numbered.

I’m 19, vape here and there and tried nicotine gum a few weeks ago and truly thought I needed to go to the hospital 15 minutes into chewing it.  I got pale, cold, and felt like I was going to fall over. I started throwing up and dripping sweat (while still freezing cold). After throwing up for a few minutes I got extremely tired and dizzy and light started feeling extremely bright.   After about 20 minutes of that my body temperature got a little better but for the rest of the day I was sweaty, slightly dizzy, and fatigued.
Dope thanks man I appreciate you bro

1) Traphouse Druglord on Google Play. It's a Drug dealing simulator.   2) Middle Earth Shadow of War. I like the Nemesis system cause it adds replayability and the multiplayer is fun as well. Building up an army to siege the fortress is great and it's always a different type of challenge.

That's not a valid statement. A girls a girl. A boys a boy.
Yeah. For years i wanted to deny it but in the end i couldn't maintain the double think that it takes to see one thing and believe another.

The Bearcats shoot 60% from the field, including 8-for-16 beyond the arc.  McNeal is your leading scorer with 15. Jaevin chipped in 13 on 3-for-3 from deep. Jarron added 10 with 4 steals.  Cincinnati had a 21-0 fast break advantage, 50 points in the paint, and 15 steals. -@GoBearcatsMBB

My friend and I bought a fire TV stick 4k on the same week.  He is wireless but I use a wired adapter.  Same model and software version.  He has a Ryzen 2600 and a Geforce 770, and I have a Ryzen 3600 with a Geforce 2060.  We have the free Windows Plex server (no plex pass), and yet on his rig the exact same x265 video plays slow and has to transcribe, but mine does direct play.  To the best of my knowledge, free Plex does not allow hardware transcoding.  We have duplicated each other's settings on both the server and on the fire tv stick.  We can't figure out why mine does better.

&gt; When did I say that?  &gt; You do realize you're trying to explain what BH stigma is to an Army psychologist?  The answer to both of these was your own original fist question.  I agree that odds are for it to destroy your career are largely from toxic leaders.  Words have meaning.  I’m just trying to be clear to the masses that yeah there’s still a chance it can mess things up.  While you may know and understand the various implications, Im the guy sitting behind the commander and listening to him make decisions.  Flight crew wasn’t even on my think about list in that scenario funnily enough.  Bottom line is Know yourself, know your command, and get the help you need.
Is she adorable? Absolutely! Did the child actually request to dress up as a supreme court justice? I'd wager no. I think the main takeaway from all the criticism is just let kids be kids. We don't need to inject politics into every aspect of life. Happy Halloween!
How can’t I...  All I have... are negative thoughts..
I feel you put too much into the graphics and not enough into content (though the content you do have is quite good). For an entry level position one page is ideal. I feel you could get this content into one page pretty easily.  Your side graphics are kinda cool but the metric is arbitrary and they might give you harder questions since you claimed to know something in and out that it turns out you know know a college level of. The reason i didn't continue after my masters is i realized i was learning way more working than i was in school and getting paid for it vs paying. Most companies don't expect a lot out of you out of college because they know you really only know the basics even if you feel like you know it all. I was interviewing with someone at Lockheed Martin that had put a rover on Mars and had been working for 30 years. If i said i knew C++ at a 4/5 level he would have laughed at me because a 4/5 for him would have put me at 15 years of work experience. But they didn't except me to because i was fresh out of school and are absolutely fine with that. Basically what i'm saying here is instead of saying you know know these things at various levels, you can condense that section to a small comma separated list of things you know without ratings and use the extra space to go over stuff you have done to demonstrate your skills vs rate them yourself. Then again if you don't need the space then it does look decent and makes yours pop vs others. Then again some engineering positions don't like the pop as they feel it is you trying to fill space or distract from not having other content. I have a two line section of mine that has a list of all languages and software i know or have used.  Another thing you should try and mention if there is room is demonstrating leadership and teamwork skills. That can be in projects or in clubs outside of school/work.  Classes are good to have on there especially ones related to the field you are applying for and particularly projects/group projects. I like to keep my resume to one page but my draft version is 1.5. When i'm applying i tailor it to the particular position. So i reword some sections to make it sound more appealing to the company/position. You can get keywords to add in off their recruiting page or application page if it's for that particular position. I also remove the less relevant stuff to make it one page.  Speaking of customization, you don't seem to have a mission statement or anything like that. You're going to want one.  I'm also lazy and didn't actually read it all so i don't have any comments on grammar or whatever. But i did like how you used action verbs and different ones for each bullet. Repetition is boring and whoever is reading this is also reading 20 others while also doing their actual job. Thus why keywords and stuff are important. That's also why many people like single page ones.  &amp;#x200B;  If you want any examples i have several versions of mine as well as a lot of friends from the same field. I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Feel free to DM me.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: your iOT one has some repeated stuff on the left side

Being colorblind doesn't change the fact that the sky is blue or the fact that a basketball is not a football.  You can claim your "opinion" all you want. All youre proving is that A) you don't know what they said and B) you don't actually want to admit that.  You're just trying to defend yourself under the notion of "It's my opinion on what they said!"  Its simply not true. Its a fact that the globetrotters weren't completely  hating on this kid, its your "opinion" that they said ANYTHING else.

I can definitely agree that RNG is the main enemy here.. Honestly, some kind of improvement to summons would only really be beneficial to KLab, not only would it make the despair arc lessen, but would increase spending because of the current state of the game. Less stressful to obtain dupes of new or favourites in the pool = potential spending to attempt getting them and multiple copies for Transcendence upgrades.   I do like the idea you proposed, as another game I play does something similar every weekend with a special banner.   It's rather frustrating really. I've had decent luck here on this banner, but other banners that caused me massive despair to the point where I thought I was the embodiment of back luck. I'll never forget the 7 month dry spell of only 1 new unit from banners as they came... I was almost gone from the game at that point.  My friend spent 1500 orbs on this banner and not even a dupe. TYBW also shafted him to oblivion. Only good thing was when we both bought the first Halloween ticket and both got Gin from it.
Pretty much all melee opponents can be immobilized (or made very slow) this way.  It was a classic tactic in Fallout 1 and 2 -- use your AP to strike the leg, then remaining AP to get out of reach. When it was the enemy turn, the crippled leg made walking toward you chew up all of their AP.   My Fallout 2 character won the martial arts championship by pretty much doing this constantly.

Depends on the guy's past. As I said, the more you practice something, the easier it comes. And people are differently gifted in different things. White knighting has no reason to be different.  There are also various psychological effects that make it so that in a crowd, responsibility is spread wider, so people are less inclined to act. So most people just stand by and very few actually do something.

So is there even like a Theory on it?
Bringing in subsidized contractors to manage properties won't necessarily make things better for renters. That would be an alternative model that keeps costs lower, but it's not a better alternative. Their rent will go down, but so will profit margins for the umbrella managing body which won't see the need to spend $ money improving the property and attracting renters when their profit margin is dictated by the comparitively rigid government subsidies rather than the free market. What this means is that contractors will essentially be focussed on the opposite of what Americans want, treating renters like cattle. The name of the game would become "how many people can we accomodate in this one block so that we can get the maximum subsidy possible for the land". I doubt many would willingly switch to that model. Renters certainly wouldn't want to.

&gt; I am very surprised by the amount of girls I know that don’t find ripped dudes attractive. They would rather have somebody who is healthy and just in good shape overall.  Most women have a very limited understanding of the male physique. Most of the time their idea of "ripped dudes" is juicy bodybuilders, and "in good shape overall" is the physique of a pro rugby player.

I'm simultaneously the more intellectual, and more wild one.   I don't hangout with my friends that often. I'll often hang maybe once a month or less at times. When I hangout and they ask what's up, how I've been, it's just same shit different day, you? Then we move on to bullshitting about new shows or movies we've watched. My friends don't share most of my same interests, or curiosity, so it's usually just the part of myself that overlaps with their interests that I express.  I'll make a lot of sarcastic or otherwise jokes, voices, point out stupidities I see in an amusing I can't believe how dumb this shit is kind of way.   Smoke a lot of weed while doing the above. In-between fucking around with jokes I'm often quiet. I'm the funny, smart asshole in the group basically. The resourceful one as well. Friend wants to build a pc, I help him pick out the parts and show him how easy it is to put it together, troubleshoot it and talk him off the ledge when it fails to post and ram needs to be rma'd.   In-between hanging out with my friends, we'll send links to Reddit posts or movie trailers and shit, but beyond that not much communication.  Most of my actual communication, intellectual or more interpersonal tends to be with female friends I've made online. I open up more when I've got at least some kind of flirty sexual dynamic with someone.

Hey, two nights ago I got raided by the pirates and by a freaking Derelict armada so I had no time to spare.   Last night things settled down and Derelict left after they purged every single colony I had... fun times for my colonist... (I used tactical retreat)   Tested last night Autonomy for 200 days and no, the planet will stay completly the same as you left it. Utterly useless. I got 0.1 trading bonus... so yea no point in that.   You have to develop the planet, give it defences and stuff then turn it to Autonomy. The planet was also all the time on -4.5 Growth but it did not destabilize. In the end, I just gave it to TT guys.

I quit going to my doctor. The meds I was prescribed didn't work so he'd switch me to others and it just kept getting worse. the side effects of the switching made me feel like I was going insane. I no longer felt like myself. Marijuana helps me nowadays and my main thing is doing art. I found a hobby I love and it relaxes me. I get to thinking to hard and that's when those thoughts hit. Like fuck, if I die then I don't gotta deal with all this bullshit. Then I get to doing some art and find my reason to live. Others find joy in my art and that brings me more joy that I'm creating something that's isn't worthless like I feel sometimes.

You can approximate that since the solution is very dilute, its density is the same as that of water. Then you use the formula c = d x, where d is the density, x is mass fraction and c is the mass concentration. Then all you need is to convert to mass to molar concentration.

Hi, sorry I ended up being late to this rewatch, I only just found out about it a few days ago and it wasn’t until now that I actually had the time to sit down and get caught up for the rewatch. This show is something that’s very special to me, and while this is the sort of thing I’d normally write for Episode 1, since I missed that particular boat you’ll have to put up with me gushing about it now, a solid quarter of the way into the series already. Just warning that this is like a full-essay-length ramble coming up, so sorry if this comes off as pretentious or whatever.   Hyouka came at just about the perfect time in my life for it. I watched it for the first time in the summer of 2018, and I had just wrapped up my last year of high school, ready to close the book on my high school life as a whole, and I think Hyouka is basically the perfect anime for that sort of contemplative, reflective mood. Lots of anime have this sort of romanticized view of high school life, and that’s still absolutely true of Hyouka, but for some reason this show perfectly captures what it feels like to look back on those days. I think there’s a lot of reasons for that, from the visuals, the soundtrack, to the characters and the writing. It’s all just so...peaceful. This was my first SoL anime that I ever watched, and boy was that a good decision. This show proved to me that you don’t need hype moments or a really intense overarching story for me to find it enthralling.   As a teenager I had a lot of times where my thought process went a lot like Oreki’s, and funnily enough the series of events that sets him on his path towards self-actualization has a lot of strange parallels to events in my own life, so I already was inclined to like him, but he’s just such a funny, relatable, and likeable guy that he eventually became one of my favorite characters ever, and this just improves as the series goes on. Really, the same could be said for all four of our main cast, half the fun of this series is watching these four lovable dorks bounce off each other, grow and develop for 20+ episodes. I’ll have a lot more to say about them all later on, especially towards the end, but for now it’s mostly other stuff I want to focus on.  I can’t see anything from this show without it instantly putting me in a better mood, and I think it has that effect on a lot of people. It’s relaxing while still having some really engaging storylines, it’s comedic but never gets exhausting or feels over-the-top, it can be dramatic without ever being a downer and certainly never exploitative. Somehow each of the little mysteries are fun despite the very worst acts being investigated are [mild spoiler warning](/s "petty theft, a bit of emotional manipulation, and pretty standard teen drama".) The stakes are always very low, but because I love the presentation and the characters so much it’s never boring.   I’m not very qualified to speak of the technical details because I’m not really that well-versed in the sort of techniques used, but this show is definitely the most consistently pretty TV anime I’ve seen in my (admittedly fairly limited) experience. The lighting and coloration work in particular is absolutely gorgeous, and I think I could frame almost any given still from this show and hang it on a wall somewhere. I’ve noticed a couple of cut corners on this rewatch, but they’re so few and far between it doesn’t matter. The show uses a lot of very bright, gentle colors and natural lighting to make everything feel just that much more real, welcoming and calming, and the classical-heavy soundtrack just adds to the laid-back feel. God, I love this show. It hurts knowing how many of the people responsible for this work of art got stolen from this world in the summer. Anyway, onto the episode at hand.

Would highly suggest mace if you’re using the BART daily. Especially if you ride past 4pm. No reason not to have a little extra deterrent.
Push them as high as they'll go and cheese it a little higher, if they don't hit 70k as a minimum, apply elsewhere. If they don't offer 80k+ considering your revenue % pulled in, I'd still job hunt. People want money, they'll pay for that service 110%.

Totally agree.  We are high salary (certainly top 5% US) and live in a high salary professional area.  A lot of us LOVE thrifting.  You do you.  I can't imagine why saying that would affect him in the work place at all if he dressing professionally and playing the part. If OP and BF got married and had kids, believe me, thrifting will look even better.   I'm gonna pop some tags ....
They make me feel a little better as well but it seems a little like Russian roulette. If you get a bad one and you lose two ds4s and 2 Moves, what’s the response? I’m hoping someone will reply as to how the RMA was handled.   I’d hate to shell out the money to replace all those controllers because of a $35 charger. Also, the company not responding is not a good sign.
You think the Marshall plan was all that happened? You think we just pumped money into Germany and that made them forget about Nazism? Your ignorance of denazification is simply awe inspiring. We occupied Germany for decades and forced Germans to feel shame for their actions. THAT is why Nazism has never come back in Germany.  Here is what *actually* caused Germans to desert Nazism:   We held the entire nation responsible for the crimes committed by the Third Reich, in order to instill a sense of Collective Responsibility, Collective Punishment, and Collective Guilt.  We forced Germans to tour concentration camps, exhume mass graves, and bury the bodies of slain Jews.  We barred any German with ties to the Nazi party from being allowed to hold any civil job.  We destroyed all traces of Nazism. We tore down their buildings, their art, and their statues.  We forced them to ban swastikas and hate speech.  We took control of German media by taking over 37 German newspapers, six radio stations, 314 theaters, 642 cinemas, 101 magazines, 237 book publishers, and 7,384 book dealers and printers.  We prohibited criticism of occupying allied forces and banned 30,000 books.  We tried their military and government leaders in public and executed and imprisoned them.  The Psychological Warfare Division of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force undertook a psychological propaganda campaign in order to develop a German sense of collective responsibility and guilt.  We forced German citizens to watch movies such as "Die Todesmühlen" and "Welt im Film No. 5" to show them the horrors of the concentration camps.  We published posters and pamphlets with pictures of dead bodies in concentration camps and plastered them all over German cities. These posters typically contained the words YOU ARE GUILTY OF THIS and THESE ATROCITIES ARE YOUR FAULT  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification
HELL TO THE NO. Good luck to you, holy shit.
Hey thanks for that reply!  I appreciated it. It’s great when there is real communication here. I wish I could figure out a way to help people wade through the people with zero training or experience.   Truly!  Absolutely there are people just wanting to make money.  I’m on fb groups that make me sick.  Greedy and unqualified.  And even more people who I think mean well, but are clueless. But even the “listings” and “referral services” seem to just be out to make a buck by charging or by making you complete “their programs.”   So they don’t really help.  I’m working on my website, but again, being able to make a good website doesn’t say anything about your coaching ability. Even testimonials don’t really matter. It’s impossible to know if they are real.   You didn’t ask .... but I have a bachelors and a Masters degree in special education. 23 years teaching experience, working with students who have mild disabilities. The majority of them with ADHD.  In my job I worked frequently and successfully with parents and teachers to help them understand and help their kiddos.  And often deal with their own struggles (ADHD being common in families, parents often were dealing with their own issues.  Parents often get diagnosed when their kids do.... it’s frequently what makes them see it in themselves.)   Then a year long supervised life coach training program.   But no programs are truly accredited.  So you basically have to take my word that it was a legitimate/ quality  program.  A week in California learning even more about Executive Function Skills.  A week in Colorado training to use drums/ rhythms to help with ADHD (and Alzheimer’s patients, and therapeutic groups). More short coaching programs than you can count.  A certification in instructional coaching so I can coach teachers to do a better job with ADHD students. Seeing a handful of clients in my new office for months. My 18’year old was diagnosed at age eight.   I was diagnosed in my late 40s.   But still there is no real way to communicate clearly that I am qualified.  And of course none of that actually guarantees anything.  I honestly hope that licensing becomes required. That would definitely help.  Sorry.  That was just me being frustrated, too!   Thanks for letting me vent.
Avoid clouds and any visible moisture.  Don't fly at night, you won't be able to see the precip.  Before you take off, take a quick look at the top of the airplane if there is any chance of frost or fallen precipitation.  Check the icing products and stay far away, laterally, from any SLD (supercooled liquid droplets). Even if you're out of a cloud, if SLD falls on you it will freeze.  If you do all of that, you'll be fine.
I'd love to be sliding up and down that thick shaft
&gt;Nothing Obama did "allowed" the rise of fascism dolt.  Except, you know, being a bad president who got nothing done for 8 years, didn't give a shit about the midterms or the DNC and then decided to go all-in for Hillary.   All of which are things that have led directly to Trump being elected.

I feel you put too much into the graphics and not enough into content (though the content you do have is quite good). For an entry level position one page is ideal. I feel you could get this content into one page pretty easily.   Your side graphics are kinda cool but the metric is arbitrary and they might give you harder questions since you claimed to know something in and out that it turns out you know know a college level of. The reason i didn't continue after my masters is i realized i was learning way more working than i was in school and getting paid for it vs paying. Most companies don't expect a lot out of you out of college because they know you really only know the basics even if you feel like you know it all. I was interviewing with someone at Lockheed Martin that had put a rover on Mars and had been working for 30 years. If i said i knew C++ at a 4/5 level he would have laughed at me because a 4/5 for him would have put me at 15 years of work experience. But they didn't except me to because i was fresh out of school and are absolutely fine with that. Basically what i'm saying here is instead of saying you know know these things at various levels, you can condense that section to a small comma separated list of things you know without ratings and use the extra space to go over stuff you have done to demonstrate your skills vs rate them yourself. Then again if you don't need the space then it does look decent and makes yours pop vs others. Then again some engineering positions don't like the pop as they feel it is you trying to fill space or distract from not having other content. I have a two line section of mine that has a list of all languages and software i know or have used.   Another thing you should try and mention if there is room is demonstrating leadership and teamwork skills. That can be in projects or in clubs outside of school/work.   Classes are good to have on there especially ones related to the field you are applying for and particularly projects/group projects. I like to keep my resume to one page but my draft version is 1.5. When i'm applying i tailor it to the particular position. So i reword some sections to make it sound more appealing to the company/position. You can get keywords to add in off their recruiting page or application page if it's for that particular position. I also remove the less relevant stuff to make it one page.   Speaking of customization, you don't seem to have a mission statement or anything like that. You're going to want one.   I'm also lazy and didn't actually read it all so i don't have any comments on grammar or whatever. But i did like how you used action verbs and different ones for each bullet. Repetition is boring and whoever is reading this is also reading 20 others while also doing their actual job. Thus why keywords and stuff are important. That's also why many people like single page ones.   &amp;#x200B;  If you want any examples i have several versions of mine as well as a lot of friends from the same field. I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. Feel free to DM me.

This may come off completely ridiculous, but whenever I came across dangerous and overly aggressive men, I would up my level of crazy to match or go beyond theirs.   "Oh ya...I know your type very well" - Creep   "You do? So you're familiar with women who could slit your throat and still go to sleep peacefully. That type?"   100% success rate of backing off during my early 20s. Haven't had to go to that extreme yet now in my 30s.
thanks you and you are welcome =))
Cool.  I only had to do it once, I think, and not with this one. But I would think our experiences at least go to show that unlike the opinions of some people, it's not some sort of site-wide problem that needs to be altered.

Something changed in their play after the Bayern game in CL. I don't know if there was discussion in the locker room behind closed doors, or simply something happening organically, but things seem to be going in the right direction ... I'm cautiously optimistic about Spurs' chances in the near future.

I'd say acknowledging challenges you're not fit to meet is very healthy. Pretending like disabilities are not difficult to deal with doesn't help anyone imo.  Disabilities are worse. They're absolutely worse. That's the challenge. In my mind trying to ignore the realities of disabilities is enforcing the idea that ones self-worth is impacted by the disability.

CPS isn't the boogy-man. If you are being honest and it's a wild overreaction, they aren't going to do shit. If you pick up the phone, call CPS and go "My 6 year old niece stole a cookie. She's obviously not being raised right. That's abuse!". They aren't going to do shit. But how exactly is CPS going to know that there is a pattern of abuse if no one calls the minor shit in? A kid could get hit 10 times in the public, only 1 person calls it in because "I don't know the backstory." and all CPS knows is that the kid got hit once and they can't do shit even though the kid gets hit so frequently that it happened 10 times in the public eye. Most abusers are smart enough to not do shit that people can see, that's why we try to look for signs such as bed-wetting. Just.fucking.call.

My chonky boy Sid (here's a [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3QXQhSh8mw/) of him in action, being a goob) looks like this laying down too, so hard to gauge from the position your boy is in.   Sid went from 25kgs to 30kgs in the first two months and for the last year sits right on 30-31kgs every time we weigh him. He was eating exclusively kibble in the shelter and had terrible chronic colitis (plus his gums were a mess and his coat was raggy), now he's raw fed and he's so healthy and shiny, plus his vet who is a greyhound specialist always says what great condition he's stayed in for being out of racing for so long, it won't take your guy long to fill out as he gets more comfortable :)

Hey it’s the asshole who got the most controversial post of all time (before it got removed anyway) I really shouldn’t do this as it’s probably just gonna fuel my ocd obsession one way or the other, but here goes *Reasons for trans*:Not a massive fan of body hair, I don’t have a strong desire to lose it but it’d be nice to have a little less.  I considered cross dressing at one point. I jerk off to futa/trap porn frequently, although I don’t really self insert in it at all. I used to wear long sleeved shirts and pants even when it was hot out. iirc I liked the style and the extra protection from insects but that still keeps me up at night for some reason. I’ve never really wanted to be a “burly manly man” I used to think a vascectomy was getting your testicles cut off, and was ok with the idea of it happening to me, even though after I found out what a vascectomy actually was I thought it was way better I feel occasionally feel anxious when referred to as male, but I still want to be referred to as male. *Reasons for cis*:I’m really happy that I was born a guy and if I could pick my agab I’d pick male without thinking. I’ve always loved playing as male characters in games, to the point that I am sort of put off if a game only has a female protagonist and I prefer male/ambiguous characters in online games. I’ve been jealous of other guys, and I still do feel jealousy whenever I see a guy with nice abs or hair. I really like most of my masculine features, such as being tall, having short hair, and having a deep voice. My habits during this period of questioning strongly match those of an OCD obsession, and I have intrusive thoughts about this topic frequently. When my intrusive thoughts stop I feel *extreme* euphoria and sometimes I’m so happy I repeat phrases like “I’m a boy” out loud to myself just to make it better. I feel repulsed whenever I imagine myself with feminine features and I dislike some I have (or at least think I have)  She/her pronouns just don’t feel right at all. I have a crippling fear of developing gender dysphoria or becoming trans.  And the biggest one: I’d rather kill myself than transition. Even if I did have dysphoria I’d prefer to stay as a man because I just like being one. Welp that’s everything. Brb gonna go ruminate about how I’m lying to myself somehow

The idea took the longest.
Empathy for animals is one thing, but poor pet ownership because someone doesn't bother to understand their pets is another.  For example, you see a lot of complaints from people about how their cats act out, and don't seem to even consider there's a reason for that. A lot of people get cats and think they're just passive animals that require no work, when in fact a happy cat requires some specific environmental conditions and daily play time to spend their energy.

what? yeah for sure
another thing against 2B is her game nor the original Nier have been on Nintendo; every 3rd party has had some kind of game from their series or greater franchise on a Nintendo system announced or released before their inclusion  and then the guy from Capcom said that if fans wanted Dante in Smash they should hope a DMC game gets on Switch which implies it is a requirement before a 3rd party series is considered for Smash.

You have reached someone. You've found hope. And take some small solace in the fact that you're reacting like any sane mind would react to this system that's fundamentally broken at its core. It's horrible, and the suffering is unbearable. But look at these strangers stepping up to help however they can. They don't know you, but many of them are taking the time to respond and help. It's a small thing, but so is a redwood seed.  You've been told how to feel about life, how to feel about authority, and how to feel about your place in the world. And it was all wrong. You don't know your own feelings anymore because your mind has locked those away. The cognitive dissonance your feelings caused wasn't something you could bear until now. You were told that to be a good person, to be safe, to be accepted you must feel a certain way about many things. And those instructions were wrong. And the only feelings that are still accessible to you as part of this corruption are coming to the surface as you begin to wake up. Rage, melancholy, shame, fear.  The world you've been living in is incompatible with your nature as a human being. And anyone you've seen that appears to be doing well in this world is actually suffering terribly. They've just been successful so far at hiding it. This empire of mind is insidious. It's actually trained us to self-oppress. Like crabs pulling each other down as they try to climb out of the bucket, we all sit together trying to convince everyone else we're fine because obviously everyone else is, so it must be 'me' that's a failure.   But you're beginning to find your way out. You have to take the journey yourself, but you don't have to take it alone. There are helpers, friends, and lovers that you'll meet along the way, and the love you're going to find will astound you. But as you get ready to trudge out the cave, I'd like to offer this advice. Learn to truly love yourself, and once you've started that, you'll be able to begin untangling your real feelings and from there, purpose will come and signpost will start to appear. So treat yourself with all the kindness you can imagine. Set boundaries wherever you feel uncomfortable. And always consider the middle path.  “Let yourself be drawn by the stronger pull of that which you truly love.” ― Rumi

Absolutely committing to this-- I've been waiting *way* too long to actualize things. Thank you so, so much for posting this!
This advice might seem a tad left from center but bear with me. Have you heard of the [Brahmaviharas](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn46/sn46.054x.wlsh.html)?   These are Divine Abidings that we are meant to cultivate. Anyway, karuna (compassion) is often misunderstood in the west, likely due to our own Judeo-Christian culture. What we are not meant to do is to feel the sufferings, hurts and pain of the other person. There is no cathartic or clarifying wisdom in that approach. What happens if we do this is that our own energy is attenuated, our pain multiplies and we begin to flail.  What we are supposed to cultivate is a feeling of kindness and goodwill that acknowledges the suffering of others and seeks their release. However, the mind imbued with karuna is not desperate, overwhelmed or angry, it is assured and confident and light. Even in the face of incredible suffering. (And btw, karuna is limitless. It's not only for the 'victims'. As it grows, it realizes the victim-hood of all sentient beings.)  Perhaps you might use this understandable pain you are experiencing and work on transforming it so that you can bring your best to the people in your life and whatever causes you are drawn to.
I think you might be a bit off on what is meant by store of value. If something "stores value" it just means that you don't lose value by putting money there. If you leave your money in dollars, you lose value, because value != dollars.

*I was talking tax payments, at rereading it sounds like you mean not running payroll at all?*  Yes. You have to make timely tax payments, and that means for estimated tax payments you are assessed a late payment penalty if you don't make them each quarter AND don't meet a safe harbor.  So you can just make sure your withholdings meet the safe harbor of last year's tax liability, and then you'll be fine.

Well i generally support some sort of healthcare overhaul. Id actually like to cover everyone but the rich. Medicaid for most is what i call it  Youre right. Its hard to tell someone that. Its a flaw of democracy. Doesnt change the fact that its even better for them in the long run and doesnt mean we shouldnt try to get it across

Its been an issue with our bigs doing this ever since Atkinson became coach. DeAndre is pretty fucking lazy though lol
honestly i think the fact that she won’t let you medically transition until you’re 18 is fair, because that’s the parental responsibility and i respect that even though it’s hard (i’m in the same situation).   however bringing up the fact that you’ve been born one way and should stay that was has always been considered rude imo because we know that and have been telling ourselves that for a long time and when we finally have the confidence to tell someone they pull this card.  idk what to advise you to do except you gotta wait it out. i’m sorry. i wish there was something i could recommend, but again i’m in a similar situation so if i find a loophole or piece of advice, i’d be happy to help  in the meantime surround yourself with people who accept you, even if it’s only one person or online people. it helps a lot. i have faith that you’ll be able to transition and stay with your family if that’s what you decide  good luck!
I'd rather control the battles than see how well the AI does. If there is too much incentive for defense then the game becomes more about how good the player's roster is than how well they play, which there is enough of already

The doorbell rings and I am greeted to a small group of kids, one dressed up as superman and the others as a mummy and professor x.  "Trick or treat!", they cry in unison and present their buckets, expecting treats.  I drop a few toothbrushes in there.   The mummy threw a toothbrush at me and told me I suck.

Hey I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through this shit time and feeling so low right now. You are an amazing individual with unmeasurable worth, if your ex wants to be out with some other person probably having a mediocre time at best, then I think the best way to get back at him is to just purely live your life happily and unapologetically. There is someone out there who is your person, and they will never make you feel anything like the way you do now. That’s not to say that you need to be with someone in order to feel better or like you have worth, just that this person is absolutely not even worth giving them the satisfaction of bringing you and your night down. You are completely valid to feel any way that you do, just know that each day the hurt will become less intense and you will find peace and happiness with yourself because you deserve to feel amazing
People can't make up they're mind about things. Whatever movement makes people feel more important will get followers that will stay with it until it either crumbles or gets bigger.

Hey this is Reddit sir, speaking facts equal to both sides is frowned upon here. It’s Lib or nothing around these parts, we’ve done more typing here than actually gone out to vote and you best respect it.
he said it in the interview he did with chris haynes last year. i dont have a time stamp, but its in there.   i think the wiggs stuff was just people sorta assuming it cause everyone likes to hate him.
Yes. If you create a league, you can go to the file and change the conference ID to 0.  It should look like  "cid":0  or something on the lines of that. If you do this to every team, it will just be 1 giant conference. Divisions don't matter anyway so don't worry about them.
Rather rubbish post. All but one response are "Yeah if your partner rejects you just be patient." I envy them. They think they are talking about single rejection or your wife/husband wanting sex 3 not 4 times a week. When people look at being rejected 29 times out of 30 in each month sometimes more you can fuck right of with "be patient" it takes 2 people to be happy in relationship and "compromise" isn't about always doing about what LL wants.   Compromise would be LL having sex more often than they want while HL doing it less often. Working some sort of solution that works for both.
To be fair, the numbers he's given have the carry lh about ten thousand times more than they deny, which would be 1 deny every 50 games for most carries. Sounds about right..
Thanks for the tip! Usually I just wrap the jar in my shirt and it works fine. There's a jar opener in the house somewhere if I ever run into a real problem, lol.

Yes, I’ve worked in both, and in retail, and in a number of other field.  Manager is easy because your exposure to abuse is reduced. But there’s a greater responsibility there. For example, when idiot teenagers call off work again, the manager has to figure out how to fill the slack, quite often by himself.  I’m not putting down people who are earning the minimum, because I was once there myself. But the plain fact is that no skills ￼￼ or special training are required before taking the job, anyone can do it from a 16-year-old twerp up to a 75-year-old retiree; in fact I know people in wheelchairs running registers.  I did agree with you, though, that limiting the faces of a company to people at this level is disingenuous.￼￼￼

I wonder why you bothered posting this. You’re not willing to listen to any one else’s opinion despite that everyone is saying your in the wrong.   I’m a parent of an autistic 18 year old and I am doing everything I can to encourage him to take responsibility and be independent. The only way kids develop maturity is through making their own mistakes and choices, then dealing with the consequences. It’s normal development for them to want to do things for themselves and move out. You should be encouraging this. Teach him to cook, clean, do his laundry in preparation. Get him to do a small part time job to help him earn money and be in the world.   If you carry on being so over protective you will prevent him becoming independent- which, to be honest, sounds exactly what you want. Doing this will drive him away from you and you’ll end up losing him completely.

Nice work, jpeezey! Super minor feedback, if you don't mind. I *think* it should be tic, not tick. For the first time, when it refers to habits. The second time, when it's a sound, I think it's tick like you have it.  In the paragraph that begins with   &gt; “You better hope not, or else she’s already dead,” I said sharply.   I think that the ending of that paragraph   &gt; Now, does Lexie have any odd habits?”  should mirror the previous time he asked the question   &gt; Does she have any strange habits or ticks?”  Or have more similar wording at least (odd instead of strange).  The only overall complaint I would have is that this leaves a **lot** of questions unanswered. Like it's almost *too* intriguing or maybe too vague. I know you cut down nearly half of the story, but it might be worth sacrificing a bit of dialogue or some more verbose areas in order to provide us a *little* more information? Like more about the pit? or more about this pleasant company?  Overall, I really liked it! And that's an impressive number of words to trim! I want to read more for sure, it's a very intriguing and engaging start to the story. Nice work!
For me it mostly is the porn. I'll just think to myself "That was one hot feral pinup" and suddenly remember I am around other people .\_.

Did you just assume the last few thousand years have been anything other than a predominantly patriarchal society to such a degree that in English the very story of humans is called "his story". Don't get me wrong it's bullshit that one sex dominated anothers rights for such an enormous amount of time but I believe the current estimate of active duty combat roles is skewed 89% male. Statistically, both median mode and averagely  speaking, using the common phrase of the USMC  of "No Man Left Behind" actually includes transgender, female, and any other self identifying persona, so long as we don't leave a body to rot on a battlefield. In this case directly supported allies (financially, logistically, and personally) the Kurds of northern independently governed Syria jointly fought ISIL (ISLAMIC STATE In iraq and the LEVANT) or my personal preference Da'esh (al-Dawla al-Islamiya fil Iraq wa al-Sham) which roughly translates as the derogatory Arabic verb meaning "to tread underfoot"or "trample down" were abandoned to be massacred by Russia and Turkey (Which is officially a US "Ally") forces within the week.  So...  Holy fucking shit stop being a fucking sheep. Go find some not fox news related regurgitated garbage to spew.

Because all the other swordsmen ended up fighting each other to decide whose sword style was the most worthy of being taught to master (Even Munenori got involved).

It started as a plan to plant a 10 mile wide tree wall, but they eventually figured out that farmers were already cultivating trees in their fields. The farmers wanted trees for all the useful materials they could get, so they allowed them to grow in areas they were already cultivating for food crops. Wherever a tree sprouted, they'd keep it going until it was mature enough to be useful. Because of that, they almost accidentally repopulated barren areas with trees.  It's being backed by the African Union.

Crossplay off, very very rarely get a xbox player with a kbm. But crossplay on, almost every single match searched has kbm players, even quickly found games.

God forbig her man tells her to try to slim down. Going by womens' logic women should always be accepted "as they are" but men should always "strive to be better". The hypocrisy and double standarts are unbelievable.  Reminds me of some bullshit I heard on a national TV show. A woman said that just because all women can be mothers they should all be considered "saints". I was speechless. So a woman should be labeled as a saint just because she has a vagina? That's entitled women going full retard right there.

My partner and I currently use withdrawl and he's done it perfectly every time, since I'm on the shot I've used my contraception perfectly as well. I also use spermicide before we have intercourse. I might buy a caya diaphram like suggested, as for my hormonal birth control I am planning on going on the pill. Does anyone have good suggestions for combination oral contraception brands?
The dildo one was the always the better one anyways.

No, they really aren’t at all. That would literally defeat the purpose of any game. Why would anyone make a game that you can only play successfully with a $180 controller? You. Don’t. Make. Sense.

I don't know about that but, humanity always finds a way. Even if they are technological advance the usa military is mostly vulnerable to EMP weapons they are starting to put in some EMP resistant on their equipment slowly, it can only reduce its interference until it becomes too strong. You can make homemade versions I heard sometime ago the usa military develop emp grenades that can destroy electronics in a few meters but, there are emp bombs that can take down a city or the country. If you want accomplish a even ground for revolution take down their electronics. There nonething the government can do about it except, some strong emp resistant equipment but, that will not be cheap for the government and they have to go and fix or replace any electronics that be disaster to the government. I know these days it doesn't seem that way realistically but, i always say this to someone "only the smartest criminal/rebel can beat the government system." If he knows tactics and strategy and very good at it he will win as long as they follow and execute correctly especially, staying ahead of the Gov't at all times.

Hi. My-ID is not a separate app. My-ID uses DPASS which is built on ICON (you can download it in your app store! I already have my ICON DID!).  DPASS is the DID creator for My-ID. Which means whenever users from these partnerships use My-ID, DPASS will also be ran as a service so additional transactions will be generated on the ICON network.   You can check P-Rep candidate ICON DAO's medium account for reports on ICON's activities and how they correlate to ICONLOOP, we fact check and get updates directly with the Foundation all the time to keep the community informed!: medium.com/icondao  Hope this helps.  Addendum: That 2nd article posted is not MyID. It is a different project called Initial ID. My-ID's announcement will be on Nov 5th!

&gt;When you get it upgraded the rate of fire with the damage ignoring shields can make quick work of most enemies...tough bosses you might want something else but most of the time it's a great weapon for groups.  No, it really isn't.  The damage is really rather low.  The only reason it seems quick (when in the secondary attack) is because it bypasses shields (yay!) and does damage to a lot of enemies at once.  Now that's all well and good, doing a "lot of damage" (not actually all that much) and all that, but it's all spread out.  It's a gimmicky weapon.  It looks cool, but it doesn't work all that well.

Depends. Usually it's some combo of wrong ammo type and aftermarket mags. Sometimes people also grip the mag while firing and cant it a little unknowingly adding to issues.   If you run factory mags and 115gr ball ammo (standard pressure) they generally will run just fine (mine does). If it still doesn't at that point it may need some heavy cleaning/smithing (polishing feed ramp, new recoil springs, etc.), but there are plenty of folks out there with examples that run well.

I love this series. I really love this series LMFAAAOOOO what a riot of a chapter. Like everything about it was perfect.   But I have to start with this, Kashiwagi, man I never really cared for her character. She was good for comedic reactions of the crazy shit she would hear from these wacky characters and some of the situations she would be in with her boyfriend when they would get caught almost fucking, but like over the last maybe 3 times she's appeared she has risen as a very likeable character for me. Lmaoo this is by far their best interaction together.   And Kaguya lmaoo she was so baka, so cute, so wholesome. She's so in love she can't help it lol I wonder if someone is gonna tell her how advanced the shit she's saying is, about going to miyuki's house and the miso soup shit 😂 (jus a random ps, this shit is more hilarious knowing the full meaning behind that, and this is the 2nd time I've heard about it. Oregairu being the 1st, 8man telling saika that). Poor hayasaka, good thing she running away. Kaguya would probably fucking kill her with all this lol the call back to the booby grab chapter 👏  👏  👏  really, never would've thought that would be recalled at all. Burst out laughing seeing that panel. Went back and reread it, is still freaking great.   Kashiwagi does have a point though.. if eventually it comes (lul) to that point, maybe when they can't be together due to college 👀, when she starts to feel that she might want to have SE... lmao love that that came back. When she might want to have sex, that could be a disaster. OR she will learn from the disaster that will be when she watches that DVD, because that's OBVIOUSLY gonna be some fucking weird stuff she's gonna watch lol really, kashiwagi? From your mom's collection? Lmaooo you don't know what kind of freak she is.  Ohh sweet summer child kaguya.   And lmaooo iino is slowly being revealed to a probably big pervert. She's either watching them because she confiscated them and got curious and well.. liked it, or just a closet pervert lol either way,  I hope it's not something darker like it usually is with our poor girl lol also idk if she's healed already, I think it was just a mistake. But would not be surprised if she faking it now.

Thats fair. I feel like he left in the worst possible way he could've gone. Not the worst a player could left, but the worst he could've left. He missed practices and started flirting with other clubs while still being under contract with us and flat out stopped talking with clubs officials. Still, its a shame he didn't stay cuz, just like you say, he would've been a danger to tired oppositions and despite his obvious shortcomings, he still is a better finisher than Rashford is ATM. I feel like he would've stayed to fight for his place had Ole showed a little more confidence in him, but alas, it is what it is.

It's an interesting topic—when a warning label should be applied to a product. I am a knife collector and I would be upset if a warning label were applied directly to the blade, though many companies do choose to include a warning label within the product box. In fact, it seems most dangerous products include some kind of warning label.  I don't think I would argue against the placement of a warning label on something like a wood chipper, a dangerous chemical product, or a drug like acetaminophen. I guess one of the questions to ask is: what kind of products should include warning labels? Further associated topics to consider might include: the delay in feedback for injury when using the product; the severity of injury related to the product; the number of injuries associated with the product.

This is absolutely true, but for most, it’s impossible to get body fat as low as you’d like without building a lot of muscle, even with a perfect diet.  I have visible abs at 125 lbs. I never did when I was 110-115, back before I had a significant amount of muscle.

Hey buddy, your tool is upside down.
I wouldn't have liked any of those options as a kid and I would hate to do that every day. I can imagine the rants I would've gone on about that. I would never choose the hug option or the dance option, and the high five option takes too long and I'm certain I would've hated that.   I'm not against this idea, I just think there should be a 4th option that's just saying Good Morning or something. I was a weird kid and I would've hated doing that every day.

I work as a medicinal chemist in a pharma company, specifically the r&amp;d side of things.  I make target compounds for a specific disease state from start to finish.  I synthesize them, purify them (using techniques such as recrystallization, column chromatography, and HPLC), and use a couple of analytical techniques (NMR and LCMS generally)  to ensure their purity before registering and submitting them for assaying.  I absolutely love the work and it pays well.  I generally get to use varried techniques/reactions/synthetic strategies and I've found it to be intellectually satisfying as well as having pretty awesome job satisfaction.  I get to work on developing drugs which may end up helping tens of thousands of people or more.

[Is this](https://imgur.com/a/jQEzpaG) a good raid composition?  This is my guild right now, we're 8/10 MC and 1/1 Onyxia, we have new people, Pserver people and we have done two MCs and two Onyxias , the first one with like 10 pugs, the second one with 3 pugs and next week hopefully with no pugs.  I feel like we're too slow, this is my first time raiding in Classic but AFAIK MC should take 2 hours, it takes us 2 days. We raid from 8:30 to 11:30 two days, on our first raid we got 5/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, on our second raid we got 6/10 the first day and 8/10 the second day, that was mostly due to people not having Aqual Quintessence and having people go out mid raid, then getting them in, it was a shitshow and we tried to do Domo with like 30 people and didnt work out, our strat wasn't the best either and was based on Pserver info.  We have some full Pre-Bis gear but most are 50% and a few have like 10% Pre-Bis, we also have some MC gear/t2 heads thanks to the two raids that we have done and we arent using consumables, next week they're obligatory and we're doing loot council and all that because we finally have a core but im wondering if our problem isn't that but actually that the composition is garbage, i mean i've seen videos of people doing speed runs with like 20 Fury warriors, we have 2. I've seen top end guilds with 1 druid and we have 3, locks do basically no DPS but we have 5 for Garr, we also have 3 hunters and most guilds have only 2, we even had an Enh for one raid but that guy is not coming back. Does my guild have a future?

What?  The article brought up lower income, not I. For find that being totally irrelevant. Much less bringing race, (which you alone mentioned, not I nor the article!), that has zero to do with returning a book in late.  Hell, I grew up in a poor/lower middle class blue collar working community of all races. This library fine matter has zilch to do with any of that. People are people across the board everywhere, anywhere... those who care, those who could give a rats-ass about anything.   And as far as late charges, where's the studies and efforts to find out how many wealthy say, "fu*k it, chump-change to me if a damn book is late! Who cares?" And then are habitually late, they'll just get around to it when convenient for them alone. That's another reason the article is one sided, for it does not look at all sides of the proverbial coin.  So let's end this with yes, the very simple things we agree on are all that matter in this matter.
Crazy old lady I do yard work for for cheap told me I’m her I’m her hero for helping make her garden beautiful again. She’s pretty cooky and has no close family or friends, her neighbors all hate her and she hates them. Pretty lonely nutjob type, but the type where she’s just neurotic and paranoid af but not necessarily dumb. Anyway she always says her garden is the thing she has that brings her the most joy and she was sad that she couldn’t keep up with it anymore due to a back injury. I’m pretty sure half of what she pays me for is just to come talk to her and be a “friend”.  Only reason I work for her is cuz that just breaks my heart to think about so it’s really nice and makes me happy to hear that she’s pleased with my work and that my efforts can help bring her joy and happiness even if it’s just for something little.

I tried and failed several times using a variety of methods.   What worked and has continued to work is calorie counting. I calculated my TDEE and deducted about 500 calories from that number and stuck to it religiously. It sucked a lot at first because I was used to snacking all day and overeating at every meal, so I felt hungry all the time. But eventually I calibrated and now I don’t even need to log my food in order to stay at 125-129 (depending on the time in my cycle).   I did almost zero traditional “workouts” to supplement my weight loss. However, I enjoy being physically active throughout the day and I have a 2-year-old who loves playing outside with me. So I’m running around on my property or playing on our playground a lot. I’m sure that helped.   Mostly it was a lot of little boring decisions that added up to one drastic improvement in my life.
My current position is way better than the last one .  There was many of the same issues, biggest was the imbalanced workload. Some days the workload was insane and other times there was nothing at all. Higher ups kept telling my boss that our department was going to be phased out and I got a lay off notice twice in the same year. There weren't any options to do new things or learn and no way to promote. Always being watched, if we werent actively working (moving around , shuffling papers etc) for the entire 8 hours we would be scolded by the department head.  My direct supervisor was an absolute angel though. I miss her, but not that horrible place.

Like most people in my country I don't believe in god. If there was a god he wouldn't let anyone suffer, and there is also no scientific evidence in god.  I like the principles of christianity, but I have a few issues with it. One of the issues is that 800 years ago my country was invaded by people who were spreading christianity and destroying my countries culture. A lot of people died in those wars, and eventually we lost. It is a very sensitive topic, just like colonization in America. Most of the issues with christianity are because of the forced, brutal way it was spread.  I don't mind if people are religious or in what god they believe in, I don't like when people try to push their beliefs.  One thing that bothers me is that most christians have never read the bible from start to end.

Fascism is completely open to constructive criticism. A State that censors any kind of criticism is a scared and unprepared State.  However, the Press wouldn’t be allowed to spread false and malicious criticism in order to weaken the State. In this case the government would have the rights to sue a newspaper that spreads fake news. And stricter punishment could be applied if necessary.  Today in the democratic system the Press can freely publish fake news and manipulate the population to their interest. Doesn’t that sound completely ass backwards?
Tom Bombadil?
Hate the phrase Fatally shot. It's a round about way to say that he murdered somebody.

Hi mate, couple of questions if you don't mind!  1) How smooth is each component? I've seen some videos where the slider, pan and tilt are all working together flawlessly, and other videos where even just the pan on it's own is jittery. What's your experience?  2) The main reason for purchase will be for VFX work - repeating the same movement mulitiple times. Obviously, for this the movement has to be 100% exact each time. Is this the case, and have you used it for any VFX?  3) Here's a YouTube link:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSKqmJs\_CRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSKqmJs_CRA) At 4min 44secs there's a shot where a girl picks up a mug - the cam then slides, pans and tilts to her face, then continues to slide pan and tilt to the guy across the room. In the video they're using the motion kit, but if I'm understanding stuff correctly shouldn't a sliderone and 2 headone units be able to produce the same shot (obviously without the rack focus)? Will that shot be possible with your setup?  Thanks for any help!
Hence I can't stand ASMR haha. I made a video a little while back explaining my "point of view" as an audio guy regarding ASMR..  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjjsVA6cnKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjjsVA6cnKE)
It didn’t used to be a thing in germany. It only developed in about the last five years. I assume it has to do with american influence over social media.

Who's your next rb behind Zeke? You need to compare the point differential between your rb2 and Kamara to that between Hopkins and Chark or Tate. The difference between Hopkins and Tate or Chark could be collosal, especially in full ppr
Good luck to you! I'm in the middle of Student Teaching. Stuffs a pain, but it's all a process and you have to accept it's a process or you will drive yourself mad. Always remember that. Keep your head up, always take criticism as a way to improve, and fuck the edTPA!

I work in the medical field, aka I’ve dealt with quite a bit of death. In my experience, I’ve always noticed an overpowering smell of mint and flowers when death is upon someone. Without failure every single human that has passed away in my presence has smelled of mint and flowers. It’s good to know that I’m not crazy lol
On the whole it's only the most sophisticated investors that understand how to use derivative products. For the rest, it's pure gambling (this is statistically accurate).  The amount of influence you can introduce into the system through derivatives is pretty extraordinary. Throwing a "focused with intent" 100x leverage behind a bet ensures that the most sophisitcated investors can throw their weight around more easily. Ultimately this can only result in giving them more control of the Monero price/market.   These financial products do not concern anybody here that I know of.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WAwikdqWHo&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2033
No idea. They had me convinced for years.
At some point you have to either Block/Unfriend/Unfollow these people or get them psychiatric help.
There was a podcast that hosted several people who Ashley plagiarized from, but I listened to it several months ago and unfortunately I can’t find it. If you look up “crime junkie plagiarism” it should give you plenty of articles though.   Basically the gist of the podcast was specific instances where Ashley or Britt would read, verbatim, a post or script from a previous podcast or Reddit post. They all gave several examples of this happening. The majority of the time they contacted Crime Junkies and they just quietly removed the specific episode with plagiarism.   Ashley posted something recently about how they always cite their sources, and if they could no longer access a source they removed the episode, but to my understanding these were the plagiarized episodes they were called out on.   Really wish I could find the podcast exposing the plagiarism, it was really detailed and shed a lot of light on the subject. If I find it I’ll send it your way.  Edit:just found it!

Ah, I see! Thanks for the info, man! I appreciate it.
Gr3 has to start. Evans can lead second unit when he is back. I still don't know what to make of Chriss, but he could be shaped into a PF instead of Dray pulling double duty.

NTA. Screw that guy, if you had an interview and you stated your demands to work there and they want to hire you then they have to abide by it.  Also not being paid for restaurant training is complete BS.  Good job OP, I would definitely walk out on opening day too.  You technically aren't effing them over bc they definitely effed you over first.  That business won't last long.  Do not feel at all even slightly bad about this
Also twitch has one of the best primaries in the game with the f2 if you really want a good gun  Zofia is also a good one but i heard alot of people suggest her already
Actually if you looked up what ergonomics actually means instead of what it gives you in the game, the rubber eyecup is literally the definition of good ergonomics.

&gt;Globalisation is what caused power to accelerate to the top.  Capital being able to move freely between countries yes. When the elite became a global elite and they could bend and shape the rules to their will at the expense of the majority.  That's now coming back to bite them in various ways.  &gt;Our social structure has existed for far, far longer than that.  Not really. In the scheme of things for the majority of our history over 92% we had totally different social structures.  Basically communes.
Because they don't have high standards of cleanliness. They are okay with trash sitting on the coffee table for days. So, they put off chores that don't interfere with their day. Trash littered around the living room doesn't stop them from using it. Dishes in the kitchen does prevent use, either from the sinks being filled or the stove being covered, or there being no clean dishes to use.  so, dishes do get done, but only after they've piled up. They're just one of the few chores that do get done. And so we take turns.

We usually differentiate between the main sub and this one (we usually call this one "the blog").  This sub was originally created sort of as a joke, as a way to host all the threads that were considered "unworthy" for the main sub. It eventually became a den of cynics and shitposters, and we love it.  Over the time, it has grown a bit and now some members host weekly threads like "Cool Story Bro" and "Grind my Gears".  We usually talk whatever, whether it's something in-game or in real life. We joke a lot and have a bit of dark humor, too.  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: the above joke is a reference to Coenl being both a moderator on the main sub, and in this one.
Nice he learned a good lesson that night . Never trust white people!!

"Should not" is a meaningless thing for a new company, people don't want jobbers who can't put up a fight. Stop with this. Why should they adhere to how WWE does things?  Seems like the Brandi vid is hyping Amazing Kong's return, and solidifying Brandi's turn. Basically evolving her gimmick into something more out there than just Cody's wife/Stephanie McMahon-lite.

&gt;The OT shows how even those that have sunk to the deepest depths  Sorry to be that person...but you kind of invalidated your entire comment with this line. The Dark Side is the Deepest Depths. Righteous anger and fighting to defend yourself/others are not the Dark Side. It's the difference between wrath and anger, lust and desire, and hatred and dislike. Not a hard line, exactly...but you know when you're there.   &gt; are still able to be redeemed.   Yes. By abandoning the Dark Side.

In my first year or two of guitar Marty was perfect! He was able to break down a song in a way that worked well with me. He was always slightly reconstructing more difficult songs to be easier. His tutorials definitely expanded my catalogue of music.   Nowadays I play more by ear but I'll forever appreciate Marty.

An explanation   1) is a terrible player who doesn't know how to move so he doesn't get hit and never looks above the other player's heads to see who else needs motes but he really wants to 'drop a giant on the other side'  2) Yeah, blockers are usually left alone until a person goes to bank which by then a person either invades and kills everyone or all of the motes you already banked are gone (in prime)  3) The gambit meta is machine guns, he aint killing because he is trying to invade using non machine guns/snipers so he gets wrecked instantly unless he is using dawnblade or some other roaming super but still wont be able to hit worth a shit  4) See above  5) ? Like what? I mean sure, the guy ain't Shaxx but there is no reason to call the man poor.
