"The Game" anyone? This is real and a lot of it IS creepy. But NLP and hypnosis is a powerful way of communicating and has broken down a lot of the traditional myths surrounding hypnosis. Unfortunately one of the founders [Richard Bandler](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s941m7CKft4) (among others) lays it on pretty thick in terms of his own stories. Yet, there's some truth in it. 
For the record, if you approach a woman and it's obvious that you're "coming out of your hole," she's going to find that exceedingly creepy. She's going to wonder why it is you were in a hole in the first place, and why you can't seem to be social and maintain positive relationships.
Yup

If I had to choose simply one, it would easily be LSD. But the best thing ever is a good candyflip, mellowed out at the ending with some sweet herb. You get the mind expansion of LSD, the euphoric empathy and sociability of MDMA framed in by the general pleasantness of smoking a good joint/bowl. Should not be done too often. Edit: seems I forgot the _why_.. Alright, I enjoy LSD because it's enlightening, you never know what you're gonna experience and it always exposes something from your inner life that always has been there but you never noticed. MDMA is the ultimate social experience, I simply end up being a much more nice person, and my social shyness dissipates. Together they amplify each other. Herb needs no more explanation, as said in other threads, it enhances everything. 
It was a bad few months. It started with the flu, then an ear infection, then appendicitis. And my 3rd night in the hospital I passed out, fell flat on my face and broke my nose.   Luckily, I was able to get Medical EI so I wasn't totally broke at the end of it all. The whole story is long and kinda boring.   I hope you heal fast my friend.

Ahh that sounds exactly like what I'm thinking, thanks!   I just had a little discussion with a math friend of mine and I asked him about a line... I asked if there are only 2 neighboring points for any point on a line... to me that makes obvious sense, there can only be 1 point to the left and 1 point to the right of any point on the X axis...   Then extrapolating that concept into 2D it gets weird because, doesn't that mean there would be only 4 directly neighboring points to any one point?   This stuff is so simple but its blowing my mind :)

I had weekly chores when I was growing up.. during the week my job was to go to school and do my homework, and clean up after dinner, saturday morning I did all my chores - a lot of what that kid is doing on his list. If I did all my chores to my parents' standards, then I would recieve my allowance.   Reflecting on the approach my parents took, I learned a lot of valuable lessons on the value of money, and how hard my parents worked to keep everything together with 3 kids. Conversely, my husband never had to do chores and admits that he was very spoiled.. it also took me a while to "train" him, and I dont think he was as aware of how hard we had to work just to pay the bills.   I don't think that kid is spoiled at all.. I'm a little jealous that he got more than I did growing up, but oh well. I think it's an example of fantastic parenting.

**Cannabis**  Everything else has too many side effects to enjoy the exalted status of the almighty herb.  A perfect balance of casual recreational life enhancement, and mental enlightenment.  The only negative side effect weed has on my life is a depleted bank account and a healthy distrust of law enforcement and the government.  LSD and Psilocybin are great but not something that I would want to do (or can do) with a great regularity.  I have gained much from my experiences, but they require too much mental and time commitment to enjoy with much frequency.  And it seems to be the laws of diminishing returns with their usage, the more you do them, the less significant the experiences become.  The same could be said for others like DMT and mescaline.  Stimulants (like coke,speed, and impure street ecstasy) are too addictive and make me jittery.  They can be fun in the right atmostphere, but not my favorites.  Alcohol is a great social drug, but the downsides (HANGOVERS!) are too severe.  herb doesn't give hangovers, it cures them!  Opiates are too destructive on my body, they tend to make me feel equally ill and high.  Not to mention the dangers of their dependence.

When I found out my girlfriend was pregnant I canceled band practice...for ever.   I gave up a lot of my social life, and my passion. One time during breakfast my son (then 2 yo) looked at me and said he hated me. My point being: there are a ton of very shitty moments and there are sacrifices that never occurred to me that I'd have to make. I wear a god damn suit and tie now! Once we were driving down the road and I pointed out a chipmunk by the side of the road. Just as he saw it, the fucking thing leaped in front of the car and I killed it. It was his intro to the facts of death.  However, there are magnificent moments and truly fulfilling moments that I wouldn't give any thing for. Just yesterday we went for haircuts together and he looked up and said, "dad we can't punch each other in the head because it'll ruin our haircuts" My trick was to realize that it can all be broken down into a child's stage of development and it's perfectly OK to say...this stage really fucking sux. and other stages are unbelievable.

I used to be very much in favor of 'realistic' depictions of Jesus in art, but I have come to think that paintings of black/white/east asian/etc Jesus reveal a very significant theological fact.  In Christian theology, the whole point of the Incarnation of the Second Person of the Trinity is the to facilitate the remediation of God and Man.  In other words, Christ became human to identify with humans.  The fact that he was human is far more important than what type of human he is, and I think that presenting pictures of him in a way that identifies him with the group most likely to see those pictures illustrates this theological fact quite nicely.

I had a hard time finding the right card for my close friends and family members, until got a card in the mail for my birthday from a ex babysitter.  I was excited to see that card had my picture on it and a personal message printed on the inside along with pictures of my kids.  I actually thought she had done it at walmart, so when I called her to thank her she told me she did it herself on www.sendoutcards.com/my_cards I just sent my first card for free through the site for my daughters birthday, so she could be just as surprised.  I would recommend this site for anyone who likes sending out card or if you just have a hard time finding the perfect one, just make your own and it will be sent by mail for you without even licking a stamp HOW EASY IS THAT!!!!!!
What bothers me though, is that if the Christian god existed, I would end up in hell with these rapists, just for not believing in the Christian god (among SO many others).

&gt;Personally, I can't do that anymore, since I realized that 85-90% of the people in this country are "the enemy," voting in statists who take away my freedoms and steal my money, so helping them out tastes like ashes in my mouth.  The government indoctrinates everyone, a few free thinkers are able to untangle most of the lies. The government steals, kidnaps, and kills people and a few are able to become very successful on their own terms. Most people just ride the coattails because that's what they were taught to do and it's not financially worth the effort to do anything else. The "people" are not your enemy, they are any libertarian's only hope for freedom. And any libertarian that is capable and enjoys helping people should do it because the thing standing in the way of freedom is the idea that "the government" must fix all the world's problems. Helping people helps them to understand the truth. If you turn your back on them, they turn to the government.

On the way home after work I was walking from the tube station when a homeless lady with a massive gut leapt out of the shadows of a dark alley way and asked me to explain what a word meant, pointing to a magazine ad about pregnancy. She stunk of booze and cigarettes and I could only think about how rancid she smelt, all up in my personal space, pointing to a pregnant lady.  I couldn't help wonder why she was asking me about this word hidden in the fineprint. My senses became overwhelmed and I started to stumble on the definition. My eyes blurred. The whiskey on her breath, the clothes stained with cigarettes showing way too much flesh on such a cold winters night. Then it hit me. The ad, the dark alley way, the loose fitted clothes, the alcohol.  The word she wanted me to clarify was conception, and she was trying to seduce (rape) me.

Star Wars is what's known as a film (or a series of films if you will). You see, it's a fiction, not an actual reflection of a real historical happening. So, there really isn't actually much more to the story than what you see in the film.

When I applied I got an automated response with a special code to use on their website, to take a 5 hour programming test. It was balls easy and I finished in about an hour (and then almost forgot to submit when I got distracted by dwarffortress, oops). A few days later they called and setup a phone interview, and then after that I had to *pay for myself* to fly out for an in-person interview. The interview was pretty much purely algorithmic (what's the big-O of this, of that, what's the big-O if we do this? etc), which I thought was kind of funny since their software tends to be among the slowest around as far MMO's go. Overall I give their interview process a C+.  Do they not do the automated programming test for web developers? I think that's a great screening method.

Cool.  A couple places to start:   [Marlyand Financial Aid](http://www.mhec.state.md.us/financialaid/apply.asp)   You said you were a student, so this should be destination 1.  Financial aid often gives you more than enough to pay for classes (living expenses, in other words).  Also, have you filled out a FAFSA?  Loans are a bitch, but paying a bunch later is better than being homeless and dropping out of school.   [Maryland family Investment](http://www.peoples-law.org/income/gov-ben/family_investment_program.htm)   This could also be a help.  Basically MD's version of welfare.  No shame in taking assistance when you need it; you will be paying into this when you get a job.   [Maryland Foodstamps](http://www.dhr.state.md.us/fiaprograms/fstamp/index.php)   If it comes down to it, know what you need to do to keep eating.  Foodstamps aren't just for the homeless.  If you have a place to stay but you're spending every dime on rent, this might be the way you get a dinner.   [Maryland Unemployment Help](http://www.layoffsurvivalguide.com/unemployment-Maryland.html)   I haven't looked at this too closely, but it might have vital information for you.   The most important thing I can say is, don't give up.  True story: I had a friend in college who got kicked out of housing because the RAs wanted him to rat out a friend for using pot.  He himself had done nothing wrong, but because he wouldn't rat out his friend, he lost his right to housing.  He was part of a student group that had exclusive access to a student lounge on campus.  There were maybe 10 of them and faculty never checked up on them.  Everyone else banded together and cleaned out a storage closet in the lounge and he lived there for a year.  He bummed showers off of friends in various dorms.   The point is, keep an open mind.  A couple years of inadequate living situations will be worth it when you get your degree.  The job market is pretty close to rock bottom right now so its only going to get better.  You might make some concessions in your lifestyle you'd never have considered making before, but you'll make it.

As an east indian male that lived in india and the middle east for the majority of my youth I kind of get where you are coming from... well not really... but I'm fairly buzzed and want to coment...  When I moved to North America I always stereotyped Indian girls as being very conservative and would thus not pay them the light of day. Almost all my gfs were white (couple asian - vietnamese mostly), which def didn't make the parents happy. I remember when they question why i didnt bring any indian girls over, I used to joke that I've come all the way to NA, I could have stayed out east if I wanted Indian girls. That and the enormous amounts of hair always bothered me... even if they don't look that hairy, believe me they are... its gross/  ewwie  However, last weekend I hooked up with an indian girl I met at the bar and she was wild. Would tell me what to do, wanted it doggy style, spitting on my cock like sasha gray. All in all, a great fucking time.   I'm kind of drunk here, but what I'm trying to say is, go fuck some indian girls and see for yourself, before you start stereo typing u jack ass!
Well, I'm a white male.  I was told they wouldn't have a problem with me.  Was that person being optimistic?  Hah.

Leg or knee raises, but either hanging from a pull-up bar or holding at the top position of a chest dip station (parallel bars).  Also, you can do 'cable situps' as I call them, since crunch motions are today's evil. You attach a rope attachment to a high cable pulley, face away from the machine, kneel on the ground, and bend at the hips forward. (Keep spine neutral and focus on the abs, as the hip flexors can take over the movement if you are not careful)  Also, doing a lot of overhead work while standing (such as military press) will work the core to a great deal.

Yes, but Sheridan, died and on the third day he rose from the dead.
Thanks. That sounds like a decent program, even though I do wish it would get rid of the abstinence promotion. For some reason (if other people follow that link) the link goes to the homepage, not . . .=7425, you have to navigate there yourself.  BUT, that program and Title V seem different. I got to a CNN post about it (seemed less biased) and it had these things to say about qualifying for Title V:  &gt;Programs that receive this funding must "teach that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and other associated health problems," according to the Department of Health and Human Services. To qualify, they must also teach that sex before marriage is "likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects." These are part of the "A-H definition," requirements for programs to receive abstinence funding under Title V of the Social Security Act.  The second one seems pretty horrible to me. It also doesn't seem like there are requirements for discussion of contraceptives or safer sex, which means they could be left out entirely. That is bad and means schools that get title V don't have to have conprehensive sex ed with abstinence promotion, they can have plain old abstinence-only ed.
True dat, and Jesus isn't the only one who had this happen. Statues of the Buddha started looking suspiciously Greek once Alexander the Great showed up, and went crazy and turned into the fat super asian buddha as Buddhism spread farther East.

A simple but deadly drinking game - **FIVES**  Okay, so you need a least three people to play this game. As with any drinking session though - the more the merrier! Before the game starts, you need to get one empty pint glass and place it in the middle. Everyone in the group pours a bit of whatever alcoholic drink they have in their own glass (beer, vodka, baileys etc.) into the empty glass to make the ''dirty pint''. The person who loses this game has to drink the ''dirty pint'' which should be kept in the middle.  Now onto the game itself. The aim of the game is to guess the total number made by the group. When you guess correctly you're out of the group and are safe from drinking the ''dirty pint''.  Everyone keeps one hand behind their back and on the count of three they place their hand in the middle revealing what they've decided to do (a bit like when you play rock, paper, scissors). Now you can do two things: 1) Keep your hand **opened** to indicate the number 5; 2) Keep your hand **clenched** in a fist to indicate the number 0.  So, you go round the group one-by-one saying out loud what you think the total number will be. If it is your turn to guess the total number you still have to put your hand in the middle and indicate a 5 or a 0. You have to shout out your guess whilst the ''1,2,3 - show'' count is being made.  For example, we have a group of four people. Mid-way through the count of three - Person 1, guesses that the total number will be '15'. After the count of three, all four people show their hands. Three of the four have their hands open (3x5), whilst the other one has their hand clenched (1x0). In this instance, the total number in the group is 15 , so as Person 1 guessed correctly s/he is out of the game and can drink their own drink at their own pace. (Although, its wise not to drink to much of your own drink whilst playing this game because it may inhibit your ability to finish off the ''dirty pint'' if you lose the game). Person 1 can then watch as the others get anxious and nervous because the probability that they'll have to drink the ''dirty pint'' has just increased. Its gets awesome to watch but nerve-racking to play, when its gets down to the final two people.  Its a bit of a long-winded explanation but hope its clear. Have fun!

Depends on your team size.  If you have a large team - which Amarok does - then a re-write (assuming you have good vision) allows everyone to work on their part and then intigrate latter.   Refactoring part be part requires has a lot of places where only one person can work.   You end up with one developer announcing a code freeze for the next week while he fixes everyone's interfaces to use the new changes.   Most version control can't handle merges well, so you can't really start on the next refactoring until the current one is done.
Well you'll have to level up each weapon (job) so there is that aspect of repetitiveness. Who knows, we'll have to see.

I test drove it and it was fine, had it checked out by a mechanic, thought on it a few days, and we decided to buy it.  Within a day of owning the car it started sputtering and couldn't make any power.  I checked basic stuff buy couldn't find anything.  We got in touch to say, hey this isn't what we agreed on, this car isn't working and we trusted you that it would be.  Past the first one where they confirmed they hadn't done *anything at all* to it in the interim period they wouldn't return any phone calls and wouldn't even come to the door, for weeks.  That's the closest I've ever come to vandalizing someone's house (but didn't.)  I was so disgusted with it I let it sit.  Turns out "not doing anything" was actually cleaning the engine bay by blasting it with water - since I had noticed the engine bay was quite clean they specifically denied having done so.   Once I got over my anger and realized they lied about not having done anything it was obvious they had no idea or made a mistake when cleaning the engine bay.  I removed the spark plugs and let it dry out over a couple weeks.  Car ran just fine after that.   They directly lied to me about not having done anything, if they'd just told me the fucking truth I would have figured it out much sooner and not lost them as a friend.  Don't lend money to friends unless you consider it a gift, and don't buy or sell cars to friends.  Sure, sometimes both will go ok, but sometimes things get royally fucked.
Creation screams chaos, not god.  There not only doesn't have to be a supreme being, but most likely there isn't in the sense of a god.  Maybe more advanced alien cultures, or even more advanced cultures who may have existed epochs ago (such as the legend of Atlantis), but no fairytale god. Saying that all cultures have a supreme being in no way confirms that there is one, seeing as how most religions evolved from one set of beliefs.  Since the major religions are based on pagan beliefs, they've since simply been manipulated and evolved into what they are now.  Just as you say, you were brought up to believe.  Since generation after generation people have been doing everything in their power to convince each other of a god, obviously most people will believe in it blindly.  Sorry to also put your other beliefs down, but at the time of Jesus, there were several hundred other messiah's.  It was by chance and a dash of coincidence that Jesus was chosen to be the representative of the son of god.  Keep in mind, that even in the same geographical areas there were quite a few messiah's also claiming they were the sons of god.  To add the the sad reality of the lie people are "brought up" to believe is that there really is no archeological proof Jesus really existed, since the first mention of Jesus is near 80 years after his supposed death and reincarnation. If he was such an important figure, don't you think someone would have mentioned him in those 80 years or so?  I believe the first mention would have been by King James himself, whom coincidentally also set Jesus's birth date to what we accept it as now. And I'm not about to call you narrow-minded, however blind belief is just that.  Projecting your beliefs on the world you live in because you think anything amazing must be of god is simply turning your back on the evolution of human understanding, scientifically and spiritually.

Oh, man. She really got shafted.   Well, without passing any judgement whatsoever on you patient, I'll tell of a similar case that resulted from a botched vasectomy. The family starting looking for a family to adopt. Not only did they find one, but the family they found was Thai (like them), well off, and had been trying to for conceive for over 10 years. It was a win/win for everyone. The receiving family even payed for all birth-related expenses (which, after some quick help from Google, seems pretty common).

Figure out how much you value playing with your friends vs making progress in ICC. Keep in mind that you don't necessarily have to raid with your guildmates.. they should be able to see that you're frustrated with their lack of progression and not begrudge you the opportunity to raid with others.  Then you can run pug ICC10s and hopefully find a group that runs regularly (ideally, another small guild that doesn't quite have 10 people, but whose players are more skilled than in your guild).
Dammit. My logic is flawed.

I learned persian food first, which got my basic techniques down. Persian food is very similar to desi food, even sharing a lot of the same terminology, but with different (very little) spices.  From there the jump to desi food was very simple.   I went to school for biochemistry, but ended up working in IT. The kitchen is basically my lab fix. I suggest eating critically, pay close attention to everything about the food that you eat when you are out and about, and keep that in mind when you are developing a strategy for reproducing it at home.  Good ingredients also help, and so does good equipment, you could be having a hard time getting things to taste right because your cookware is reacting to your dinner. Also, you need to learn to cook rice. Westerners have no idea how to cook rice, the best rice in the world is made by Iranians, so I suggest picking up a cookbook by Namijah Batmanlij and really get your rice skills going. It'll help when you are doing biryani or pulao or yakhni.   Like anything else, its all about having sound foundational skills, being observant, and having enough experience to figure out when things are going south early on. They only way to get those skills is trigger time and learning from the mistakes that you will make.
Props to this guy for not giving a shit!
Some people don't equate 'respect and honor' with 'money' . I for one could make much more money in another field, but I prefer the one I'm in morally and ethically.
In terms of profit, that's probably the right thing to do.  It sucks, but that's the way it is.

I have a sure fire plan.  I have a lot of capital available, but the government has frozen my assets.  I have a lawyer who can get my assets released for $10K.  Western Union it to me, and I'll wire you back $20k (is negotiable) in 6 weeks or so.  Then repost here with your doubled money.  
Yes. Yes I am. Stop being obstinate. This is basic kitchen safety.  I was badly burned working in a restaurant when I was around 20 (second degree burns preventing me from using my left hand 5 days or so while the open blisters healed) by a drop of water hitting oil. It's amazing how much oil a drop of water can jettison from a pan. It can be explosive.  And yes, like everyone else has said, just because *you* haven't been hurt, doesn't mean it's safe. It isn't.
There's some crazy stuff out there, it's just not very common.

I've been on a lot of bc indeed. So far it's been shot, about 4 kinds of pills, ring, patch. I'm aiming for IUD. The shot was my favorite because I didn't have periods on it. Ever. I mean, the first 3 months I bled, but that's not uncommon, and then I didn't have periods for 3 years. The best 3 years ever. And I've had a kid, so the IUD shouldn't be too bad, it's worse for those who haven't had one. IDK when I'll upgrade/switch, my old insurance didn't cover it, haven't asked the new insurance.

Ambrosia makes some serious gems, the EV series being a good example.  However, had I not purchased EV Nova 5 or so years ago, I would be a little pissed that it's still 30 bucks.  Ambrosia seriously needs to learn the concept of aging, as well as sales. They've been making games since a couple years after I was born, and I've been following them since then.  I remember thinking "when I get older, I'll buy EV &amp; Harry the Handsome Executive, plus they'll be cheaper".  Not so. It's now 16 years later and even the games that are 16 years old are still full price. In fact, with the exception of Maelstrom and a couple others, they are all still full price &amp; OS 9 only.

Yep sweet potato fries are excellent.  Slice, toss with olive oil and some spices (I often just do a generic italian seasoning blend) salt and pepper, bake at 350 for 45 minutes (times will vary greatly).  It also helps to open the door very briefly once or twice during baking to let the steam out.

More importantly is the fact that there seems to be some form of event going on centered around a life-sized representation of the Ninja Turtles [battle van](http://www.automopedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/turtlevan.jpg).
If you fry at 325-400F or thereabouts you shouldn't end up with oil in your food because your food should be ejecting a cushion of steam keeping the oil off of the food. It's very similar to a drop of water dancing on a hot skillet.
That doesn't make sense.  There's no such time.

You are never going to have your old life back. It's over.  It's always going to be different - from now until the day you die... So things are always going to be different -- but you will find joy again.   Have you thought of maybe taking a week off -- I didn't get to do that for like the first 7 years of my oldest boy's life... but I'll tell you -- sometimes just having a little time away... especially if you can re-capture the romance with your wife... and time to re-devote yourselves to each other... when you come back -- you will see things a little better.  I remember being so excited to get that week off -- after all those years - and the first 2-3 days it was pretty damn awesome.. but then -- I found I was really really missing my little fellow... and felt like there was this big part of me missing. It was wonderful to come back home.

A man who says, "Rather to die in absolute doubt than to die in euphoria at the price of a lie" cannot ever be considered a successor of Friedrich Nietzsche â life requires lying for Nietzsche. The question is whether the lie is a productive lie or not.  Also, it seems rather unfortunate that he has been connected to Nietzsche primarily because of his criticism of the church. If all people get out of Nietzsche is "church is bad" then they're reading him rather lazily, and without any attempt to understand him.
According to the standard practices instigated by the GOP, these guys are enemy combatants, so we can start torturing them now.  We can also include all the recent terrorists who have been attacking offices of congressmen.

You should have just left, if you didn't do anything they can't keep you there. 
I think you took the wrong approach. You can't just sit down and immediately ask them to qualify themselves (by asking them what makes them interesting).  I don't know what stories you told after that, but it sounds like you skipped the entire smalltalk/building repartee phase of the conversation and dove right into LET'S GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER REALLY WELL which, I think, is sort of creepy.  Still, shit happens. Props (or whatever people say now) for the 10 approaches a month thing. Keep it up!

I just ate a pizza 5 minutes ago by not putting it on a tray. It was delicious.
I learned that the hard way.  My fiance proposed to me with a white twist-tie he'd twisted into a ring, asking if I'd marry him when he could afford a ring (of course I didn't care if he could afford one or not).  Struck by genius, though, I decided to take it to a local jeweler's and see if they could make mold for a real ring based on the twist-tie. They got really excited, but I would have to leave the twist-tie with them so they could take time molding it and making the ring.  In the meantime, I'd been wearing the twist-tie just like a regular ring, so I had to find another white bread tie to wear so he didn't know something had happened to the original. I was in the bread aisle for almost a fucking hour trying to find a white tie. A couple times the produce guy kept looking at me like I was insane, and eventually came over asking if he could help me.  I finally found a loaf with a white tie on the bottom shelf in the very back.  It took something like four or five weeks before I got the ring and original tie back, but the ring is fucking awesome; silver and a CZ, so it wasn't expensive, but it's better than anyone else's engagement ring. (Will post pics tomorrow if requested)  **UPDATE**: [Pictures!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/48929047@N02/sets/72157623624776333/) My favorite part is actually the underside of the ring, which is distinctly twist-tie-y. It's either a size 6 1/2 or 7, and I went for a pretty small CZ so the ring was really mostly a twist-tie. Most people just think it's a unique ring until I tell them the story, and then they freak out. I included a picture of the original twist-tie, as well as the two of us in the same fifth grade class (he switched schools the next year, I asked him to go on a date with me, and then I didn't see him for 11 years) -- and the two of us now.  Also, the ring was made by [Grimball's Jewelers](http://www.grimballjewelers.com/) in Chapel Hill, NC.
I don't think we actually know how they are chosen yet.
That sentence was grating to me, but it's understandable. Your average reader has no idea who Xavier Leroy or any of his companies are, but *everyone* knows the name Microsoft. Tracing ML to F# certainly skips over a lot, but it does help relate Milner's work something most people know.

In case you aren't joking: Neverending probably refers to the fact that the book is in some ways, interactive to the person reading it, so that the world in the story continiues to change as different people read it.  I have also had a theory about the names of the only 2 people to have read the book, according to the book. That is Bastian Bathazar Bux and C.C.Coreander. It is hard not to infer that there is a A.A.A. somewhere waiting to read the book. Perhaps that is the author's proxy for the books present reader?  The book that Bastian reads inside the book is not the book that we read, BUT  the book that the Old Man of the Wandering Mountain writes clearly is the book that we are reading. Very interesting to think about.

I've been there, and it is awful. I am so, so sorry.   Let me just say this, and I have NO idea of your situation: I was really, really angry at my father and supported my mother the entire time and really didn't talk to my dad much. To my mind, he cheated and it was inexcusable.   But then you realize that people are complicated, and relationships are hard, and I've always regretted not being there for my dad during that really tough time. Yeah, he brought it on himself, but my mom was 50 percent of that relationship, and a huge part of the problem.   As much as it hurts, try to remember they are both your parents and both love you sooo much. Try not to take sides too much, and lean on your friends right now. Odds are some of your good friends will know exactly what you're going through and will be able to help you through.  Good luck, and there are people who know and care about your pain.

I enjoy it because of the characters. They don't go into much depth into them sadly, but it gives reasons for all these people to act like they do. Most Final Fantasy's nowadays are cookie cutter characters with whom I feel no attachment. I would have loved for them to go into more depth with the characters, but it might ruin it I guess. I don't know any of my friends that played the game that have the same main party either. That shows a lot of diversity in the game as well. It is and probably forever will be my favorite RPG. I play through it about once every couple of years or so just to make sure.

Shadow of the Colossus is an excellent example of the type of "Virtual Solitaire" which will never be as socially acceptable as any movie.  I played Shadow of the Colossus front to back.  I love the music.  I climbed to the top of the temple.  I finished most of the time trials.  My commitment to the game was way more than is involved in ANY MOVIE.  The longest movie I've ever watched was Solaris.  And that was only 5 hours or whatever. Everyone thought I was insane for watching Solaris, a five hour movie.  How much moreso am I insane for investing 60 hours in a game!  Hmm... If you want to compare games to something, try a TV series.  They have a large time commitment and require learning a lot about the characters and plot.  Following a TV series religiously is kinda popular... but not as popular as watching the occasional movie.  Maybe certain kinds of games could compared to TV series.  What do you think?  edit:  I'd note though that in my opinion Wander (the SotC player character) never objectively grew or developed in anything as complex a manner as any character in any TV series I have ever watched.
On the other hand, those guys have already got their machines.  If that was the case then Sony could simply discontinue Linux support on all future models, and be done with it - with less outrage from existing customers.

Troll posts can take any number of forms. Sometimes they appear to be benign inquiries into subjects that are very emotive and controversial, as this one did. There is no single definition of "troll" but usually the best one I've found is "someone who says things they either do not believe, or which are wild exaggerations of what they *do* believe, for the sole purpose of starting arguments and flame wars."  We left the thread up because lots of good discussion happened in it. That's happened many times with troll threads across Reddit. If it gets discussion going, so be it. :P

Well, if you climb up the vi learning curve, you would see that copy and paste takes a while to explain because they are implemented on top of a more general mechanism.  Once you understand those multiple paragraphs, you can copy a whole block of text in a few keystrokes, but you have also learned how to delete that block of text, or indent it, or pipe it through a filter (shell command), or save that block of text to a new file, or whatever.  In other words, it's like someone asking how to create and use a `Map&lt;String,Integer&gt;` in Java.  Once you've explained how to call a constructor, and explained a bit about generics, and explained about iterators (or about the special `for` loop syntax), you've answered their question.  But they also know a lot more about Java than just how to use a map.

Who gives a shit what they think?  Cops are pretty piss poor in general at accummulating *actual* evidence when you didn't commit a crime (mostly because it doesn't exist).  If you don't give them any every cop in the city can think you did it and they cannot convict you.  One wrong word and you'll be in prison before you know it.

I wish people who know nothing about physics would stop trying to use physics metaphors. It doesn't work.   Of course, the Buddha knew nothing about atoms. The interesting thing is that the Buddha talked about the human condition in a way that is independent of circumstantial things like physics or technology. He didn't need to know about atoms.

Here's how it went down:   Dude has party. Someone shits in a container. Some other drunk/high dude thinks its a good idea to piss in the shit container. They think it's even funnier if they close the container, and let it incubate in the sun, cause then the poor bastard who opens it to find out what is inside will get blasted with a nasty whiff of sewage.  10 hours later, everyone wakes up. Dude sees container full of unknown substance. Opens up the lid and takes a whiff. Proceeds to have hallucinations. After coming down from this awesome high, his friends tell him it was piss and shit. He says, "duuuuuuuude, we'll never have to pay for drugs again."  
&gt; Although we do kill millions of pigs and cows for all that yummy bacon and burgers. But what if I decided to shoot my golden retriever? Just because he was annoying me and I was tired of him. So I take him out in the back yard and POW right between the eyes. I'm not cool with that.  Does that give you no cognitive dissonance?  You're fine with killing animals smarter and more self-aware than your dog, but then somehow single him out as more deserving of rights?  I get being partial to him just because you know him, but you certainly can't claim that he has any real rights *whatsoever* if you don't think the other animals do as well.

My favorite story in this genre is the one where Steve Jobs needs help putting together the innerds for a video game and offers Steve Wozniac half of the proceeds (Jobs says about $800) if Woz finishes the job.  (I'm quoting this from memory, so feel free to correct me or fill in the gaps if you want.) Woz does it in 3 days and gets $400.  Later on, Woz is sitting on a plane next to a guy from the company that sold the game and tells his story.  The guy on the plane then reveals that Jobs actually got paid $8,000.  Woz said that he actually cried when he found this out.  F^ck you Steve Jobs, F^ck you indeed.
Q: If the IRA is purely a 'nationalistic' organisation, how come none of it's members were Protestants?   I understand what you are saying that religion was not at the forefront of the IRA's politics, but you cannot deny that religious sectarianism &amp; 'out-group' hatred was at the very heart of the struggle in the first place.

We used to play a game in bars called "Point 'n Mac" where we would send our friends (guys mostly, sometimes girls) up to random strangers to hit on them with preselected and often awful, offensive pickup lines. It's an international sensation. You may have been an unwitting participant in someone's Point 'n Mac game. It's quite surprising how often some really bad pickup lines work.
On my screen, I can see the top of their name. Like they forgot to raise the "height" of the passenger names on the HUD with respect to the Apacahe. So it kind of overflows the size of the screen. Look carefully next time or try adjusting the aspect ratio of your screen and you might get a glimpse of the top part of the letters in their name.

Condoning violence against living Presidents is simply unacceptable no matter what party they're affiliated with. &gt; and so we're clear.. there were plenty of threats against Bush http://www.zombietime.com/zomblog/?p=621 *There you go.*  Now you're actually backing up your claims.

There is -zero- chance of that happening. The new guy must put his stamp on the operation or why else would he be there. So he's going to implement "new ideas" that somehow always end up being a really lousy way of doing it, costing more for less.  I forget which franchise it was [in the Star Wars realm I think], where the executives had the idea of totally overhauling the game, without so much as a by-your-leave [and remember: these guys did a major executive overhaul and they didn't bother informing anyone about it]. The result: the player base, almost to a person packed up and left. The place was dead inside of 3 months or so.  If the new assclown thinks he's going to do something fabulous to make more money and he screws up the gaming experience for people they will just disconnect and stop coming.  After a major managerial change like that things always get worse. I don't even know why Blizzard had to be sold to ActiVision. Blizz was doing fine.

I've seen this lie many times before, it is a classic and it is central to the renewable delusion:  &gt;The first and most important thing to understand about variability is that grid operators already cope with it on a daily basis. Demand varies constantly, by the hour of the day, by the day of the week and by the season of the year. Grid operators regularly manage a set of generation sources and ramp supplies up and down to match demand. Integrating New Energy sources is, in some ways, more of the same. \[...\] When a nuclear plant crashes there is no warning.

Crash Nitro Kart was disappointing. I had been looking forward to a sequel for quite some time, since my CTR disc was out of commission from being used so much.  However, when I got it, it just didn't capture the kart-racing-fun feel that CTR had in spades, and I personally thought even moreso than Mario 64. I loved Mario 64, but CTR is my favorite early 3D kart racer ever.

 "Sorry something went wrong.  A team of highly trained monkeys has been dispatched to deal with the situation..."
Here, imagine this in a general sense.  We take a line (one-dimensional), we take another line and move it into a two-dimensional plane and connect them. Now we have a two-dimensional square.  Take another square, move it into a three-dimensional plane and connect them. Now we have a cube.  Take two cubes, move one into *four*-dimensional space and connect them. Now we have a four-dimensional shape most still call a four-dimensional "cube." The idea is impossible to comprehend to a three-dimensional being. It doesn't make sense when you view it, but you can see that we're not dealing with any type of motion we're used to seeing in our daily lives:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_jKXFSgZAQ (Note that this video is only three-dimensional but demonstrates the movements of a four-dimensional object.)  I imagine that learning a game like this would have more to do with paying attention to the *consequences* of four-dimensional movement rather than trying to teach you any sort of hard science. Mainly because demonstrating four-dimensional movement using a two-dimensional medium mimicking the *three*-dimensional world we're used to sounds like a losing battle if they tried it seriously :).
Well, son, if that's what you want to call it.  Your mother and I are still very proud of you.
Well, Jesus wasn't white, either. He didn't have blonde hair or blue eyes. He was a Palestinian Jew.  People have always portrayed Jesus in ways that were the norm for their culture...it just seems strange to us because in a culture where whiteness is dominant we don't notice/think about the race of people who are white. So a portrayal of Jesus that's just as inaccurate passes us by without a thought.

I was digging through a filing cabinet at the office the other day and found 25 still-in-shrink-wrap hologram-coated Windows ME upgrade disks.

I think I need to make a light fixture out of them or something, as they sure are shiny (and the holograms add some color to things).

Went to visit a friend in the dorms. I was underage and had a buddy buy me the best bottle of vodka he could (for 7 dollars). Proceeded to get shitty. Next thing I know I'm in the E.R. and they are asking me for a phone number for someone that can pick me up. Found out later that day that I had been walking around out side in my socks. Then came back into my friend who was a girl dorm room and puked all over their stuff. They finally get me to sleep. A few hours later I wake up and try to use the women bathroom in the dorm. I pass out with my pants around my ankles in a stall and someone finds me and calls an ambulance which brought me to the ER where I woke up. Man did I feel like an ass the next day. Moral of the story is spend more then 7 dollars on a bottle of vodka next time.

People who use KJV, IMO, are usually for some reason trying to obscure the meaning.   Presumably here they chose it as it's recognised to have translational errors that have been corrected/identified in later versions. As you say the NASB is often considered the most literally equivalent English language translation; I find the Amplified Bible to be useful too (hints at the texture of the words used).

I linked to a study that problematizes the belief that boys are /naturally/ (which is what I meant by 'intrinsically') better at math than girls. It doesn't disprove the belief, you're right, but it certainly brings it into question, which is of value since the finding of the study is that the belief that girls are worse at math then boys is itself a major cause of girls scoring worse at math than boys. I think this is a terrific application of the scientific method, and one with moral significance (in a negative sense, in that it problematizes a source of legitimation for sexism and suggests that certain social assumptions that people make in their interactions should be reevaluated). Anyway, it was a throwaway example on which none of my arguments relied. In two other places I said clearly that science is "great" in certain applications. And I fully believe that. I never suggested, nor do I think any of the above can be reasonably construed as suggesting that "good science does not exist." (edited for clarification... I always apparently see things I want to elaborate on as soon as I hit the "save" button).   Edit: Also... whether or not there is some natural advantage for men at the highest levels of abstract math and physics is still debated (see the Larry Summers controversy), but the history in academia (as in society in general) of institutionalized sexism is pretty uncontroversially accepted as the primary cause underlying the persistent, though gradually eroding disparity.

&gt; True, as every other member did. As it stands, Germany is the only  &gt; country close to the 3% budget deficit,  When I say Greece fudged its figures, I mean that they *misrepresented* their figures. Other countries may have had some constraints waived, but Greece outright *lied* about what their figures were.  &gt; European economics (and politics) cannot be easily perceived from a  &gt; non European point of view.  Who's perceiving what from a non-European point of view, now?  The original article talked about "workers ... sending a message that they won't pay for the crisis." If not Greek workers, then who? The money to pay for Greece's profligacy is ultimately going to have to come from Greece. And Greek workers are going to have to pay for it by retiring later, for one thing.

I think that the book serves as a good wake-up call about how civilization as we know it cannot sustain itself forever.  If you already realize this, then it is not of much value to you.  Of course, one should go from Ishmael to exploring real-world topics that have been scientifically studied, like overpopulation or uses of energy.
First off, the conclusion of this study is way too vague. How far nature has fallen. All of the subjects were women yet the authors extend their results to everyone. Secondly, the exact same game with testosterone administration was done in men and showed the exact opposite result, http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0008330  and the Zurich authors apparently didn't stumble upon this paper as its not in the references.  Perhaps there is an opposite in men and women, but to claim that this study refutes folk ideas of testosterone is preposterous as only women were used. I guess to get into Nature nowadays you need to sacrifice science for a good headline.

bad. 
plasticcow didn't cite a reference, but from what I've seen that number probably includes all types of sexual assault, not just rape-with-penetration.   The vast majority of city-residing Japanese women have been groped on the train (no, that's not an exaggeration). Very, very few of them ever report it, although that is changing now.  Another type of abuse usually classified as sexual assault by these statistics is sexual harassment, which is pretty much institutionalized here in Japan -- although that, too, is starting to change.
Point taken. I just wanted an excuse to look it up again.

This last Sunday I was in my neighborhood Trader Joe's when I turned the corner of an aisle and nearly walked right into Perry Farrell. He was shopping in the West LA TJ's on Pico with his wife and two sons. It was the oddest thing. To me this guy has been larger than life, but here he was out being nothing more than a husband and dad. I've been a fan of JA since their early days and have seen them in concert 5 times including the first Lollapalooza. I very much wanted to approach him and sincerely thank him for his artistic efforts. What stopped me was that he and his wife were clearly having a "domestic moment". I shopped around for 15 minutes trying to find an opening for a non-awkward approach. Long story short Perry never let up with the bitching... it was non-stop. Trust me, I respect Perry for all that he has created as a musician, artist, and business man. But in just 15 minutes I could see what a difficult person he could be to work with. It explained an awful lot.

Seriously, fuck graphics, fuck it and leave in the the fucking gutter to fucking die. DaoC graphics is more than enough for me in an MORPG, it's only the gameplay that matters, fucking pavlovian gamers salivating over every fucking bloomed and bump-mapped pixel, fuck.
FF13 is the first FF I've enjoyed playing since 6. Maybe I've mellowed out over the years. I'm lucky if I get 5 hours a week to play games these days, so that probably contributes to it as well - I don't really want to power game.  So I've put around 20 hours into it so far. The visuals are wonderful. And the saving grace, gameplay wise, is the battle system.  FF has always been mostly linear, so I don't get that particular gripe. If you want non-linearity, play Fallout 3, etc. It's difficult to put together a long narrative without linearity. And just like the other FFs, you can dick around at the end doing whatever you want.

From the article:  &gt; The company is taking its message to Congress. Oil and gas sector lobbying has more than tripled since 2004, reaching $168.3 million last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Koch spent $12.3 million on lobbyists in 2009, ranking it fifth behind Exxon, Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips Co. and BP PLC.  &gt; Environmentalists, meanwhile, have increased their lobbying expenditures fourfold during that same period, spending $22.5 million last year. **Greenpeace spent $46,291 on lobbyists in 2009, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.**  If you want to include Greenpeace's campaign expenditure, we should probably also look at the amount spent on advertising by oil companies.
Most people seem to think that the Cowboys denying shopping Marion Barber means they are shopping him around.  I think they probably are shopping him because they have two other proven running backs and Barber has been showing signs of injury.
I have a sick feeling the mage is probably using rank 1 of every spell. Download the add-on rankwatch and it will tell you, (and whisper them a block of text) if they are using down ranked spells. Especially now with dual specs I've seen a lot of people, including myself, with down ranked spells.
In fairness to the bishop, they *were* very bad children.
I'd agree with that. It would beggar the imagination for an oil company to fund legitimate research about climate change- unless of course they covered up the results afterwards. This has certainly happened with pharmaceuticals.

We don't get any commissions. At all. Period. And we never have. If you got bad advice, which is unfortunately unavoidable if you spend enough time in the store, it certainly wasn't to make more money. The sales metrics are so fucking complex that most employees couldn't explain to you what their own department's growth plan is, much less a single store's. So they're sure as hell not going to know what to sell metric-fucking-tonnes of to try and get a $0.15 raise in a year. There's so much valid shit to talk, but you just make shit up. Why?   Also, there MIGHT be one vendor rep in a store at a time, excluding the larger stores that have a clearly labeled Apple employee working at the Apple table. Again, you could have just stuck to the valid point, but you just made shit up. Don't be willfully ignorant. It's offensive.
First the whole I don't want to risk losing a friendship excuse is lame unless they're a best friend and you KNOW they don't have any interest you. Once you realize you're going to take it to the next step it's important to do it subtly. Do things that leave her questioning whether the relationship is more but don't straight out say it. Increase touch, sexual innuendos, and flirting. Going to a club or bar where alcohol is involved might help ease the tension slightly as well.

&gt;I am going to be an asshole and say, who cares? What is the question of sustaining the life of a person where their brain does not function.  I agree, and that's the issue. But it's not as simple as that because the definition of death that is currently used is "brain" death, which is not the same as a persistent vegetative state that has CNS function and a small, very small, possibility of allowing the individual to function in society again at some point. Right now in most states, if there is no living will, the preferences of the family might not be enough to get the hospital to take off the respirator (see Missouri v Cruzan).  Brain death is tricky because it involves all functions of the brain, so even if your brain is still secreting hormones and causing involuntary twitches, your brain is alive when there may be no hope of restoring consciousness. This is where the slippery slope argument comes in, but that's another, longer issue in itself...

I was raised in a fundamentalist Baptist church in the south. I remember one time my father caught me smoking when I was 13 years old and his idea of a fair punishment was to get a hickory stick about the thickness of of your thumb and beat me with it in front of my mother and my sisters. Later I had to stand naked in front of my mother while she pulled the splinters out. Then I had to explain to the gym teacher at the "Christian" school I attended that I didn't want to dress out (shorts and t-shirt) because I was embarrasses from the whelps on my body. The teacher of course did nothing because Dad was just following God's will to beat his children.  I didn't love my father again until I was 30 and finally called him on it and told him I was going to kick his ass. He begged my forgiveness and we cried and we healed our relationship and were close until his death.  I am so much happier as an atheist (from age 16) and really detest what otherwise seemingly rational people do in the name of religion and God.

My experience with people who say the "let's take this offline" is that they don't want other people to hear the answer - and so everyone gets a different answer. Or sometimes the answer is embarassing and the person getting grilled does not want to admit their fuckups in public.

&gt;Great, but you're not him.  Dude, I'm not the person who posted his life story and REQUESTED feedback. I'm the guy providing feedback by REQUEST. That you don't like my feedback, well, la-dee-fucking-dah. I'm entitled to my opinion.   The father is indirectly telling his kid to fuck off, and that means his father is a negative influence in his life. The kid isn't really a kid. He's a young adult and he tells us he can get by on his own for the three months. I say he should use the experience of having a shitty parent to his advantage -- take control of his life by getting the fuck out and providing for himself. No looking back.  The only question is how the son should handle his father years from now when the father is wracked with guilt at being such an asshole. That's assuming the father is still human enough to feel remorse.

You don't give birth alone even though in the end, it just come down to you and the baby. :) I've never been to counseling, but I think involving a professional before bailing would be a good idea.  If you weren't married yet I would advise against this guy.  But since you are already married and he seems like he is trying to improve (but just doesn't know/have a role model) give it a chance but not forever :)  I get the impression if this guy could improve you'd have a great 30+ years ahead.  But... you have been married from 22-25, and had a single boyfriend from 20-22.  Have you dated much before 20?  I get the undercurrent that you need more dating/life experiences before you really settle down...

&gt;Tim Davenport, 42, of Kansas City, Mo., was recently stopped on 15th Street in Blue Springs, Mo., and ticketed for going 40 mph in a 35-mph zone â although the police officer initially ticketed him for 40 in a 25, he says. "I drove down that road again, and the posted limit was 35," he says. "I figured the judge wouldn't accept that, since I was over the speed limit, and would still charge me with it. So I went ahead and paid" the $60 ticket. Doh!  That is *exactly* how judges let you off tickets.  All you have to do is disprove one major point on the report and you get off.  If the cop doesn't get the speed limit right how the hell can he claim he knew how fast you were going?  It destroys their credibility.  You will get off if they make this type of error 99% of the time.  
And I know why!

If people shout at you that you are a baby murderer, that is not endorsing violence.  If people send you threatening envelopes containing unidentified white powders, that's not endorsing violence.  If people throw a brick through your window and then leave messages on your answering machine about snipers, that's not endorsing violence.  If people send you threatening letters and the same day cut your gas lines, that's not endorsing violence.  "If Brown can't stop it, a Browning can" is not endorsing violence. "It is apparent that it will take a few assassinations to stop Obamacare. Militia central has selected you for assassination. If we cannot stalk and find you in Washington, D.C., we will get you in Little Rock." - that's not endorsing violence either.  Ramming someone's car because they have an Obama bumper sticker isn't endorsing violence.  Nor will anyone resort to violence simply because they believe the President is not American, a Muslim and a fascist communist tyrant who  wants to destroy the country, is raping lady liberty and wiping with the constitution as he builds up a corps of black stormtroopers and brainwashes the kids. That wouldn't inspire a violent reaction from anybody.  But none of that has ANYTHING to do with the tea party. The following quotes are just from random wingnuts, not anybody who has power or the ear of the movement:  "I want people in Minnesota armed and dangerousâ¦.having a revolution every now and then is a good thing." (Bachmann)  "If I could start a country with a bunch of people it would be the folks standing out here the last few days. Letâs hope we donât have to do that. Letâs beat that other side to a pulp. Letâs take them out, letâs chase them down..." (King)  "Thomas Jefferson said the Tree of Liberty will be fed by the blood of tyrants and patriots. You are the modern day patriots." (McCaul)  Remember, though, that even if anybody did (hypothetically) do something, it would be justified - as Newt Gingrich informs us, the democrats "Have To Take Some Moral Responsibility."

In a low percentage of cases nipples become less sensitive. Most women experience some numbness, but after a few months and sometimes even a year it comes back.  Back problems are an entirely different story. As long as you don't go too big you're not going to have back problems.
Just because someone is driving the speed limit, doesn't mean they are doing so in the *passing* lane.  It is not the "fast" lane, but the "passing" lane. It should be used as such.  I'm glad I make self important people mad :P

Right, but paying a handful of CEOs and Execs hundreds of millions, if not billions, in salary, stocks, and benefits is fine compared to hiring qualified workers (who have raised productivity ridiculously over the last 40 years) and paying fair wages and benefits.

Burgers can be healthy food too. Grind your own meat or buy from a butcher, but make sure it's lean meat. Buy darker bread without all the sugar in it - hamburger bread is like 50% sugar. Use lots of lettuce and onions and veggies, and maybe some balsamico dressing, again something low-fat.

Lol, good point. I'll blame that on talking about the 'politics' and specific seedy practices of some forms of Christianity; even as an atheist, I can usually conduct myself better than I did talking with you. I'll definitely use this experience as a reminder to keep the temper in check.  Thank you so for for the link, as well! That doesn't look like any organization I remember hearing about, but the fact that you have to pass that in for your contribution to be agreed with by the heads of that church proves that it is still going on even now. From what I have gathered, it used to be much more common with certain flavors of Christians and Mormons in years past; it looks like either the reports I remember hearing about, or cries from their congregations halted the practice in a lot of places. It looks like social control is used more now as opposed to tax records (Mormons will even stop you from attending a family wedding if you 'owe' them money), but they effectively lead to the same place.  Thanks again, I'm going to look more into the group from your link and see what I can find.

It would probably be worth looking at the receipt and papers that came with the couch, to see if the fabric was covered under warranty. If not, perhaps you can go to the local college/university/trade school  textile or design department. You could probably post a notice that you'd like someone to refurbish your couch if you'll buy the material. I'm sure plenty of students would have the opportunity to use that as a school project and they would do it for free. The cost of the fabric could cost you $30-$100 depending on what you want, and you'd get to pick exactly what you want. There are plenty of upholstery warehouses that have great quality fabric for cheap. Hope you find a good, cheap solution for your couch woes! p.s. or you could post on craigslist for the student option, I'm sure you'd get a few replies.

My grandfather was a non-religious man, though if you asked him, I suspect he would have said that he believed in God, as that's what respectable people of his generation did. But he never went to church, had no religious paraphernalia in his home, and looked askance at expressions of religious devotion (to a secular Canadian, it's like expressions of patriotism: it just seems crass).   At his funeral, the pastor (regardless of a man's life, there are some defaults it's difficult to avoid) recited what he called my grandfather's "favourite hymn," "How Great Thou Art," and spoke of it as illustrative of my grandfather's piety and devotion.  I was indignantly steaming: the man's name was Art, he was a perennial kidder, and he liked the hymn because it seemed to say that he was great.   I still feel indignant about the way the pastor misrepresented my grandfather for his own agenda.

I have to disagree.  there's no way executive's would kill their companies customers... and there's certainly no way the 'plebs' at consumer product companies would knowingly harm people.  Let alone the genius in R&amp;D knowingly do this.  so who is behind this?  I think the auto-manufacturers are a perfect example.  no one wants a front page story about accelerator problems as it will effect their brand, thus sales, thus the stockholders.  almost all of these stories is fear mongering and conspiracy in nature.   Edit: downvotes?  really?  It's like saying the 'world' is trying to kill you.  It's not, I work in the trade and it's all B.S.  consider me a soapier on steroids... it's just so false it pisses me off.

I am in full agreement but what worries me is exactly what you've said. Dems have done a horrible job in damage control and they need to tow along 'everyone else'. It's never about the truth it's about who sells it better.  Losing a few seats is expected but what makes me feel worse is that be succeeding in voting dems out it will reinforce the idea that their brand of 'truth' is correct and make that slide a little steeper.

He claimed to have "been all over". I actually have lived and visited quite a few locales and for every oddity he mentioned I could think of another place with it.  &gt; That's just like, your opinion man.  There haven't been race riots in the US in at least 20 years. They happened in the past couple years in paris. Most every continental european I've met has crazy stereotypes about every other type of european, and any other country/ethnic group. I have lived and still work internationally, this isn't anecdata. They're not quite as bad as say, the japanese.
i live in a pretty sketchy hood (constant sirens and cruisers everywhere, possibly due to gun shots, drug peddling, etc... a cop got beaten to within an inch of his life just down the street from my apartment last year :S). as a small, young, white female, i try to be wary of strangers late at night in the park. last night i got off the bus along with a 25ish-looking, slightly G'd up black man.  who greeted me with a warm smile, then introduced himself (seeming just plain and genuinely CHEERFUL the whole time). shook my hand. ("you live around here?" "yeh." "cool. maybe see you around sometime") told me to have a good night and walked off. no hint of creepiness. no hint of flirtation. no danger. not what i was getting ready to run away from in a desperate panic. just plain cheerfulness. i guess he'd just had a good day or something. 
Well, there's the line between being creepy and having mystique.  If your buddy drove a corvette and you asked to borrow it for the night, hoping to "be like him" it wouldn't work either - you'd awkwardly lean up against it trying to look cool and hope someone notices, which would look completely fake, where he would just drive his car like it was no big deal and not care if anyone notices. You can always work on improving yourself, but you're not going to find a magic set of rules to imitate, especially if you keep being down on yourself for not getting as many girls as your buddy or something.  Here's a starter - next time you see a girl you think is cute, walk up and say "Hey, can I ask you a quick question?  Where's a good place around here to have lunch?"  You don't need to marry this girl after you ask her, it just gets you more comfortable with having a casual conversation that can go in whatever direction you want.
While doing my teacher-education program in order to get my credential, we had a series of debates on this issue.  Most people's answer (these are the future teachers of America) was: "Let them read what they want so long as they're reading." It was face-palm for me every day of class for me.  I'm a bit of a traditionalist.  Yes, I want them to read, but I want them to GAIN something from their reading as well, so I don't want to just let them read whatever they want and say that's okay, especially when these kids today have been exposed to SO much media, that most of them can't effectively navigate it.  When I was in school, we were taught not only the classics, but how to deal with media bias and literacy.  We, on a whole (at least as I've observed and experienced) don't do that today - we ignore the media and say that the kids are so exposed to it throughout their lives now that they're better acquainted with it than we are, which I think is a bad way of looking at it.
I feel like you missed out. The last half of Palumpolum is where the game starts going, "Okay, you know the basics, now here are some mook teams that will kick your ass if you don't pay attention." The challenge kept me going until the story picked up again.
It all depends on context and your own physiology.  Generally, it would be better to eat a lot of sugar (read: not fructose) at once.  The Insulin spike that accompanies it would make metabolic changes to either use the sugar or reduce the bad effects of excess, but has other effects which aren't the best for overall health (like stopping the usage of fat for fuel, me no likey). Prolonging this exposure to Insulin over the course of the day would be the greater of two evils.  However, with the lesser of two evils, reactive hypoglycemia is still a concern.   And yes, Insulin before sleep is horrible. Sugars themselves aren't, but they are almost always followed by Insulin, which impairs many of the effects of GH, spiked highly during sleep.

Arrrgh. All this implementation-specific talk and cavalier treatment of terms. Per the standard, dereferencing NULL is undefined behaviour (not a crash), pointers are not actually integers, and a NULL pointer does not necessarily have all zero bits (assigning from/comparing to 0 is a special case, and it doesn't work with other integer values).  At least in C++, anyway.

To address the "preaching to the choir" complaints:  yes, I am aware of that (and did also put this in r/politics), but putting it where like-minded people congregate increases it's chances of other people passing it on to those who may not be as acutely aware of the issue or understand how deeply it's effects run.  Also, no harm ever came from having a well-known, popular (stop laughing) celebrity lend his weight to the cause.

I suppose "hard sciences" is a pretty vague term, but they enjoyed chemistry, math and other material covered in science and engineering courses. These two enjoyed chemistry and physics, so they ended up choosing Material Science as their degree. From my definition of hard sciences, I'd say that it's quite a large category. If you're versatile and enjoy a lot of things, I'd think that would make things easier on you if you *were* to go back to school and grab a different degree. The first year or so of most engineering/science/physics programs overlap quite a bit, and that is a great time to narrow down what you want to do. It's quite easy to bounce from physics to other disciplines if necessary, and you just might come across even more fields that you haven't yet considered. That's just a thought, though.

&gt; Apartheid? No. Apartheid is a single state, Israel and Palestine are clearly two states.  [Likud Party Platform](http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm)  &gt; The Jewish communities in Judea, Samaria and Gaza are the realization of Zionist values. Settlement of the land is a clear expression of the unassailable right of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel and constitutes an important asset in the defense of the vital interests of the State of Israel. The Likud will continue to strengthen and develop these communities and will prevent their uprooting.  And don't you go around declaring that Palestine is a state, cause Israel 'gwan kick yo ass!  &gt; A unilateral Palestinian declaration of the establishment of a Palestinian state will constitute a fundamental and substantive violation of the agreements with the State of Israel and the scuttling of the Oslo and Wye accords. The government will adopt immediate stringent measures in the event of such a declaration.  &gt; Colonialist?   Yes.  They're creating colonies (settlements) in what you just said is another state.  &gt; Did they invade and declare that land as their own.  Yes.  See above.  Golan was formally annexed, even.  &gt; or did they take the ground now known as Palestine in an act of defence against Invasion?  Israel invaded.   Egypt was acting bellicose, but Rabin subsequently admitted they could not have invaded.   Moshe Dayan [said](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/11/world/general-s-words-shed-a-new-light-on-the-golan.html?pagewanted=all) that Israel grabbed the Golan for the farmland after creating deliberate provocations on Syrian front.  &gt; Racist? Maybe. Hell, probably.  Yup.   They could avoid having their loved ones killed by getting the fuck out of their colonialist land grab.  Even Ehud Barak admitted he'd be a militant if here were a Palestinian.

They gain justification to continue the occupation and take further land. If there were no suicide bombers or attacks on Israel, Israel would have crumbled under the weight of international pressure and the exposure of the atrocities they have committed against the Palestinians. But because of the ability to provoke the Palestinians to violence, they can justify almost any act as self-defense. 
A lot of people on reddit downvote and upvote anything about Israel based on their view of Israel and it's not really about the article or the validity of anything said.
I agree with Foesi, a gas blow-back rifle will be as close as you can get to the real thing as a training device, without getting an m4 or ar15.  The problem with both the Inokatsu GBB, and the Systema is they are almost as expensive as the real rifle they replicate.  But they are both 1 to 1 replicas. If you need to sell the concept of an airsoft gun as a training device, try and get a GBB full metal pistol, and show your commander.  The internals of a Gas gun are remarkably similar to the real thing. Systema markets their airsoft guns as a PTW, or Personal Training Weapon.  While Inokastu just makes a point to make their guns as high quality as they can.

The entire point they were trying to make is since motion controls are "hip" now, more and more games are trying to shoehorn them into their game when they don't even belong.  Think of how many core Wii titles have motion control aspects when it provides nothing to the game. I sure as hell didn't need Twilight Princess to force me to waggle the controller every time I wanted to swing my sword. Smash Bros. Brawl having you execute smash attacks by wiggling the wiimote actually detracted from the rest of the controls (thank god they let you disable it and use a gamecube controller). In Super Mario Galaxy shaking the controller to spin was beyond pointless. I could go on, but you see where I'm going; each of those games had the controls detracted because instead of a simple button press you now had an inaccurate carpel tunnel inducing waggle.  Now to try and cash in on the same cow that Nintendo has, Microsoft and Sony are coming out with motion controls that do very similar things. My concern is that the publishers (in an effort to make more money) will pressure developers to put in motion control in games where they don't belong and the overall quality of games will decline with a mandatory irrelevant motion control aspect.  Sure, there are some games where motion controls work, and having an excuse to get up every now and again is fine. I worry when the quality of a game suffers from motion controls, and then publishers push to make them even more prevalent in gaming.

Going backwards timewise there would be a lot less people and they would be doing a lot less traveling.  Because of this there are probably plenty more places untouched by human feet than you'd normally think.  Just about any semi-remote area which hasn't previously been lush, full of needed materials or en route to such a place is certain to be full of them.
It'd be nice to have a look at the new layout. 
That would be one solution. Of course, the update is optional so long as you don't want or need to access the PSN. Perhaps they are more worried that the Other OS option is going to aid piracy. That would sort of make sense too since they are technically giving people the option to keep the feature by sacrificing online gaming and the PS Store. I'm willing to bet there is more behind this decision than we know.
Sanitarium and Longest Journey were really awesome, but Dreamfall is not a classic adventure and probably won't run on jactimetrics' laptop.

The hate is fully comprehensible in her case though..  I mean, she's probably feared for her life multiple times from Israeli soldiers and had family and friends die because of the conflict.  And then there's the blockade of needed goods for economic activity and any poverty she saw could be directly linked to Israelis.  Her whole life she has effectively been persecuted by Isreali Jews.  I imagine it's very hard to not grow up with fiery hate.  And most humans feel emotions first, then find the rationalizations for them.  The word 'sometimes' should clue you in that she doesn't always think like this.  If pressed, she would probably say that what Hitler was a terrible person and Jews shouldn't be put in ovens (but maybe only the Israelis).  But, I don't know her.

Hahaha, personal preferences? Have you ever actually read some of the regulations? Because lawyers like to stretch the wording of laws to the breaking point they tend to be stupidly specific and detailed. And yeah, a lot of the time situations require thought and can differ from case to case. That's why we have *judges* - when charged with breaking a regulation companies are free to appeal the decision, they do it all the time. It's also precisely why we will always need regulators - as things change regulations will have to change as well.

I'll bet that he and Widmore come to some reconciliation first, though.  I hope Ben lives. He hasn't had much of a life so far. What about Alpert? Does he get off the island?  I like Jack better this season, but I wouldn't go as far as luv.  I've seen The English Patient a number of times. de AlmÃ¡sy and Katharine immolated by the intensity of their passion is an appealing metaphor. And it's Ralph, but pronounced Rafe - why? I do not know. Naveen Andrews as Kip is *mmmm*.
Can you give an example of a situation where you think this would be the best solution?
We are a small company and do everything the grassroots way so you'll never see us shelling out Absolut and Jack money.   I also like Stoli - I 'think' they are one of the few big vodkas left who still properly distill their vodka rather than go through a 'distillation process'.  I wouldn't place our vodka in the same category as Stoli. We are a Sweet Tea Vodka - and we were the first. Our category is one of the fastest growing in the market and the big boys are trying to buy their way onto the shelves etc. However, Firefly is better.  We use pure tea, pure sweetener, pure vodka, pure water. We are made with real tea from the only tea plantation in the United States and we are made with Louisiana Cane sugar.

I agree.... why did this young boy have access to a shot gun.  I really believe that this kid should pay for what he did.  He took two lives, and took away the mom of a four year old.  I think severe psychiatric help is necessary and I do think he should be tried as an adult.  If tried as a juvenile, the courts can only keep him until he is 21, and they he is back on the streets.  I think another question we should be asking ourselves is why did this kid have the gun?  The story doesn't say it, but the gun was given to him as a gift by his father, which is illegal. The state of Pennsylvania has up to 5 years to bring charges against him; it will be interesting to see if they follow up on that
Too lazy.  The link I posted was the first one google gave me.
y++ is always executed, no?  EDIT:  Maybe you want this:    if(x == -1)  {    counts[y] = str;    y++;  }  The brackets are good for readability, so you don't forget which code is part of the if block, and which one is outside of it's "reach".

You are thinking of Star Wars Galaxies.  Blizzard was owned by Vivendi which merged with Activision.  That is how they got folded into Activision.  I don't know why this was allowed, Blizzard has always operated independently and made assloads of money for Vivendi.

There is one issue with this: Xbox Originals.  Microsoft sells Xbox 1 games on Live, and if its an online-focused game (i.e.: Crimson Skies, Conker), then you're selling a game that will be substantially limited right off the bat.  Crimson Skies is on the Originals list, as is Chaos Theory.  Chaos Theory is a full game, but Crimson Skies was definitely online-focused.
I don't get offended. To actually hear me talk... When I am online it's easy to believe something I have said is me taking offense, but typically I am A) trying to understand what someone is saying or B) using what they just said to help make a point. It takes a lot to make me angry. Like... No one has been able to make me properly offended in years. It just doesn't happen.
Some of my favorites. Some of which have been mentioned already.. oh well. Honestly I've probably played Tomba! and Tomba 2 ten times each.

Yes, yes it does, and string theory *does* assert that the universe is made of things that we can't prove exist. The thing is that both of these are much more complicated than that, and hold implications in our fields that are much more significant than these generalizations suggest.

If you like Flatland but wonder whether a more realistic two-dimensional universe could support a civilization, you might like [The Planiverse](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387989161?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=therpen-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0387989161) by A.K. Dewdney.  It's one of my favorite books, and it pays much attention to detail, including the biology, technology, culture, and physics that would allow a two-dimensional universe to work the way ours does.  It's a thought experiment taken to its extremes.

&gt;It's hard to find a mechanic to work on a 30 year old bike.  Really? I've never heard of people having that problem.
This is getting a bit annoying to try to explain this. The probability of almost everything !=0 and !=100. There might be a 1 in 100,000 (or some other high number) chance of getting raped in church in front of your mom. (Or maybe it's 1 because you live in Rwanda or something). The point is, while it's really close to 0 for practical purposes, it's never *actually* 0.  That said, most people understand that that probability means it is highly improbable for such a scenario to happen, and therefore it does not affect their behavior.  What matters is not whether a situation is *absolutely* safe-- it never is. The question is whether it is safe *enough*, and this  &gt;That is to say, still not 100% safe. But the odds are pretty good.  was referring to a situation where you are definitely safe *enough*. Now can we cut out the crap about how 'if you don't feel 100% safe in a [very safe situation], you must be paranoid'?
Yes. I basically am in that situation.

Whats interesting is how much higher premiums are on physical rather than they used to be as a percentage of the total.  Back in 2002 or so you used to be able to find premiums of $10 on $300 gold (3.3% premiums) on physical.  Now you regularly find $50 premiums on $1100 gold (4.5% premiums) physical.   Yet, through all this time, its still possible to buy paper-gold at spot (or below in many cases). Now, how would it be possible that the COMEX is able to continue to sell at spot, when their supposed physical inventory has such big premiums attached?   Its obvious that something is "not right" with the market. Look for the great disconnect to happen eventually. At some point, the "spot price" will *have* to stop being the London/NY paper market and become the real physical market. Its becoming increasingly clear that those "paper markets" are fantasies....a magical place where you can buy gold at 5% under the "real world".

In September 2008, I was late for class, waiting for an opening into the most popular parking lot on campus, and a line had formed out in traffic (which would get people fined, but they really wanted parking spots). There was some confusion between me and this really old guy with an awesome hat -- because of the way the line was forming, I was basically forced to cut him off. He looked really upset, and I felt horrible, so when we'd both gotten in and parked our cars, I went over and desperately apologized to him.  He just got the biggest smile and said, "Beautiful, you ain't gotta worry about a thing." Then he just straight up pulled me into him and kissed me on the forehead. He then said "And anyway, anyone who likes Obama is good people." (he'd seen my bumper sticker)  I was grinning like an idiot all the way to class. It was just too adorable.

Desmond hadn't meet Faraday in 1996 until after his flashes started.  Regardless of the requirement that the constant be someone who really matters to you, Faraday couldn't have helped unite Desmond's temporal history if he wasn't even a piece of it until after that history started unwinding.
I would not interfere, either, because he was bigger and stronger than she was, so I'd figure he could handle her if he had to.  If I did anything, it would be to tell him to "man up and don't take that shit from her, walk away and never see her again."  The fucked up thing is that if he did hit her in self defense, he'd be going to jail.  That's the fucked up part.

I call strawman.  The statement that "God is pure energy" is attributed to the imaginary scholastic?  The word energy has a physical, not a theological or philosophical meaning.
It does not seem to be easy to create an independent supportive group of the current government a la the Tea Party for the reason that it is said to be easier to destruct than to construct.   A supporting independent group would not be able to collectively agree with everything that the government has been doing and would have to have answers to all kinds of issues and would have a moving target on what the government has had to do and what the opposition has been throwing around... sh-t in the fan.  What does the Tea Party stand for? Primarily Tea Party members want a better economy and more jobs, but they also want all kinds of other things that may or may not have special interests behind them. Some may contradict each other and some may be impossible to implement without starting the country over.  My idea for starting the country over is to try to split it into hundreds of smaller countries or something... This way each small country could better tend to the people in it and people could know each other and trust each other and better prioritize policies... This would also make people more reliant on people from other "countries" so there was a greater sense of working with people from different cultures and stuff... :-)  Europe is a template for that, but Europe has got some big countries that could be split into smaller ones for instance. :-)  This way, the would could have tens of thousands of countries each could cultivate different cultures and some could teach God's words in schools and others could stick to evolution/Darwinism and no country would be too big to fail. :-)

Why are they mutually exclusive?  I wear tampons with pantyliners all the time.  Because sometimes, I have heavy flows when I don't expect it, and if I'm at work I don't want to ever have the situation where my underwear starts feeling moist because my tampon is now full. It's like using a condom while on birth control (assuming you are not at risk for STDs)--you don't *need* it, but it makes you feel safer.  (Yes, I know birth control is not 100%--neither is my pantyliner)
This is very true.  I think all men have a little doubt the first few years, because it's mainly the mother that interacts and we get stuck with the dirty diapers.   One big thing though is that moms have a tendency to make the child their #1, and this can be very bad (especially if you are feeling a little leery of being a father anyway).  Make sure that you both keep the priorities straight.  Also, this usually changes once Dad becomes the focus later on (3-4 years old and up).   One bit of advice, don't have more until you are sure it's right for you.  :)
I tricked NPR into saying Mike Rotch in one of their reports. I didn't think they'd fall for it, but my cousin who lives 300 miles away called me and said that he had definitely heard me on the radio.
Well, I'm gunna avoid going completely cliche on this, but it is true that you have no chance with an attractive girl *if* that's your approach to approaching them. Why would a pretty girl you don't talk to have the ability to hurt you? You haven't gotten maced before, have you?  Hit on the girl in the library if she's the one you find attractive. Not because you expect her to be easy. You look at her that way and I assure you she won't be anyways.  Attitude is everything.

A side note on this quote: I was driving back from Lake Havasu where me and a bunch of friends went for spring break. I cop pulled me over for speeding and made me step out of the car. Apparently I was acting shifty to him, because he kept asking me why I was nervous (I've never gotten pulled over before, that's why!). Keep in mind that I was stone sober at the time, had nothing in my car that was illegal, and we were standing on blacktop in the middle of the AZ desert. That's when he asked me,"do you mind if I look around your car?"  This song was popular at the time, and was really the only reason I knew that I could say no. He told me to have a nice day and that was it.  TL;DR: This lyric saved me from an unnecessary police search.

Like almost all games and toys, what makes Lego childish is that it signals a self-centred fascination with idle amusements.  I admit I have my Nintendo DS in my lap as I write this.  Yet I play down the amount of games I really have played over the years to others.  Because I don't want them to know I've frittered away weeks if not months of my life playing RPGs, RTS and FPS when I could've been doing something with other human beings.  It is selfish.  That's why it's childish.  Because children are selfish and adults are supposed to understand that.

&gt; If by object-extentions you mean things Objective-C and C++  No, these are languages. There are object-extensions that can be used with a plain C compiler.  &gt; pretty much all Mac OS X applications ... in Objective C  Which is not true. All the FreeBSD and Mach stuff is not written in Objective-C. Many software just uses an adapter to Objective-C, but runs much of their stuff in their own language or in just plain C. I just got a new version of EyeTV and I'm pretty sure that their new 64bit MPEG2 decoder is not written in Objective-C. For much stuff just the UI parts are written in Objective C.  &gt; Object-based programming (cleanly combine class-based and prototype-based programming â best of both worlds with none of the bad parts) Predicate dispatching Pattern dispatching Mirror-based reflection (capability-based security with reflection) Per-object mixins The Agora programming language (the only language to really get encapsulation right â "The Scheme of Object-oriented Programming") Nested mixin-methods (the perfect way to handle inheritance in my opinion) Lexical inheritance Computed object-literals (eschew lambda and closures for something more general) Objects without global scope as first-class parametric modules (making ML modules look shoddy and dated) Subjective-programming (utilising context-sensitive behaviour) Seamlessly distributed object-oriented languages like Obliq Pattern-matching which respects encapsulation Specialisation interfaces (the possibility of optional type-inference for most any object-oriented language, even the dynamic ones). The integration of Actors and Objects, so programmers can easily write programs in ad-hoc network environments. ...  Wait, wait. Weren't we talking about mind-blowing recent stuff?  Agora and Obliq have been abandoned more than a decade ago, haven't they?. I have never seen any useful software written in it. Stuff like Predicate Dispatch is also more than a decade old and I'm pretty sure it existed before that somewhere in the Prolog community.  Is there anything really exciting new in the OO world that is of practical use? Used by somebody?  CLOS was developed with the MOP from the start. It's just that the MOP part hasn't been standardized by ANSI. The MOP part is the ground breaking part. At least Alan Kay thought that the AMOP book was important, though unfortunately for him, using Lisp.
