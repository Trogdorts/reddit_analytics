Focus on yourself, for me when Ive been single I started going to college to advance my career. So, focus on your career, your social life, your hobby/hobbies, or do something positive you never thought you would, use this time to improve yourself.  Also realize there are 8 or so billion people in the world, if you put yourself out there and learn to handle rejection better you'll find someone.

I immediately took that to mean that Madeleine was spirited and not likely to just go along complacently with her kidnappers and make it easy for them.  That she‚Äôd kick and scream and struggle.  Which may have been what she did, and they decided she was more trouble than she was worth.

Hang in there. My sister is an addict who used my parents so badly. She lived there when she wasn't using and did absolutely nothing for most of the time she was there. I know she was using small amounts of heroin while there but i never could press the issue with my parents as they were happy to know where she was. I hope that you find her and help her but don't enable her as they did for so many years. Insist that she stay clean and don't coddle her. Tough love.  I should mention that my sister has been using hardcore drugs for 34 years , starting with crack and progressing to heroin, before that, in high school she was always high on something or another so really she has been doing them for nearly 40 years (she will be 54 this year).

**Formatting** - Don't sweat it too much. It's not so much that there's right or wrong formatting, just *appropriate* or *weird* formatting. Read a lot of scripts and it'll become obvious.  **Introducing Maggie** - I think it'd be cool to meet her at the party. A great way to signal that a character is important without being hamfisted is using the camera to introduce them. Start the scene where they're smoking a joint with a shot centered on Maggie. Have a close up on her face and pull back as Noel and Jamie talk about lighting the joint. It'll immediately tell us that we're supposed to be seeing things through Maggie's POV rather than Noel or Jamie. That's a great place to show-off her *"I'm new to this"* character as well, have her fumble passing the joint because she starts coughing or something.   You should think of each scene as a scarce resource, so pack it full of characterization, conflict, or plot.   PS - And of course I meant it! But you've got to keep revising or it'll never be true.

&gt; So you are saying that every object you put on the score you don't have to tweak the position at all? You never have to adjust things for spacing or because of collisions as the software automatically moves everything around every time you do something?  The first version I bought was '09 and it was terrible. Always had to go in and nudge things. I upgraded to '13 and it was significantly better, but still with some flaws. Since upgrading to v.25 I can't remember having an issue that wasn't caused by my own stupidity. I'm not going to claim that it *never* makes a mistake, but I don't think that Dorico should claim that their algorithm is perfect either. I'm pretty sure I could come up with something arcane that would trip it up, there's just so many things you can decide to notate.

No offense, but everybody would be depressed if their days looked like this. If this is you, I think you have to be honest and ask yourself is your depression the reason why your days are like this or is it vice versa. Doctors told me I have a chronic depression. Throughout the years I changed my diet. Exercise one in a while, drink two cups of coffee. Socialise, try to. Reach out when feeling depressed. And for the love of God, stop watching porn for a couple of months. Your brain needs to heal, it's hijacked by this constant influx of non natural dopamine.   It does get easier. I am very tired so there isn't as much detail in my comment as I would like to but please message me if you want to talk or ask me anything. I am not trying to be jerk, but I would hate to see somebody go down those lonely years as I have.

You build confidence, and for me confidence is knowing who you are and what you're capable to do, it's like knowing your cards in different fields and domains, it has alot to do with exploring yourself, try New things you havent tried yet ( even the things you think you're bad at ) it takes alot of time, it's like growing up, and embrace your weaknesses, identify and accept them in order to get them out of your every day focus or to work on them and nutrelize them.

Artists are eccentric and own a lot of weird shit sometimes. He owned a lot of art books of nude men and women as well, and these were obviously part of a general collection. These books were not found in the context of an excessive collection of nude photographs of children, but they were found in the book collection of a man who was generally interested in photography, art photography, art history, book rarities and vintage books and not specifically focused on nude photographs of children. At least two of the books could be assumed to have been gifts from a fan as well since one was inscribed as such and the other one was the sequel to the inscribed one. Even if that wasn't the case and he bought the books himself what are the chances that he was such a dastard and devious pedophile that he purchased three books and didn't bother to procure any other nude photos of children?   Besides, the evidence submission request that lists these books was endorsed months after the judge had barred all evidence from the 1993 investigation, which dramatically damaged the prosecution's case. They pushed to reverse this ruling with documents such as the one you provided, and eventually won a minor victory; three books were permitted, as was testimony about five alleged victims and the pornography. But that's it; nothing else made it.   I'm sure you are aware of all of this though since your other posts indicate that you know the cases and allegations quite well and has researched them, something i'm incredibly thankful for since most people talking about this issue have not (which makes it hard to have any sort of discussion). So i just wanted to commend you for that.   Can i ask, where do you get your claim that the books were found in a "locked filing cabinet", i can't seem to recall where that information is from?

Awakening makes it really easy to grind levels outside of chapters. Most games have a limited amount of experience, so you're better off with an elite team to carry the lord. If you're trying to use too many units, try funneling that experience into fewer strong units. Typically, the knights get left behind as soon as possible for being too slow, and and some people go as narrow as one unit per promotion item + mages.   Additionally, people argue about when the right time for promotions should happen.  Do you promote your troubadour at lvl 10 or not? And do you stop for arena grinding?   Also, even though Binding Blade comes before Blazing Blade, maybe try Sacred Stones and Blazing Blade before you try more of the games. They're considered easier and make a better transition from Awakening to the different tactics of the older games.   I can't speak for Tellius games, but, I've seen people struggle with those for RNG.

&gt;Ahh, here we are: the utterly unjustified opinion that you‚Äôd end up with proportional representation in a particular area (eg a sufficiently large corporation‚Äôs employees should race/sex/other characteristic match some populace) *absent discrimination*.   Who said that?   &gt;There‚Äôs this bizarre idea on the left that differences of outcome are due to to discrimination (which you redefine as the lack of opportunity). There is nothing in life to suggest such a thing.  Why would you think such a thing?  I doubt you‚Äôve even thought about it.   It's not a left/ right thing - the scientific evidence shows that discrimination affects the ratio.  I'm on the right and even I accept that.

I have to say im a minivan owner and I like the vehicle especially caravan with flip and fold.  All the same this folding comes out of honda or toyota who started it with the rear seat and I would love a shorter vehicle with the same seat height (if you are injured or infirm minivan seats are the best.  Do not have to fall into them or climb up into them) but just the back row that flips down but yeah sliding doors and all that.  It would be great.  Lower price, better mileage, same convenience and just a bit less cargo capacity.

You guys are all wasting your time with your *rally* shit. The game is over, the analytics team already packed it up and determined it a loss.
I have some suggestions:  * Please remove d6s, they clutter up the tables and sometimes I roll badly. Please replace dice with a CCG - style conflict resolution system where I can spend money on "high-cards" to make my character better; * Sometimes I play with other people that just don't care enough about their character. Can you please introduce micro-transaction PDFs that require: * Players to buy races. Want to play a Troll? That's a 0.99c PDF on the store; Need a Smartlink? That's only 0.49c; * Do similar things for ammo. I'm sick of people handwaving the rules. Have official ammunition punch cards that must be purchased in order to fire your weapons; * Have a spot on each of the cards that clearly show what character/campaign they are for. We don't want people reusing them, that goes against the capitalist nature of the game! You want to be good, pay for it!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;

The team isn't just stacked with home grown talent. It's basically all home grown talent. Every one dressed for the game yesterday excluding, Gudas, Knight, Varone, Voracek, Talbot, all started their career with the Flyers. JVR is the odd ball of that group as literally every other player on the roster for the game against Carolina has only played for the Flyers. The Flyers aren't just stacked with home grown talent, it's spilling over the top.  The Flyers have so much great home grown talent, "fans" are willing to give up on Provy, Ghost, TK and other to sell them off for picks or a true #1 guy at whatever position. The one thing that is missing from this group is a Stanley Cup quality coach. All the other bases are covered. I'm not taking away what Gordon has done in the short term. He inherited a team that was ripe with young kids they just needed to knock off the old stock. And I know..." One more year and the Flyers are cup ready". It's cliche but I believe they are right there. A Stanley Cup quality coach like Coach Q pushes what the team already has over the limit.   The young talent is there and more are coming up to take spots.

Let's have a look at the timeline of this comment chain.   &amp;#x200B;  \- OP's post is about political posts being locked.  &amp;#x200B;  \- I ask why political posts are locked and not removed.   &amp;#x200B;  \- Someone responds saying that most of the time the posts aren't political, they're just pictures of Trump with a meme caption.   &amp;#x200B;  \- I respond by saying that Trump is an an incredibly divisive political figure, and so even just memes of him are inherently very political and divisive, making the space more toxic and political.   &amp;#x200B;  \- You respond by saying that Trump is not divisive in most of the US, and go through talking points about the progress he has been making.   &amp;#x200B;  \- I try to get across the point that this sub is not just Americans, and even for Americans, he has a less than 50% approval rating, with likely half that outside the US.  Again emphasizing not that I dislike Trump, but that he is divisive, which was my main original point.  &amp;#x200B;  \- You respond by comparing his US approval rating to Obama's (I have no idea why), and go on to continue pro Trump and anti Obama talking points.  &amp;#x200B;  Are you aware that you're posting on a warhammer meme sub? This is some weird ass shit.

Being upfront about this I honestly have no clue what the A.I  Does half the time. I usually can roll and be ok for a bit, but, largely, I have noticed that they like to run down to you take cover, then get up, and shoot.  It's fucking dumb.   Also, armor in this game is sort of wonky, I really feel like armor was added so that we can tank a few bullets but, Challenging enemies really do a number there, damage resistance is just silly at this point. Building tanky does literally fuck all, and the ballistic shield is not tied to your health under a gearset now, so, there goes that.   I am sort of out of sorts with veteran enemies, purples are more dangerous than elites and named enemies sometimes, and it shows. They hit hard, not as hard, but, they are spongy, and I really feel like they either need to just have less armor as a result or more health and no armor. They are just in the middle ground where it just does not seem to be easy to deal with them like before. Elites really arent the issue come to mind, and I would actually love to see more golds and less purples in missions. Reds are fodder lets be honest.  I think ALL WEAPONS should get an inherent damage to armor stat. Lower caliber, less damage to armor, but increase stat to another. So an SMG could get 25 percent crit chance (just an example) and  10 percent armor damage to enemies. Assault rifles could get 25 percent damage to health with varying amounts of armor damage, say 15-20.  &amp;#x200B;  I wanna see what happens in tidal basin and se where the game goes before this stuff comes back up again but, i do think we need to see world tier 5. Once we get that done and out of the way, we should suggest this stuff. Hofully see some tweaks

Also, the Leclerc situation is much different from 9th - 11th my dude. He was like 10 laps away from his first grand prix win in F1, ever. That's a massive deal! Yeah he's in a Ferrari and hopefully he's up there more, but remember Bottas didn't even win a single race last year with Mercedes who won the constructors championship by quite a margin. It's not a given. Winning a race is huge, and having it ripped away at the last moment is incredibly disappointing.

Technically correct, however what I was referring to is a case specific to the grammar found in the original sentence. I admit my comment was vaguely stated. OP made redundant usage of the word ‚Äúwith.‚Äù ‚Äú**with** which to browse memes **with**.‚Äù Only one ‚Äúwith‚Äù is necessary, and can be used in either place.

Looking at it that way is just as good. 
In addition to the other answers:  Mp3 compression takes advantage of a psychoacoustic effect known as frequency masking.   When two frequencies that are close together are played quickly one after the other with the first being 10dB louder than the second one, you don‚Äôt actually perceive the second one.   Mp3 compression uses this to actually remove frequency data permanently, this is why it is known as a lossy compression format. You actually lose data.   It does start doing something called aliasing, which is really audible on low quality Mp3s. If you listen to the high frequency information, like hihats, on an mp3 it sounds mushy and ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù.   MP3s are also band limited above a certain frequency, often around 15,000Hz, which means *all* the data above that frequency is completed removed.   Most people can‚Äôt actually tell the difference between a 320kbps Mp3 and a 24-bit 48kHz PCM wave file, and the wave file will be about 10 times bigger. 10 times longer to download, 10 times longer to stream. So, for the most part, uncompressed audio isn‚Äôt the preferred delivery format for consumer level  digital audio.   Now that transmission bandwidths aren‚Äôt as important as they used to be due to faster internet speeds, lossless formats like FLAC are becoming more and more popular.

Max Martin's name doesn't guarantee a hit the way it used to. He's produced tons of songs that never even charted and whatever he theoretically makes for this girl would probably befall a similar fate, because she's simply not that interesting.  Also, it doesn't just take one hit to make someone "mainstream", the way the OP is describing it. Even if Sabrina Carpenter was featured on some big EDM DJ's US hit, she'd just be "the girl who sang that one song", not "Sabrina Carpenter, known artist". Look at ROZES, Foxes and Daya for examples of this.

My condolences on the death of your dad.   Has he ever had any counseling? The loss of your dad compounded with your mom is hard to deal with.   And he also may be having a lot of anxiety with leaving high school. I teach high school and see it a lot with seniors reaching the end of their last year, everything familiar is changing and it can overwhelm some of them. Talk to him, brother to brother, and see if this may be part of what is going on. Share a bit of how you got through it and emphasize that it is an important step he needs to take in his future.

It's not subtle.  It's damage control.  There is no plan, nothing's genius, and I think you're talking out ass.  You come in here saying things are calculated and not only do you have no idea what is being done, but you're projecting a structured story on what has been a series of bad social media moves.  
You're able to post on Reddit because people who don't want to work that much go to work and make the servers that handle your post request work, electricians that follow electrical engineers' blueprints and fix and create wirings, who all don't want to work, work. The list goes on and on, you fill a role that needs to be filled, you put something into the system and you get currency to make others work for you.  This really isn't that hard. This is a system fine tuned and working for over 500 years now, maybe the generation before us didn't do it that well but that's a meaningless notion, seeing as our generation is ready to not put effort to keep it going for the next generation.

Those cases of females being the perpetrators of violence is almost exclusively related to domestic issues. Sadly, yes, these cares are often trivialized. I'm more so referring to women who go out of their way to assault or harass men just because they hate them. This is not a very common occurrence. Most misandrists will just bitch about men on tumblr and call it a day.

I had pretty severe trust issues and was emotional manipulative. The way my ex described it was there was a good and bad me. When I was good I was really sweet and caring, when I was bad i would be verbally abusive and controlling. I finally got professional help, I opened up and starting talking about my past and my feeling and let my guards down. Losing my ex was a major wake up call for me. I promised myself I would never act like that again and be kind to everyone always. I don‚Äôt let my emotions get the best of me and I never take it out on someone else.

Okay, it's not in the blog. Thanks for this! Find it weird the nights were called "puzzles" and Mangle was called a "rat" but okay.

They're most likely gonna cut off a lot of the nights. Wonder how that would work for the story.

The Vita has actually a pretty nice hardware for the time, 512MB RAM (Same as a PS3, but shared with the GPU), 128MB of video RAM, the GPU is a Quad-core PowerVR SGX543MP4+, the same GPU used in the iPad 2 but a bit more powerful, the CPU is a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore, the same CPU design was used one the iPhone 4S and iPad 2 but it was a dual core, not a quad-core, pretty efficient design for the day and also pretty powerful, actually it was  a bit more powerful than smartphones from the day so it wasn't bad at all, a shame it didn't sell well.

If you're just now figuring out that this is war, you're coming late to the party. WAKE UP! The contest between Islam and human civilization has been ongoing for more than 1400 years. What do we do? Ten of the THOUSANDS of possible things to do follow below:  1. If you don't already know how to pray, **LEARN and practice daily prayer** for yourself, your loved ones, for our Beloved President, for our uniformed Guardians (military &amp; civilian) for our leaders, for our teachers and for the coming Kingdom of God. Yes, I'm serious. Pray as if it's all up to God and WORK for His Kingdom as if it's all up to us. You wanted to know - I'm telling you. 2. **READ and study the Only Holy Word of the Only Living God: The Bible**. PRAY over what you will read. ASK for wisdom. READ the Bible and then PRAY over what you have read. Make friends with people of Christianity or of Judaism - or BOTH. TALK with them about Heavenly matters and the reality of God's active Grace in this world. Be BUSY about being a part of God's Reconciliation of this busted-ass world. Seek FIRST God's Kingdom and His reconciliation (His righteousness). LEARN to listen to the Holy Spirit of God in your heart. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! 3. **FIND and attend and support a Church or Synagogue** that you can *fully* support. GET SERIOUS about supporting (with your MONEY and your time) one or both of the only two Abrahamic faiths that exist: Judaism and Christianity. God in Christ is our ONLY hope. The Churches and the Synagogues - no matter HOW imperfect they are - are the entities through which the Heavenly Father has worked in the past. YES, the Churches are all full of hypocrites (I don't really know about Synagogues). When you participate, you'll realize you're just one more. You'll be right at home. 4. **WHEN YOU ARE** ***STRONG*** **IN THE FAITH In Christ - LEARN &amp; TEACH** about Islam. Yes, I'm sorry that ANYONE has to learn anything about Islam. However - we ***ARE*** at war. You're gonna need to know ALL YOU CAN LEARN about your enemy: the filthy, vile, violent and hate-filled idolatry of the pseudo-prophet of Islam. Islam is NOT an "Abrahamic Faith"! Islam is an idolatrous institutionalization of supremacism, misogyny &amp; **SIN** \["you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy"\] (but yes, worse than Mos Eisely space-port). There are AMPLE resources on the web and through your local library to help you come up to speed. **WARNING**: **Islam is spiritual** ***POISON***. Become strong in the force of the Holy Spirit of God before you dig deep into Islam. DO NOT WALK THIS PATH ALONE! David Wood (Acts 17 Apologetics), Pamela Geller (Geller Report), Robert Spencer (Jihadwatch) and DOZENS more will help get you started - but find a MENTOR to help keep you safe while you learn. REMEMBER: **THE NAME OF THE ONLY LIVING GOD IS** ***NOT*** **"Allah"** and there is **ONLY ONE LIVING GOD (the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ). Muslims DO NOT worship the Only Living God!** Remember, Islam has NOTHING to do with Father Abraham. The Muslim people are NOT spiritual descendants of Ishmael. The pitiful Muslim people are slaves. Islam is more military-political than it is religion. Any imagined connection between Islam and Father Abraham is (to quote a great man) "ridiculous bullshit". 5. **THIS IS SPIRITUAL WAR** \- every bit as much as it is social and cultural war. When our Churches and Synagogues are strong and well-supported, when our civic leaders are clear about the rule-of-law, when our social organizations are well-informed regarding the realities of Islam, when our media organizations no longer support the destruction of our Constitution, THEN, Islam will have less chance to spread unopposed and stealthily. GIVE ISLAM NO QUARTER. **SUNLIGHT IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT!** Major, ***MAJOR*** money (petro-dollars) has gone into corrupting our public officials. Vote for and support people who love our way of life. EXPOSE AND REJECT those who would - or who do - sell out to the enemies of freedom. 6. **ORGANIZE with local officials, spiritual leaders and other like-minded people**. Yes, I KNOW you don't have time but, President Trump CANNOT do all of this by himself. And, remember? THIS IS WAR! THIS IS FOR ALL THE MARBLES! Organize to EXPOSE examples of the implementation of SHARIA - in the media, in legislation, in business, in banking, in education, WHEREVER! CALL IT OUT! NAME IT FOR WHAT IT IS! **SHARIA IS DEATH!** SHARIA is the END of human freedom. THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY in SHARIA! There MUST BE NO SHARIA in Democracy. We must EXPOSE AND LOUDLY REJECT every manifestation of "the path" of the pseudo-prophet and his slaves. 7. **Understand that there is no reform in Islam**. All of Islam is Mohammad's Islam or it's NOT Islam. ISIS is the perfect demonstration of the reality of Islam. ISIS IS WHAT IT MEANS TO LIVE UNDER ISLAM!! Understand that Mohammad's Islam is worse than the WORST of la Cosa Nostra. Islam is like a gang; like a cult - but much WORSE! Escape from Islam is VERY difficult and very dangerous. Most of the pitiful wretches who live under Islam have been born into it and leaving Islam is as much spiritual/psychological as it is physical. 8. **BE PREPARED TO DEFEND YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVED ONES FROM VIOLENCE!** You have no need to inflict violence onto others but YOU - as a defender against Islam and as an educator regarding Islam's deadliness - MUST NOT TOLERATE threats or attacks against you or your family. Keep dash-cams looking forward and backward on your vehicles. Record all phone conversations. KNOW where your children are going and KNOW the people with whom they'll be spending time. Stay informed regarding local mosques and their leaders. Who is teaching terror? Who is advocating violence? Remember? THIS IS WAR! If your profile becomes high enough - if you become an important enough target, you may be threatened. BE READY TO EXPOSE the PERPETRATORS or to defend yourself in any way necessary. DO NOT be a victim! Again, you need people around you who understand the threat! Again, seek out a mentor and ORGANIZE your community of "counter-jihadists". Get to know your local L.E.O.'s and collaborate with them when possible. 9. **When you become mature enough** and your community is organized enough, you MAY be able to help Muslims escape Islam. THIS IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS and is NOT for newbies. SEVERAL layers of organization are necessary and you'll need the cooperation of your L.E.O.'s, of your spiritual leaders and of one or more social service orgs. What I'm saying is, we must deplete their number and turn as many of the Muslim people into true patriots and true worshipers of God in Christ. IT AIN'T EASY! However, we MUST transform our enemies into our friends and then ENLIST their aid to help more Muslims escape from Islam. WARNING!!!! Muslims are taught to lie to protect Islam (and the Ummah) from childhood. You need discerning friends and a true spirit of discernment before you take this path! 10. **DO NOT STOP PRAYING! DO NOT STOP WORKING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND FOR HIS RECONCILIATION! UPLIFT THE FALLEN! STRENGTHEN THE FAINT OF HEART! WATCH FOR WHAT GOD IS DOING AND THEN FOLLOW HIS LEAD!**  I wish you well!

My '02 pence worth' go with at least 125cc , and a known brand, 02nd hand is fine IF the scooter is 'healthy'. A 50cc scooter does not have the carry space a larger machine would, and a 50cc in any traffic, with its slow speeds, means the 'bangers and mash' will arrive semi frozen. And a 125cc means that you, in busy traffic, have the power to avoid problems.

I used to be *very* intimidated by the idea of going to a gym. I had no idea what to do, how to use the machines, where to start. I was so lost but I really wanted to get healthy and look good.  So, what I did and what I recommend to everyone in this situation was look for group fitness classes.  When I started going to group fitness classes, I stayed in the back behind everyone so no one could see me mess up. They should offer you all the equipment you‚Äôll need (mats, weights, barbells, etc.) and the instructor should explain all the moves, reps and sets. If they don‚Äôt give clear demonstrations, just watch the people in front of you and copy them.  After a few classes, I started feeling really good and confident! I can go into the gym whenever i‚Äôm stressed out and knock out some moves I‚Äôve learned from these classes and I even make up some moves on the spot for extra burn. I feel better than i‚Äôve ever felt and I hope this is helpful for you too

Nah, it actually did originate on the left as a critique of cynical insincere gestures towards social justice for the sake of advancing oneself, often used in reference to corporations and shitty centrist politicians. Rainbow capitalism and pinkwashing are just two of many examples of this, see also politicians who‚Äôll say they support Muslims while bombing the crap out of the Middle East.  The right consumed it a while later, unfortunately. But it was a useful phrase before that.

My SO was in a similar situation a couple of years ago where BM drove drunk with the kids in tow and ended up in a ditch with the engine being ejected. She has a felony now and he has full custody.  Advise your friend to get a lawyer and take it to family court. This could have actually ended up a lot worse than it did.

I'm flatting so rent for me is 185pw, power can be up to 60 a month, water 15 a month, internet 33 a month. Food is what you make of it I suppose but for a single person 100ish pw should about cover it if you're cooking all your meals and what not (lord knows I should). Overall I get by with an income of around 500 a week, it's not much but it pays the bills and allows me to have a little bit of spending money.

I've told this before but that time I fucked a girl for gas money, and a laptop to piss off her dad and mom when I was 19. Basically I was everything her white collar lawyer father hated and she wanted to piss him off, so she bought me a macbook air and a couple collared shirts and a nice pair of pants. In return I was to take her out on a date in my shitty two color truck and sneak into her house for late night sex. Win for me because I got the better end of that deal.

The Resident Evil 1 remake is one of my favorite games. I think it's definitely worth playing, but there are some caveats.   You're right, the version on PS4 is a remaster of a remake. The remaster made it look a little nicer and added new control options that the Gamecube didn't have. In my opinion, you can skip the original RE1 on the PSX. The remake basically takes everything from the original, expands the story and gameplay, and makes it look beautiful and atmospheric. In comparison, original RE1 is going to feel very dated and wooden.   One thing to keep in mind if you play the Remaster is that it's essentially a game from 2002. That's not necessarily a bad thing. In 2002, Capcom was coming off of 4+ classic survival horror games. In my opinion, REmake was the pinnacle of that style, which doesn't exist anymore. Back then, horror meant lots of inventory management, tank controls, limited ammunition, etc. I think it's still perfectly playable in 2019, but you have to cut it some slack for being less user-friendly than modern games.   After you play the Remaster, you can actually track down a copy of the original Resident Evil 2 on PSX. Unlike the 1-Remake relationship, the RE2 remake changes a lot from the original. It's still worth playing the original RE2 so you can appreciate the remake that much more. There are still some cool things in the PSX version that the new version didn't cover.   If you buy the RE1 HD remaster on disc, it comes with a remaster of Resident Evil 0, which was also released on the Gamecube in 2002. RE0 is a lot more divisive, for both story reasons and gameplay considerations. It's a lot harder, more frustrating, and less tightly designed than Remake. It's worth playing if you fell in love with Remake. But if you weren't crazy about it, then skip it.

Can confirm that Stony Brook does not ‚Äúred-line‚Äù or give you multiple chances with a singular course. Some schools will allow you to do this once or twice basically overwriting your grade but here you keep the grade and it just adds another grade to your GPA but not credit totals.

For clarity, this "fuel levy" is part of the federal carbon pricing program that was a backstop for provinces that did not make their own plan.  Also, the Ontario PCs have introduced a new carbon plan they hope to get in place this summer. Similar to the federal program but with lower cost for business (at least that is what they pitched).  All in all, its been an annoying 2 years jumping from program to program.   - The environmental guy from an ontario business.

I think you need to ask yourself - and yes it is absolutely the worst - whether or not you actually want conditional love and affection that is only given in return for living in a box. I don't know how old you are but it's also important to not rely on them to give you that sense of security and support because the reality of this religion, is that Islam, and Mohammed come first, regardless of how great a person you might be.   And I am truly sorry, I really am. This sub exists for a reason, we are here to support each other (mostly), and surrounding yourself with people who celebrate you is more important than suffering for those who stifle you.

It's a tough call. If you can wait, likely the C7Z's (used or even new) are going to drop quite a bit. Corvetteforum won't like to hear it, but they will. Just look at normal pricing curves on all of them. The only way I don't see it happening too much is if the C8 is a total disaster (and that is a possibility). If you're not that crazy about the potential of the new C8 platform (or don't care), then you're heading right into prime C7Z snagging opportunity.   However, none of us have infinite time here so there is absolutely something to be said about having the car you love one summer sooner and getting the enjoyment out of it. We never know what will happen. Generally speaking, none of these cars will be worth more after we've used them (unless you're talking put 10k miles on it, winterize it, throw it in storage for 40+ years and pray) and there will ALWAYS be someone faster, something newer, whatever. Get what you love and go enjoy it.   edit: and to clarify, when I say "no chance in hell I'm paying 70k" that is simply because I have so much overlap in my current lineup already that I can't sink 70k into something that pretty directly competes with half my garage. On their own, I still firmly believe the looks, performance, and improvements of the C7 are hard to beat in that price range.

Unlikely. It requires specialized tools and it's easy for you to damage your mechanism even taking it out or putting it back in...   Please hire a pianotechnician aka pianotuner, for the tech it's an easy fix.   Also tell the tech u took the mechanism out, so (s)he can be sure it is put back properly.

When I was 12 or 13, I had a dream that I was having sex with the girl down the street who was the same age as me. I was going down on her when I looked at her vagina and her clit started wiggling and ringing like a bell. I realized in the dream that it was actually my alarm in real life going off.  The worst part is I kept a dream journal at the time and wrote that one down. My mom found the journal and lost her mind. I had to spend like 15  minutes explaining what the journal was. At the end of my explanation, it was clear she still wanted to yell at me for something but she didn't know how to yell at me or what to yell at me about.

you started with 15 - 15 (5.5) -&gt; switched to the 14 medium so -  First replication after switch in medium - 15 - 14 (5.45) Second replication after switch in medium  - 15-14 (5.45) and 14-14 (5.4)  Does that make sense? You are saying you understand replication is semi conservative but you're not applying it to the problem.

Also 5 seeds have to play the 1 seed before the 2, so if they beat the 1 already, they have a good shot against the 2.
1. Modern gamers buy call of duty like crack addicts. I'm not concerned with what they think is a "masterpiece". This era will end someday, mores will changes, and history will sort out what a masterpiece is, not a generation of consumerist idiots who fight "console wars".  2. As I stated, the core of the game must be good first. Your examples ALL have great central gameplay mechanic cores. If they didn't, no one would talk about them now. If they didn't have great thematic layers, they'd still be great games because of that central core. Just harder to brand.
No one has been able to replicate the way you shoot a gun in Destiny. No one. Yes, things have changed. If Borderlands 3 can improve on its formula I think it will be fine.   I do agree with you on the MMO-Lite comment. But how awesome would it be if BL3 turned out like that? Awesome bosses, a stead stream of content?  &amp;#x200B;  I just dont want the game to turn out like Duke Nukem. People have been waiting for BL3 since they finished BL2. The fanbase has changed. Hopefully the the franchise doesnt rest on its laurels and invigorates the franchise.

Your professor may be teaching you a different method (I'm in Calc 3 right now so hopefully this gives me some merit) but the way that I know how to do this is the derivative of an equation f(x) is the equation of the tangent line at any given point. The tangent line at a point gives you the slope. To find the mins and max, if you remember from lecture, is a little curve where a function is increasing or decreasing and then turns back around, thus the function has to have a point in the "turn around" where the slop is zero. When the slope is zero the tangent line is flat. To find where the tangent line is equal to zero, you have to set the derivate equal to zero (remember the derivative is the equation of the tangent line) and solve for what x values make that equation equal to zero. Once you have the x values, you will then need to find what y values correspond which is when you plug in the x values into f(x). Those x values with the y values will give you a coordinate pair where the mins and max are.

As I‚Äôve said a few times in this thread, pain is more of an emotion than a sense because it is much more heavily modulated. And that‚Äôs pretty important to note. Pain processing for me was taught in the affective neuroscience class, not the behavioral neuroscience class.  Allocation of resources is a legit component here but there is way too much conflation with other things in this thread and not enough inclusion of the complexity of pain processing on a physiological level.   What you described in the last part is competitive inhibition, and you are stimulating different nerves to overwhelm the signals before it even reaches the brain. That‚Äôs not about the brain maxing out it‚Äôs bandwidth,

I guess it isn't technically inconsistent but it sure feels that way, in that the feeling was that wights couldn't navigate water in whatever manner but now they can. There is nothing concrete to say otherwise, sure.  Dead things in the water could refer to a number of things including simply wildling corpses floating in the water (killed by the Others or Nights Watch or even the slavers) to actual undead beings attacking them from the seas. I do think it means wights, but we don't know that yet either.
I'm going to keep riding and running, but not alone at night in places like that.  And I'm investing in a mini taser that I can easily grab.  I used to be really indignant when told to "be careful" because I'm a woman.  It's not right, it's not fair, but our reality warrants reasonable precautions.  I hope karma catches up with those guys, but it's very likely that they'll keep doing shit like that and get away with it.  Hopefully I'll shrink their pool of targets though.

Depends which comic book you want it to feel like, really.  I would agree Ragnarok does a great job at looking and feeling like the old Kirby days. But Winter Soldier had a feel not too dissimilar from the CA and Nick Fury stories it was based on (Nick Fury vs SHIELD is a forgotten gem)
I compare her to LB since they do share similar play styles. LB has dashed that can move her a screen away, Q&gt;R&gt;E and then got back to where she first used W.  2 abilities which are just point and click and not to mention resets the Q burst passive. A good LB is rarely in danger if all they are going for is QRE combo. It should be instant. Zoe abilities r pretty strong but that‚Äôs if they land (except E), they can miss Q and not do anything. I do agree that Zoe is currently busted but there have been other champs that were worst IMO. I just feel like ppl hate Zoe since she they don‚Äôt see her play style as fun. I still think the worst champ ever made was Yasuo. How can a champ be 0-15 and the ult once because Ali got a knock up and ace the team with ease? He didn‚Äôt get punish for being behind. If Zoe is 0-15 all she can do is sleep 1 person which can be countered by an item.

No, not really iirc.
&gt; I was unequivocally making claims about html existing or not existing in that world.  That's not unequivocal, as: I didn't get that at *all* from your post.  I also think that's an ambitious and utopian claim, and I'd love to see some evidence which supports it.  Also, I'm not sure what you mean by this:  &gt; 'we now have native runners for web assembly'  Isn't that exactly the opposite of what WASM is? The entire point of WASM is that it's a bytecode interpreter? Are you implying that there's a version of WASM that compiles to native binaries? May I have a link to it, because I would be curious to see that project.

I‚Äôm sorry your going through this. I know how hard the anxiety and stress of it all is. I think we need to remember that we are lucky because there is treatment. And we are being watched carefully, right? It‚Äôs rare to go fully blind from glaucoma these days. As long as we catch it early, we should be fine. If it helps, my dad has had glaucoma for like 30+ years and he still sees fine and has absolutely 0 complaints about glaucoma. All my relatives with glaucoma are fine as well. The oldest one being 88.  Try not to stress yourself!! I know I‚Äôm a drama queen about it all but I would hate for you to feel as scared as I do. We are in good hands ! Treatments and surgeries keep advancing. 
It's really sad. It's the players that consume the product yet absolutely everyone else in the industry from publishers to developers to journalists are ignoring or outright denying what the players want.   &amp;#x200B;  Case in point: Journalist thinks BL3 needs a battle royale yet people literally cheered when it was confirmed to not have battle royale. Obviously not everyone in the industry is doing this but it's quite a majority. I'm both interested to see the future of the industry and worried about it.

YWBTA - I understand where you‚Äôre coming from and I think it can be normal to have a reaction like that but that still doesn‚Äôt mean asking her to delete all photos of her and her ex is the right call. The idea of erasing an entire relationship, especially a long term one, from your social media actually makes me kinda sad. Maybe their relationship ended on good terms and she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to delete all their good memories. You can appreciate and respect and even have love for people who you used to date but that doesn‚Äôt take away from your ability to move on and love someone else fully. There‚Äôs a reason she‚Äôs not with him anymore though. It would be a good thing to do for her and for yourself to find out how to move past an insecurity like this, maybe as your relationship grows you‚Äôll find that her old relationship doesn‚Äôt feel as intimidating

Interesting that it mentions that the "elite" players can make upwards of $80,000 just to show up.  I'm guessing Bananas, Wes, CT, Cara Maria must all make more than 6 figures in appearance pay...I remember hearing Bananas saying on Challenge Mania that Zach gets paid a lot just to show up nowadays as well.  Nany said a few years ago that she makes more than a year's salary for her "actual" job to go film a season.

I honestly dont know what to say about these people who feel they are placed unfairly.   I have consistently been a Plat 1/Diamond 5 player and thats right where I ended up after my placements.

In fact my point was exactly what your last sentence is about. There would be no gender-based discrimination, no genderfluids, no non-binary... If gender wasn't something people gave a fuck about
But even excluding the nitty gritty (stuff like KP calling her his slave), the point is there's still enough information to show that the girl is clearly alleging rape and that KP did have sex with her at his apartment that night.  You don't have to believe the my slave stuff, even the NY Post article says the police haven't found evidence of any kind yet to say that happened.  But KP did have sex with this girl that she is currently arguing wasn't consensual.

3 million more people came out to vote against Trump in 2016 and it made literally *zero* difference to the outcome. So, this isn't a question of whether people are coming out, it's who will be coming out and *where* they are coming out from that matter. Pushing incumbents at the expense of more engaging and likeable candidates is *stupid*. They are ensuring future losses in swing elections by picking favorites regardless of voter opinions.

The war on opioids is saving lives. But it‚Äôs also killing people like me.   (George Frey/Reuters) By John Heubusch March 27 John Heubusch is a novelist and the executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute in Simi Valley, Calif.  We had tried everything to stop the spread of my cancer. My doctor felt it was time for me to go home, get my affairs in order and say my goodbyes. ‚ÄúGet your Christmas shopping done early,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have just a few months to live.‚Äù  Five years have passed since that grim day and, strange as it might seem, there have been times I‚Äôve regretted undergoing the last-minute medical gambles that saved my life.  I am not alone. Victims of tragic accidents, disease onset, combat wounds, complicated surgeries, workplace injuries, gun violence or even a simple fall off a ladder are among the 20 million Americans like me who experience some form of high-impact, chronic and often debilitating pain. Many, given a second chance at life after a serious illness or injury, tragically choose suicide over pain. Why? The most unfortunate among them, those with life-altering, unspeakable pain, are being denied access to the medications they need to go on. Their doctors, now numbering nearly 70 percent of our front-line physicians, have enlisted in the nation‚Äôs war on opioids. Many have turned away from their patients in chronic pain.   When you see news stories declaring that federal action is driving fewer questionable opioid prescriptions, that Purdue Pharma is in deep trouble for allegedly creating millions of OxyContin addicts, and that the United States has stepped up the fight to interdict drugs on our nation‚Äôs borders, no doubt there‚Äôs reason to applaud. Lives are being saved. The rising number of deaths since 2015 that necessitated this war on opioids is most often not the fault of doctors or their patients in chronic pain. The real blame ‚Äî where the war will be won or lost ‚Äî lies with the illegal trafficking of opioids on the street where you live.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention knew this when it trained its guns on the opioid epidemic three years ago. Revising its guidance to physicians in 2016, it sought to limit opioid treatment practices that were outside the bounds of common sense and sound public health. The CDC‚Äôs intended audience should have been small; a limited number of bad actors and a minority of doctors overprescribing for short-term pain were the CDC‚Äôs real target. But the guidelines were ambiguous and short-sighted. The immediate result: confusion at major medical conferences, inside hospital boardrooms and, most troubling, in just about every doctor‚Äôs office.  Next came the law of unintended consequences. At least 33 states, each seemingly eager to outdo the other, have passed their own measures to severely reduce or eliminate the use of such drugs to treat pain. ‚ÄúJust say no,‚Äù the national refrain from the 1980s in the war on crack cocaine, has become the standard of care for patients with severe pain.   Enter President Trump. His battle cry, verbatim: ‚ÄúWhether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we will find you, we will arrest you, and we will hold you accountable.‚Äù  Lumped in with drug pushers and heroin traffickers, even law-abiding doctors who have responsibly treated patients in chronic pain with opioids began to cower. Just what were these new laws? What dosages for each unique patient with a unique set of needs will keep a doctor out of prison? Administrators of major medical research institutions, teaching hospitals, national pharmacy chains and most particularly overworked private practitioners were not going to wait for answers. With visions of Drug Enforcement Administration agents in their waiting rooms, they headed for their bunkers, leaving desperate patients behind.  We have reached the point where doctors believe the next prescription they write for opioids to treat chronic pain might be their last. In my own case, I‚Äôve had to undergo countless unsuccessful procedures and near superhuman efforts to be granted barely enough medication to try to live a normal life. Even those doctors with the courage to prescribe them for chronic pain sufferers are finding the hurdles established by federal and state reporting requirements so onerous that they are simply turning patients away.   Opioid prescriptions have shrunk substantially, but Washington‚Äôs goal now is to cut their number by a further one-third. In a bitter irony, opioid overdose deaths continue to hover at an all-time high. Many chronic pain patients, denied prescriptions, are self-medicating on the street, using synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, 50 times more powerful than heroin. There, danger and overdose lurk around every corner. Even worse, some who have lost all hope for pain relief are choosing to end their pain by ending it all. The risk of suicide among patients with chronic pain is twice that of those without it.  Three weeks ago, more than 300 medical experts wrote to the CDC noting the increase in suicides tied to the agency‚Äôs widely misapplied guidance. The patients in chronic pain they defend are not addicts. Far from it. There is a terrible truth for our government complicit in this crisis of its own making: Though it can regulate prescriptions for those in need, it cannot regulate pain.

Free parking is not a good alternative.  Free parking means that absolutely everyone parks there and there's no longer space for staff to park.  There is also not likely to be enough space for every single student to park on campus.  The university I went to had a fantastic alternative.  Included in your tuition was a "Go pass" which gave you unlimited access to public transportation (including light rail).  And then parking is absorbent.  So everyone (including staff) take public transit.

Thanks everyone! I'm going to reconfigure, drop the corrosion, vanguard, and OwtM, and swap in Pioneer, Bone to Ash, and one more (haven't decided).  I may increase the plains count by 1 as well.  Let's see how it does!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;

I only go to the hospital if it's a 10. Both times it was a kidney stone.  Anything under kidney stone pain is tolerable. I might rate myself lower than I should be because I compare everything to that specific pain.  "It hurts so much you're crying"  "Yeah but I didn't throw up."

Probably the budget and high end devices aren't much different anymore because the innovation plateaued. Samsung produces to little budget devices and are focusing more on high margin technologies. There chip business has proper margins and is on of the worlds best. They want to manufacture all the CPUs and are already producing the Snapdragons because there one of the few with an 7nm production. In the mobile storage / RAM space there are also prominent and of course mobile oled panels.  Samsung tries more and more to focus on high margin and innovation depended  technologies to make them money.   If you sell your parts to every manufacturer and everyone who isn't dirt poor has a phone that is a lot more money to be made. If you do not compete in the space yourself you also aren't a thread to your customers. They will probably still make high end devices but more in the Microsoft way (a commercial product that also shows of the possibility of their technologies.

I don't think this is exactly true, but I see where you're coming from. I watched a lot of Destiny for a while, not really anymore (MoonMoon is my thing now), and Destiny fans will often go hard on people who they think are misrepresenting Destiny's opinions, but they'll also go hard on Destiny himself if they think he's doing some dumb shit. Like during the whole New Zealand trip saga, a lot of destiny fans were weirdchamping just as hard as everyone else, if not harder.

Everything people are saying below about meeting with dogs they know is good but it's not enough if he's got a fear of new dogs. You will have to approach new dogs to increase that confidence, you just have to do it carefully, slowly and let him take the lead. Coax and encourage but never force.

Yes, I understand. I don't have confirmation on what that directory is as I genuinely don't know. *BUT* having looked around in this underneath in the FreeBSD, I think it would be the home directory of the user that you're authenticating as for said SFTP server. I think if you authenticate as "root" then that would be the actual root directory on the SRX.  This by the way shouldn't change between platforms. It all should be the same regardless of platform.

Think of the soul food episode from The Boondocks and you aren't far off. Also, yes; it's better.
The thing is, it feels like it's going to keep getting worse before it gets better. Dark skies ahead for the Hawks.  I'll continue to support the team, but it may be a while before I pay to go see a game again if they don't at least level out of this apparent nose dive soon. It's just so discouraging to see how quickly things have fallen apart after such a quick and messy 'fire &amp; hire.' It's also not a great feeling that the administration has gone radio silent since Lange was confirmed.  Billy Lange better get grinding to at least stop the bleeding.   Hate talking like the sky is falling, but it doesn't look good. THWND.
I consider him Scout/recon. I count his passive as recon atleast. I agree with you that his passive is lackluster and doesn‚Äôt affect the game at all. Most players can predict well enough where the next zone will be so it‚Äôs not a very useful passive. That‚Äôs why I suggest tweaking it and having it reveal enemies quickly on the minimap. There‚Äôs really no reason to use his passive in a match currently. Kind of a wasted opportunity at the moment for him.

 Adding an output delay to the mains is similar to pushing the speakers upstage. Sound travels at roughly one foot per millisecond. Adding a delay effectively introduces a phase delay making the source less "in phase" with the mains. You will hear a slight delay in the mains but may get an additional 3-6 db of gain on an open mic. Worth a try. Sometimes flipping polarity on the input (phase reverse) helps as well.

&gt; the British know they were going to win the war no, not at all, and even if they'd taken that risky gamble following Kursk it would still have taken months for the decision around tonnages of shipping to reach down the supply chain. in addition the Japanese were poised to invade Bengal.   Churchill's writing on this is good for a bit of balance.

If you stand in specific places some enemies aggro into collision boxes that push them off of edges. I believe it sounds like this is what you saw happen to the Silver Knight. Sometimes enemies just aren‚Äôt smart enough to know that there is a ledge they shouldn‚Äôt walk off of between you and them. The painting guardians you had to pass in the rafters to get where you are now are super easy to trick into falling instead of fighting them.

You can shake the poke plus too fyi.
&gt;How is the car supposed to avoid a rear end collision? Speed up and t bone the ambulance?   Firstly, the car was rear ended and went through and didn't get t boned. So, that wasn't a threat especially since ambulances don't fly through red lights, they are aware of the danger hence why they were slow and didn't get hit. They were probably fully stopped, off screen.  But to answer, prevention. In terms of coming up to lights, stops, etc., and you have a large vehicle behind, you should be alert that they don't stop as quick, especially if they don't see you. Can't do much outside change lanes or to blow a light, when allowed such as here or if it went yellow (this was a judgement call, here).  Again, many might be shocked this happened, but go ride a motorcycle. This situation, what's going on behind is just as important as in front of you. We don't have the luxury of impact zones. We do have the ability to guess on what might happen. Truck behind me while approaching a light? Super sketchy.  Case and point, approaching lights, and these count since it could go yellow just the same, be aware of who is behind you.   Is it cammers fault? No. But so much of what's in this sub is avoidable on some degree. Stopping may have actually not been the safest thing to do. You still have a green light and ambulance drivers aren't taught to blast red lights for this reason. 
Fucked your diapers lol 
Since we got Chronicles and it became clear that Azeroth was a titan I started wondering about Elune.  The only thing that makes sense is that Elune is just Azeroth, the unconscious and growing world soul.  Consider how the night elves came to be and what the well of eternity was literally.

I swear the cutoff was 56ap/pot on average but I could be wrong.
What excites you about pro wrestling? What gimmick matches do you like? What dream matches do you want to see? (With the in game roster). What Superstars do you like but aren't being pushed how you like?   For me, tournmamets excite me about pro wrestling so I incorporate a lot of them into my Universe. I love tag team wrestling so I made a lot of teams to play.   I've always wanted to see dream matches like Sting vs Taker, I always thought Kane should have gone over HHH for the World title, I think the King of the Ring should be a tournament to decide who is the King and give them the #30 in the Rumble, I think I could push Roman and others better on TV (I probably can't, but this is my Universe).   So my Universe is based around all that. You may think you have to be creative, but I don't think you have to be so creative and on top of that, I think you can be creative you just might be thinking too much about this mode.   Just put some stars into a rivalry and run it. Set available goals for the Superstars on your roster and let the show run its course. Customize as much as you want from the way your RAW arena looks to the types of PPVs you run. Delete Summerslam in August and run Survivor Series or delete MITB in June and download a classic PPV you like instead.   Use different championships too. Why use the WWE Championship as your top prize when you can use the UK Championship? There's an idea, run a UK based RAW promotion!   See, the ideas just flow. It's really such a bland mode and there isn't much to think about. Trust me, I used to overthink Universe mode and when you look at it barebones, it's really just do whatever the hell you want. Now the ideas just flow and most of the times it just takes a little bit to get the gears moving. It'll happen as Universe goes on too.   Don't do what's on TV because that's one of the reasons you're getting bored. You should go as far as running a WCW promotion or modern ECW promotion with updated titles and a mix of classic and modern stars.   Bottom line, I don't know you but I do know that everyone has a little creativity in them. Sometimes it just takes a little bit to get it out. Some come up with ideas on the spot, others need to get in a groove. You might need to stick with universe mode for a couple of in game months until you start getting ideas.   Fun tip: your first month in Universe mode is usually pointless. I'm not sure about this current game, but I know from WWE 12-WWE 2K17 the general rule was pretty much "the first month is pointless as the game is still recognizing the roster, rivalries, and schedule" so nothing exciting is really going to happen in your rivalries until June.   Another idea, try starting Universe Mode at the Road to WrestleMania season. Meaning start a new universe and don't touch anything. Simulate up on the beginning of January and then set up your shows and all that. Then play from January to WrestleMania (this hasn't been tested by me, but I thought it would be a good idea so idk how well it would work).   Anyways, I hope you find the fun in this mode and I hope this helped too.

Already told Mm yesterday when they were in town. They'll get right on it....
How much affinity your gear gets depends on how you got that affinity.  - Your warframe ability kills = 100% to the frame  - Your weapon kills = 50-50 to the frame and killing weapon  - Teammate kills and other sources = 25% to your frame and 75% equally split between your weapons. Bringing 1 weapon will give it 75% of the affinity, while bringing 3 will give them 25% each.  Note that max rank gear will not change the distribution. So getting weapon kills with a max rank frame will still give 50% of the affinity to the weapon.  Also, enemy spawn (and by extension, total affinity) is affected by the amount of players in the squad. With more players spawning more enemies. You won't get as much affinity with just 2 of you vs 4 of you.

To be honest, PvP could be balanced but it'd require a shift in Bungie's ideas on Multiplayer  &amp;#x200B;  * No one hit kills, except in high risk, high skill situations, or Supers that are all or nothing, and you risk dying while using and after, special weapons can one shot, but we'd need to go back to special ammo being pickups only. * Heavy Ammo would need to be a come back mechanic, meaning it only comes in late in the game, after 2-3 minutes so players have a chance to come back with it.  * Shotguns may potentially need a fundamental shift, good rates of fire and two tap quickly, like a 90 rpm shotgun can two tap fairly consitently and a tight predictable spread. * Handcannons need higher rpm, shorter range than Scouts, and Scouts are the reverse * Autos caaaaaan kill quickly, but only if they are all crits.  &amp;#x200B;  There's a lot more here, but in all honesty just look at Overwatch and TF2 and compare, and you'll get the idea.

There are different types they will label but they all serve the same purpose.  You might see some that say O/D, which means open discussion and anyone can attend. This also means someone picks a topic and people respond. A Closed meeting means it‚Äôs only for people who consider themselves alcoholics. Book study is going through the big book, and a speaker meeting is someone shares there story. I suggest starting out a an open discussion or a speaker meeting. AA is for anyone who has a desire to stop drinking. It changed my life and connected me with amazing people who are also in recovery.

The first thing I think you should know is that bipolar in itself isn't a completely negative thing. As people with bipolar we feel the world a lot more deeply than others and that can be a beautiful thing, if you're taking care of yourself.  What worked for me was explaining to them how I felt and why I did certain things. I noticed that for me my depressions and manic episodes have a very strong tie to my energy levels aswell as my moods and it's not that I don't want to do certain things it's just that I physically can't.   I hope this helps.
