I love the relief, the realisation
I agree. Remember that a national government-run licensing/training program effectively puts Trump (or Obama, depending on your political preference) in charge of your police.
Same, just woke up with a sub. Ain't complaining though
Just an absolute hot mess lol.
Yes I still have the bow and as I stated earlier it has limb damage and a vat perk
Can you elaborate on this?
Lucky you..
You just don't understand the greatness
Haha me too , take care
Papa bless.
There needs to be more green. All Italian restaurants serve it  with peas and so does Gordon Ramsey. Try it, it helps balance out the saltiness and peas are delicious.
Not to mention the complexity, accuracy and size of some of the images. The coordination and planning needed to pull of some of these crop circles in such a short amount of time seems extremely difficult for a group of people to pull off.
German police can assemble a riot force of a few thousand officers within a few hours at any point in the country.  Trains are under the jurisdiction of the federal police, they have a few officers at pretty much every slightly bigger station. Calling in a response unit isn't difficult nor does it take long. If in doubt, local state police can bolster the forces.

Ah ok, thank you! I’ve been longboarding for while and probably just never looked too closely at my board like this. And will do! I looked at them before buying a Magneto board but they were so expensive and were always sold out at the time. Plus I’m new to dancing. But thank you :)

I’m not seeing a difference here with this video. They are pinning the two men down waiting for nypd to arrive? The man is screaming he can’t breathe and they don’t let up physically.
And he went to prison and paid his dues. What more did you need from him.

As a Finn living in MA this has caught my interest ... what exactly is your plan here?  This subreddit got featured on /r/suomi and someone from there posted a good set of basic rules for a sauna in this subreddit. I think those are a very good starting point for making one.  Where are you getting a stove? I have not seen good quality providers of wooden stoves here.
NTA, these protests are becoming riots and any sane minded person wouldn’t be caught out there in the mess.
That was definitely a conversation my partner and I had before going downtown. We decided that it was worth the risk for us personally, but I am curious to see what the eventual ramifications are. For what it’s worth, almost everyone was wearing masks and at least making an effort to not come into physical contact with each other.

Let's be clear about what's happening. We were accused of censorship. The thread was locked by u/masta after he seemed concerned about that claim. Another mod unlocked it so the claim could be discussed. You continue to repeat that claim and your posts are still fucking here. You're accusing the very peope who are responding to you openly and keeping your posts up of censoring you. The mental gymnastics it takes to continue with that claim are amazing. Also, you never responded as to how you think we're manipulating the votes. Please, enlighten us with your theories.

It subsidizes it because of the vast amount of research that indicates living below the poverty line leads to increased levels of incarceration, worse health outcomes, decreased ability to get and keep work, etc.  It's for the good of everyone we don't have hordes of unhealthy dumbasses who can barely hold down entry level work. We have enough of that garbage already even with the meager help we give people. It may be distasteful for some, but without it we would be absolutely worse off.  As this research-backed article puts succinctly "Low well-being = less likelihood of investing in the future = worse outcomes, including across generations. "  [https://www.brookings.edu/research/snap-happy-welfare-poverty-and-well-being-revisited/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/snap-happy-welfare-poverty-and-well-being-revisited/)  People have been having unplanned pregnancies since time immemorial. I'd love to have more money go to education and schooling to help reduce the unplanned pregnancies rate, but people don't want to pay for it just to wait 20 years to start seeing the benefits either.
Finished Slayers NEXT last night. While I thought the beginning had a rocky start, I really started to get back into it at the midway point and loved the ending. It's a classic 90s type of ending, but god damned it was satisfying. Lina and Gourry have made it into my top tier ships. Honestly, they're an absolute riot together. One thing that really impressed me about the show, that i didn't realize until the very last episodes was Syphiel and her natural fit in with the rest of the cast. She's a late comer in both seasons, with relatively minor roles, yet meshes with the group as naturally as if she were with them from the beginning. Really the chemistry of all the characters with each other is top notch. The gags get me in stitches, the high triumphs get me hyped, and the crushing defeats make me sad. I'm pretty sure I said this last week, but Slayers really is just a fun fantasy adventure. It's just, fun, and I love it for that.   **Fun Doragon Slavu/10**

We can thank Billy Tauzin. He was a Democrat until 1994. That was when the GOP took the House for the first time in 40 years. Billy suddenly realized that he just didn't fit in as a D anymore.  When Medicare Part D was enacted Billy inserted the provision that said the government wasn't allowed to negotiate prices.  Then he retired and tried to hand off the seat to Billy Jr, who never had a real job in his life. Junior's previous job was lobbying a telecommunications subcommittee on behalf of Bell South. I don't think I need to tell you who chaired that subcommittee.  The voters of LA-3 had other ideas so Junior had to get a real job. Senior took a job with PhARMA, the industry lobbying groip, for a salary of over $1 million a year. But it had nothing to do with the ban on negotiating prices.  Then as a final kicker, in 2009-10 when our TVs were full of fraudulent ads promising us how great healthcare reform would be, guess who bankrolled the propaganda? PhARMA. In return Obama did nothing while lifesaving drug prices skyrocketed.

Yeah I got a little bag going that I collect it in. I’ve tried avb a couple times. The first time I put about a gram of it between two Reese’s cups and got blasted but then the second time I downed a pill bottle with 7gs of it in there and didn’t feel anything. I went to bed and woke up at 4AM feeling like my body was pulsating and had half a second to realize I was high af before passing out lmao.

the point of debate isn't to convince the other debator. it's to convice the judges/audience.  let him make himself a huge asshol.   let yourself appear calm and rational.  one or two zingers that seem to undermine his position (even if they don't really) should be enough that anyone reading the conversation will think you won.  of course, if you talk too much, he gets more opporutinities for zingers. try to limit your attack surface by letting him rant against innocuous questions, and avoid making statements yourself.
First I ordered the dual motor AWD for $50k. Then I thought, might as well order the Tri motor at $70k. If I can afford it by the time it comes out I'll get the tri motor. But if not then I'll get the dual motor.  Mainly the $100 locks in the FSD price. That's what I like about it. If FSD finalizes and the robo taxi network becomes a thing then the FSD price will go high so I want to lock it in.
No worries, I dont know shit about Navy uniforms and I've lived in Virginia Beach/Norfolk for most of my life.

That is such an odd honor.
Honestly I wouldn't recommend it, you need an insane amount of willpower because of the sheer volume it would take. If you do go with calisthenics you need to make sure you're progressively overloading. Doing more regular pushups doesn't help that much, I recommend doing the same # of pushups but upping the difficulty (second athlean x, he's a great source). And make sure you eat. Eat till you think you're going to throw up, I'm dead serious. If your frame is small (like mine), you need to eat like your life depends on it. Eat when you wake up and eat when you're about to go to bed. Drinking your calories is a good way to go about it (milk, yogurt, etc). It's possible but like I said, bodyweight is difficult. You'll see results relatively slowly and your diet needs to be excellent.

I think they did this a couple of years ago too. Good to know.
The idea is that some of those laws are unnecessary and not equally enforced. Example, MJ laws.   We’ve tried for decades with endless resources, arrests, deaths, etc to get people not to some pot. It hasn’t worked. But it has been an effective tool at creating probable cause to harass people, and minorities especially based on the stats.   Some laws exist because they know they’ll be broken, not because they’re just or because the majority even wants them. Get rid of those laws because they’re actually just tools to provide cover for aggressive policing.
Ooh nice where u
That's what I had read, too. That police know who he is, and are "screening" him for charges.  I thought that threatening a crowd with a weapon was a chargeable offense, but I guess not if you're white and "helping the cops"

I like the idea of him feeling powerful by exercising control over a big carnivore. It's partially why he was so comfortable with the Shishigumi, I think. But I just like the idea of him dominating legosi. Legosi is just a glutton for degradation: &gt;!he rips out his fangs just to please a herbivore, wishes he was born and insect, resents his body until he figures out that he can alleviate the self loathing by defending herbis.!&lt;
Go occupy city buildings and police precincts until you get the structural change you want. Block roads, trains, etc. don’t loot businesses because then you’re inviting extreme counter reactions by the police and making an easy villain of yourself.   Cops attacking peaceful protesters makes the police looks bad, cops attacking looting crowds makes the police look good  Look up the Orange Revolution or euromaidan. Violent protest movements generally get shut down hard, peaceful movements tend to win with enough popular support. Euromaidan heavily policed itself and not a single business in Kyiv was looted.
No thanks
It’ll take time... how long? We’ve had this problem since the United States was created. How much longer do they have endure the systematic racism?

Kuroko no Basket. I'm near the end of season 1, and while I'd still rank it below Ippo, Haikyu, and Run With The Wind (as well as others that are escaping me atm), I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I'm surprised that I hadn't watched it yet since it always seemed like something I'd like.
No. Media doesn't want you to see this so Obama, Hillary and George Soros killed everyone that reported on this and hacked their websites to take it down. But it's completely believable. Don't let liberals tell you it's not true. They are using alternative facts!

The post-assassination riot’s led to lots of local and state laws in the south, that to this day still discriminate against blacks.   All this violence just re-enforces the point, that the police need more flexibility, just to keep my business from being burned down.

Yeah I hear you. I was pretty reluctant even a week ago to believe things have gotten this bad but as I've seen the wager tokens become more useless, way less treasures available (they don't even give the treasure bundles every 300 levels anymore or whatever), ultra rares no longer immediately marketable, and the waste of time that is the sideshop, yeah, I agree it's gotten worse by a lot. I struggle because I don't want to miss out on the exclusives but I know it means I'm supporting a system which may eventually kill DotA 2 altogether
Farcry esque game with different regions of the USA that you can travel too. You get a permanent "ride" that you can upgrade along the way. Eventually you unlock hideouts, weapons, spells, etc. Main quest with side quests and procedurally generated "lairs" where you fight monsters and get loot. Maybe even a multi-player element where you meet each other at Hunter bars and go out in each other's game worlds to hunt in coop. They could drop DLCs with new monsters, regions, side quests etc to pad out the game as well.

Yeah, and I never said that those cops were justified.  All I said was that the rioters and looters are opportunists who are taking advantage of the message the protestors are trying to convey.   Riots dont do anything other than encourage the government to take harsher and harsher actions against them.  Protestors actually do something to make a change, perhaps occasionally riots help get the message acrossed faster, but that still doesnt justify them whatsoever.   The people protesting are good, as them doing that doesnt neccesarily benefit them in any way, but it also doesnt harm anybody else.  While the rioters/looters can benefit greatly from doing so, while it harms and disadvantages other people.  Tell me, which method is better.
there is also some seats that push you back more as well so might try that if your dead set on a sprty

It's not only about the cyclist though, if you're on the sidewalk you're a threat to people walking and in wheelchairs etc.  Car vs. you on the road is about equivalent to you vs. toddler walking on the sidewalk
I disagree. They’re both bad. It was awful that George was killed and the footage was so disturbing and obviously I think people have a right to be outraged. But looting and burning down buildings and all of the violence and stuff is also really bad. Now please correct me if I’ve been misinformed, but people are looting places and burning down places that are run or owned by people who had nothing to do with George’s murder, so they’re being punished for doing nothing. Basically, from what I understand, people are responding to violence with violence. I mean imagine if you owned a small business that you worked really hard on, and you go there tomorrow and the windows were smashed and it was totally looted and all? Wouldn’t you think that’s awful? The violence is hurting people who had nothing to do with George’s murder. It is really really bad.  (I’m kind of scared to post this comment bc I fear I’m gonna get a million downvotes but that’s just my 2 cents)

Apparently the police blinding, beating, gassing, arresting and shooting people with rubber bullets when they are just chanting is perfectly fine if there are fires 10 miles away or across the country.
Headspace is incredibly important for women. Being in the right headspace doesn't guarantee an orgasm. Being in the wrong headspace will pretty much guarantee you won't. It's easy to be distracted and worry about so many things, and sometimes despite your best efforts, you get thrown out of a good sexy happy headspace. But if you can relax, not focus on what your body looks/smells/tastes like its a strong step in the right direction for at least better enjoying the sex, whether you orgasm or not.
If you're unable to stand up for yourself and what you believe in because you are intimidated and don't know how to defend your position, then you are a coward and you have poor communication skills. But NAH it doesn't make you an asshole. And it's something lots of people have experienced. You can grow and improve. Good luck!

With the game you're a player in, I think it's the GM's decision. You should tell the GM that it's interuptive if this other player isnt paying attention and is making the game worse for you, but it's his call to respond to that how he sees fit for his game and your group as a whole. You have the ability to leave if it isn't fun for you anymore with this distracted player.   In the one-shot you want to run, it's your choice. I personally get annoyed but dont say anything when someone is on their phone when it's not their turn because my group is pretty good about listening and making decisions even when a little distracted. But playing a whole other game in the middle of a session is a real dick move from my perspective, and I would not let any player who couldn't stop and play along with the group stay.  You're not being too bossy your just asking for players to show some interest in the story and all the work you put in for the session, if they don't want to do that then they shouldn't play in that group.  Edit: a word
Yea I'm really active on this sub that's probably why

Wtf is that a BEAR GIBBY?!?!
as someone who got to have some experience playing it, let me tell you that frankly compared to what the series offers nowadays, you really didn't miss much. the game was released not that long after the first generation of the main games and still definitely felt that old, and towards the end many of the monsters kind of abandoned interesting mechanics in favor of "AOE the whole map pls" because of power creep to keep subscribers. now that its dead here's to hoping some of them return in MH6 with updated fights.
Are they dead?
Yeah, only 40% of cops admit to abusing their families! That's not most!  60% of them are just the kind of people who cover for their buddies when they do violence.  And the forum is open for all requests for receipts on the study.
Well, I feel like in the plot line I suggested, it is very much moving the plot forward. I'd certainly not be opposed to a "future war" movie, but bear in mind that was tried and failed. If they did a future war movie and defeated skynet however, I have the question, why didn't it use every tool available to win? Time travel is one of it's most powerful weapons, so I'm just jumping to the next most logical conclusion, either if skynet had concluded it is going to lose (or it already had lost but had contingency plans in place) it would most likely try to do as much damage as possible. Sending entire armies of killer robots back in time would certainly achieve that.

Yes I have But I see you So, you're not  Invisible or Alone
Looks amazing, can’t wait for it to come out
So i downloaded that mod youve sent me because SSEEdit seemed like a whole thing i cant be bothered getting into at 1AM. And obviously i found the last patch affecting Aela was immersive weapons (who wouldve thought...). I downloaded a patch but it didnt work because it only works for incredibly outdated AIO as i found out. So i just moved Bijin AIO below IW and all its patches and there we go its perfectly fine. Why a weapon mod decides to mess with npc face gen data ill never know...  Edit: Still, thanks. I probably wouldnt have found a solution if it werent for your help.
Lol maybe Bloomberg will run for NYC mayor again
I'd probably try and flip houses, to a degree. There are sites where you can bid on houses, either foreclosed or whatever.   Then you renovate.  Resell or rent.  I dunno, I think that's a cool idea.

Yeah me. Selfishly April was the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I collected unemployment, got caught up on my backlog of games, movies, and shows I’ve missed. I felt like I was making progress on my mental health, and I was starting to get my life together.   Then May happened and sent me back to reality. Both my parents got sick, and I’ve been busy trying to take care of them, and then this past week watching the US burn has erased all the progress I thought I had made on my mental health.   My parents being sick has allowed me to stay on unemployment so that’s helping out with bills and stuff, but I have no idea what’s going happen when that runs out.
remember, the homework.casa has never scammed anyone@!

I'm in Austin as well. Drove my son by the protest yesterday, but for his safety we did not get out. Thought it was important for him to see civil disobedience.
Destruction and violence is a dead end. You will never get the common folk behind you with this nonsense. It's not sustainable.
Cool shirt!
people like you are those who like to cry false victimhood like "heterephobia", white racism and "cops are being bullied".  police brutality culture is real but go r/police or anywhere else, they will deny that. any video will be justfied, even when there's no resistance. if george is not dead, cops will say the immobilisation is standard. any criticism about brutality will be downvoted. talks about systemic racism and corruption will be deleted. if there's no video, george floyd's death will be swept under the rug and his friends will cover it up. just like many others before this. you will never want to admit this.  in the face of systemic killing of black people being systematically erased by cops, people like you are enablers who will cry cops are being bullied.
They are so annoying

&gt; My Principal thought they were too young. Maybe they are — but this is happening to them. They deserve to share how they feel.  Everyone is too young to experience a worldwide pandemic that will fundamentally change society but the only way we will learn to cope with it is by talking about it.   Little children are exposed to the news. They overhear stuff, maybe they sit and watch the news with their parents. If they can't come to school, a place of learning, and discuss the facts and their fears, then what's the point of school?

Have you considered partially automating your job?  You could provide yourself the challenge of setting it up which would make the work more engaging, and there is an obvious benefit down the road when you make your job less menial and you build out your resume.
I'll take listening to medically trained professionals over anyone on this sub or a driver. If they say there's a way, I'm for it. But quite honestly we don't need Clint's opinion on it.
Things not to say to an abuse victim...this. If you've never experienced abuse it's hard to imagine people being vile to the ones they're supposed to love. But it happens and no one wants to hear that someone who doesn't know you tell you they think your memories and bruises are fake ☹️

Ms. Reade was work-shopping the book in a writing group that included Don Rogers, the publisher of the local newspaper, The Union. After Lucy Flores, a former Nevada politician, published an essay recounting an uncomfortable encounter with Mr. Biden — he squeezed her shoulders and kissed the back of her head during an event, she wrote — Ms. Reade informed Mr. Rogers she had her own story to share.  That story, she told The Union, was about “power and control” in an abusive workplace. “I wasn’t scared of him, that he was going to take me in a room or anything,” she told The Associated Press.  And a friend who said she heard of Ms. Reade’s complaint at the time — she worked for Senator Edward M. Kennedy but now supports President Trump — told Vox that Mr. Biden “never tried to kiss” Ms. Reade, and “never went for one of those touches.”  Ms. Reade’s account was in line with other public complaints against Mr. Biden and did not get wide coverage.  Yet she came under harsh attack online. Mr. Biden’s defenders dug into her digital history and, upon finding her praise of Mr. Putin and her Quora page, would use that — with no substantive evidence — to suggest she was a Russian plant. Ms. Reade taunted them, in turn.  Working with her friend Ms. Dale, she produced a comic video of a mock interview in which she denied being a Russian spy while speaking in a bad Russian accent and being offered a lunch of vodka and caviar.  Behind the scenes, there was new trouble. Ms. Reade had begun working as a field supervisor for the Census Bureau, but she left after clashing with superiors, whom she accused in a formal complaint of creating a hostile work environment and discriminating against her.  Her online embrace of Russia seemed only to intensify. After the release of the Mueller report documenting Russian meddling in 2016, Ms. Reade posted an essay that decried xenophobia and opened with the Putin spokesman Dmitri Peskov quoting a proverb: “It is very hard to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if it is not there.”  She was also finding common cause with Mr. Biden’s detractors on the left, many of whom supported Bernie Sanders and believed Russia had been unfairly maligned in coverage of the Mueller investigation.  Among them was Katie Halper, a left-leaning podcast host. It was on Ms. Halper’s show that Ms. Reade made the assault allegation.  This time, her story moved toward center stage, fodder in the online political wars.  Mr. Biden denied her allegation even as he defended her right to be heard, while his defenders took to Facebook and Twitter to highlight the change in her account and emerging accusations of deceit from her friends.  Republicans in turn accused Democrats of hypocritically ignoring the “believe women” battle cry of the #MeToo movement even as they gave a pass to the two dozen allegations of harassment and abuse lodged against Mr. Trump.  Ms. Reade, deluged with messages of encouragement and threat, was by turns timorous and combative.  She gained and then lost a high-profile lawyer, Mr. Wigdor, but quickly procured the pro bono services of a lesser-known consumer protection and civil rights lawyer, Daniel Hornal.  When The Times approached her to discuss details of this article, she referred reporters to Maria Villena, her public relations consultant, who asked for written questions. After The Times submitted them, the actress and #MeToo activist Rose McGowan posted them on Twitter, as an example, she said, of the newspaper’s “tactics.”  Ms. Reade also put The Times in touch with a number of supporters. Among them was a law school classmate, Joseph Backholm, who said she had told him about an assault by an unnamed senator when they were students together. Mr. Backholm has run an organization in Washington State that opposes same-sex marriage and has received funding from local donors to Mr. Trump.  Ultimately, Ms. Reade responded in a string of emails and text messages.  “By coming forward about Joe Biden,” she wrote on Friday, “I have lost everything again, my job, my housing and my reputation. I have been called every vile name imaginable and presented as a monster by the media for daring to speak about Joe Biden and what happened. But I am free.”
Do they seriously care?
They didn't dummy

Red herring. Typical tactic used to move away from the real issue at hand. Your agenda is blatantly obvious.
Can’t look into one specific day whether good or bad, but this is awesome news.  And the daily new cases reported are usually low on sundays but not the percentage positive.
Looks to me like the whole purpose the 2nd amendment exists... Is time to be truly be utilized.
Yeah I get you. For example Bill was a bit dumb, and I can’t remember if there was any instance, but if he was rude you almost felt like it was out of stupidity - instead Micah gave off proper nasty vibes (like the example you gave and also later in the story when he stops calling Arthur by his name and instead calls him ‘black lung’)
Honestly I could do it easily

Nominal voltage is 18V or 3.6V per cell.  162 Wh is the most accurate rating of this pack. And yeah, that is kind of splitting hairs, but this is ripped straight off the [Samsung 30T](https://www.imrbatteries.com/content/samsung_30T.pdf) spec sheet.  Figured it was also worth mentioning because Dewalt wrongly claims 180Wh on the bottom of this pack. Because they incorrectly use max Voltage to calculate their Wh rating.

you make excellent points re this not being some sort of scalable magic widespread solution.  But the more of these effective treatments we identify, the more cumulative patients we can treat.

I just passed the one year anniversary of finding my black kitty after he was lost for 6 weeks. He too had never been outside except for once in 2012 where he was lost for 3 weeks. In 2012 he found his way back to food left on the porch, but last year was a different neighborhood and he was living about 3 blocks away around a house that fed their outdoor cats. In the end it was people who had my number, spotted a black cat, and called me to investigate that were the reason I found him. They had my phone number because of either the signs I posted, or the "pet amber alert" I paid for. It was pricey, but the nearest 500 homes received a call, description, and my contact info. A guy walking his dog noticed my cat and called me.
Is it me or do most of these "protesters" deserve a knee on the back of their neck.
Thank you white person for telling me how terrible my race is. I'm sure you're not a white supremacist.
They doesn't mean that you start tear gassing people. Are they hurting anyone being in the streets?  Outside of making it a pain in the ass for some drivers, what harm is there?
I was missing barrows yesterday and cranked out like 80 chests. It's so much fun.
It's kinda what I was expecting so its ok

Maybe there is another media player app in your TV’s App Store? If it has one... alternatively you could just download the h264 version of that video. H265 (HEVC) is newer and supported as widely as h264.
What, I mean all protesters here.  Not just blacks.  I mean, come on, it should be noted that most whites do not hate blacks and support them.  There are more than just black’s protesting.  Hell, I am all for no police brutality and for accountability. But rioters need to stop looting.  It makes the whole movement look like crap.
Calling them "reporters" is like calling Hitler "humanist". They do report the "news", just their favorite kind of "news". Hitler did like humans, just his favorite kind of humans.
Right. They're playing to an audience, and that audience has always and should always include you (the LGBTQ community).   Conversely, I actually felt like this was one of the first shows I've watched where this inclusion seemed pretty normal/natural (I watch a lot of period/BBC stuff normally so there's not much solid representation). While the age thing/power difference is cause for concern, I actually think as a straight person I was more uncomfortable with the idea of someone just *realizing they are gay* like that, naturally (or maybe before that point, but still pretty organic).   That's the kind of ingrained homophobia/problematic thinking that's hard to recognize in ones self and deal with societally. But I think the producers purposely did it that way, and that when people are uncomfortable with this scene, unconscious ideas about what a relationship should be are at the root, more than the predatory aspect...  Probably too deep a take for a Sunday night, but I've been trying to be more conscious about my internal reactions to things, and where they're rooted.
How much fuel and fusion do you have? I’ll 1:1 you
Don’t know if it specifically was looted- just couldn’t do a drive by.  The target on the lower level was looted, with fires both Sat and Sunday am.  Very sad and short sighted. A lot of places were hit in the area and am thankful it didn’t spill into my neighborhood.
Two things:  1. Making his support public can actually influence a huge number of people which could lead to a change in their mentality and actions.   2. I’m not talking about just tweeting about the situation, he already made a few IG posts. I’m taking about donating to a beneficial cause or creating a charity, something that only someone in his position can do to such a level.
thank you and good luck
Doing stuff with 2 accounts even when I could do it more efficiently with 1, like KBD and stuff, since I have to put more abilities on revo. Also doing KBD in the first place when I could be doing something else.
Thanks for the message, I almost actually fully gave up on Uber Eats but I gave it another try, included the information. Sent a text restating instructions, they actually parked downstairs which is nice because they got into the building without saying no one's there.  I did say I would tip higher, to one of them, and I said a specific amount to the other. I also said I'd understand if they have to leave it downstairs but I genuinely cannot get it and no hard feelings, and I guess this last part helped a lot in not seeming like a dick even if I am a dick according to some. They took a while so I think they both just took the stairs, I didn't even mention taking the stairs as an option. Anyway tipped both of them a little over 150% the order value so I hope this pushes things a little more in the right direction to make up for all the scumbags lying about tipping and the looters downstairs.

&gt;Attractive does not denote good..  Good thing it doesn't say attractive then! The word is something like "desire". Better still, what desired the fruit? Her eye. In the Hebrew Bible, doing what you wanted is called "doing what is right in your own eyes".  Better still, the Hebrew word for tree is "eyts". The Hebrew word for "counsel", as in, a teaching, is "eytsah".  Just read the verse:   "When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it."  Take note of each step: she saw it was **good** for food, it was **pleasing** to the eye, and **desirable** for gaining wisdom.  So you've got the woman's moral sense desiring a fruit that gives one wisdom. That sounds pretty close to what OP is saying...  Honestly, this is slightly more complicated than you're making it out to be. If you follow it through, you end up landing on a position that's near "This is a story using myth and imagery to convey the human status".  Swearing at me and getting angry doesn't do anything to bolster your position, it just makes you look childish. I would engage with what's being said, or just leave the topic alone.  &gt;I'm done with you sorry, I'm not tolerating bullshit like you, Stop the red herring and stick to the fucking topic   I thought I was exactly on topic? I'm really confused by your response here.
I thought i was the only idiot who did this lmao geez

I usually have a good experience with the CQ at Hwy 7/East Beaver Creek
they are good for the player playing them but really nobody else. late game just means the rest of the team has to carry them as basically a backdoor play to undo the effects of shared xp. so you get degenerate "strategies" like lane freezing (smart "late game" people would give a solo lane all the way to the core just because it doesn't significantly change their win condition) and the robo traded uncontested map timings this game has lived with for a long time because there's no reason to fight the other team 4.5v5 and the game slides into purely xp driven defense. the "late game" team only ever needs to stay roughly xp even and they are winning. but who the hell really plays or watches hots for 20 minutes of stalling or to play a "typical moba"?

True, in fact, I don't think Jonathan ever told his father anything about Dio, not the dog kicking, girlfriend kissing, or dog burning it was kinda weird, it's not like he was **that** much of a pushover.  Perhaps he was shocked at how much of a dick Dio was.
Okay but like their skin is so good already wtf

It might be of note that my braces push my lips out making the chin look more recessed, but do you think getting TADs to fix my bite and putting my top teeth over the bottom and fixing my overbite will help with my chin too?
Your comment pretty much encapsulates the whole fucking protests, doesn't it?  Quashing the protests against police brutality with *more* police brutality seems like a really fucking ***great*** way to get people to remain peaceful and de-escalate the situation.   Watching as a foreigner, keeping up with the updates has been sickening and has me *beyond* disgusted at what the disenfranchised US citizens are going through right now, but I literally cannot even imagine what it must be like to be living under the direct boot heel of those fascist fucks.
Nothing you said was useful at all.
Did Fidelity say you had to call? I had that too for orders over 10,000. I gave them a call, they warn you about some unique risks with penny stocks, and set your account to allow it moving forward.
Thank you for that. No, they actually show aggression to this cat. It’s probably because he’s the runt of the litter. He’s separate from his colony. In comparison, to other cats he’s living pretty good. So far, I’ve set up a box for him and he’s been spending time there.

You can do all the transfers for the parking permit online. I bought a new car pre-quarantine but was able to do everything but print the temporary permit without going into the office (and that was because I don't have a printer and why would I pay FedEx to print it when the Parking office will do it for free).  When I had my new plates (vs the dealer temps) they transferred my old permit number online and I used my old permit sticker on my new car.  ETA, I did garage my new car for two days because I purchased it on a Saturday and they won't do the permit paperwork before you have the temp license number.
I swear to Naughtius Maximus, I just re-watched this film last night and laughed so hard, and then this song made me more optimistic of life nowadays, which can be difficult.

The 3600x is not worth the extra money. You can get the 3600 for cheaper and it performs about the same with a mild overclock. You can use the extra money towards an rx 5700xt. If you’re sticking with the 5700, don’t. Go for a 5600xt. It has VERY similar performance for a cheaper price.

They stopped and we're holding the guy before police came.  They had no idea that had even taken place.  They shot first and asked questions later.
Well, politely kneeling didn't seem to work.
Sigh of course someone did...
The problem with these rioters is that they’re attacking citizens that have no part in the murdering of George Floyd. Small businesses are burning thanks to opportunistic looters and black people too led on by social media to see what’s right and wrong,.  In every other violent protest it was never directed at the citizens as they had all banded together against the oppressing government.

unless there was a reported previous attack by this dog they rarely put the dog down. Bet you though there are other attacks. when my brother was attacked by a neighbour's pitbull we reported it because he had to go to hospital. Later we had other people on the street telling us they were also previously attacked. Mom was furious and told them if any of them had filed a police report they dog would have been euthanized at a 2nd unprovoked attack. The cops told her this.

If you, under any circumstance, are willing to undermine a protest then you were never interested in the cause to begin with.   Also protesters are never the instigators with police. The police are the ones showing up with guns, tanks, and gas like they ready for WWI

I am Anti-Fascist, I’m not Antifa. Why is this whole thread acting like that’s not a thing... Antifa is definitely an Anti-Fascist ideology that involves violence and ignoring that people in this ideology exist is irresponsible. Labeling every Anti-Fascist as Antifa is even more irresponsible.  Not saying they should be labeled a terrorist group, because that’s unconstitutional.

Thanks for the link and for giving more perspective on the topic. I completely agree and hope the discourse can be changed (or at least challenged).
Definitely agree with the stupid opinions on food.   I actually have coeliac disease so can't eat bread, but no way in hell would I want gluten free bread in my dream restaurant! That's just crazy!
I'm...not seeing anything in there about what your PM says about all this bullcrap, nor about how you've both called USPIS? It reads like you've been trying to handle this yourself. Kinda above your paygrade, bud. USPIS and local police need to get involved. No hours on a route is enough to play this game.  I get the early stuff, hey, kinda crappy, but whatever, but you have people messing with the mail now, time to bring in management and law enforcement.
I agree, but on the other hand the game is already pretty complicated with magic and everything.

There are few competitors because Clinton's deregulation in the 90s cleared the way for frenzied consolidation of the financial giants.  Look, I'm not saying that regulation is a panacea, especially not when the few regulations that actually do exist are entirely written and pushed through by the industry they're supposed to regulate.  However, if history has proven anything, its that people will try to get away with anything they think they can get away with.
D&amp;D itself being for all ages doesn't mean that all D&amp;D communities should always strictly be for all ages. It's possible to play D&amp;D without ever stepping into the D&amp;D subreddit, and it's possible to be active in the D&amp;D subreddit without seeing NSFW posts. In fact, reddit makes it very easy to do so.  Jsyk, if you're a minor and you've made your account able to view posts like the one in question, I'm pretty sure you've violated reddit's TOS and your account could theoretically be suspended.
I’m sure they’re cool! But I don’t think they’re close.
Imagine actually believing you are capable of applying any amount of pressure to the global elite to actually make a difference. The .01% could wipe us all out and have enough resources to do it thrice over. You either play by their rules or you don’t get to play at all. Maybe instead of putting on a holier than thou attitude on reddit, you could come show us what you can change in the real world in the next 5 or 10 years. You’ll fail like everyone else. You’re welcome to prove us wrong though, unless the extent of your effort is making this post to feel better about your political dreams, then you’re no different than anyone else.

There are cities without prejudice?
It’s not just some braids, out of ignorance idols often use iffy language and terminology (first that comes to mind is the use of “exotic” and “ethnic” to refer to music styles), irresponsibly use harmful stereotypes for comedy (Wendy has had minor scandals involving This before), and mainly the fact that some black westerners feel that the heavy inspiration in fashion and music styling from rap, r&amp;b, and hip hop is negatively appropriative (I guess the idea is that a part of black culture is a history of marginalization and existing as an underclass, so to use those styles without any kind of connection to the core message is questionable and easy to do insensitivly). Keep in mind though I am not a black kpop fan so take my secondhand explanation with a grain of salt, I could be very wrong.
Maybe... a new Titan I’ve discovered may hold the key to that.
Some day we'll have two parties again that are "left" and "right".  that both rely on honest data again, even if they disagree with what we should do about the data - they'll start from actual data. That both respect science.  We'll be able to talk about our difference of opinion, and try to find some common ground where we think we're improving the situation while balancing each other's views.  That day will never come with this current republican party.  They've been increasingly extremist my entire life. The parties we have right now are the "Human Decency" and "return to 1940 germany" parties. Welcome to the big tent.
I think a lot more people fake it than you realize. I don’t see that as a huge deal. Sometimes you just can’t be bothered.

All I see is drama. It would take 5 seconds for a guy to show ID. I done it tons of times when I was pulled over.  Because of it you mean police can't arrest the suspect if he say that he's not that person without a proof? LMAO.
You’re not really judging an individual now are you? It’s really more like oh idk generalizing an entire race based on statistics that show they commit more crimes when in reality this means they’re CONVICTED of more crimes, statistics also show that black people and other people of color are convicted and charged more often and more harshly for the same crimes, which sounds like a huge cop out because you want it to be, when it’s simply the truth.
Sorry no, Australia, but if you could consider sending it to me would be happy to pay the extra shipping!

Not really. I mean, as a native English speaker there’s a much larger disconnect when compared to Italian, but I can figure out a lot of words on inference. But then again I also speak Spanish so that might help.

To be fair, you really don't need communication in like 90% of the content in this game. And for the stuff that you do need communication in, discord is way better than destiny's built-in voice chat
Well it’s a bit strange because the dialogue in anime is oftentimes not very realistic or how people talk everyday.

I can't figure out how to add my other pics but this is so weird
Don't do that. Don't give me hope.
Yes
Literally almost every game. Not even joking. Maybe they’re not all Smurfs but for my own sanity I have to assume all players under lvl 100 at this point four years into the game are smurfs

Are you sure about that? The US does have a list of terrorist organizations and the power to mess with people considered to be affiliated with them.
I’m watching Fox News because my grandpa is visiting, and I gotta say the regular channel is not bad at all. They’re more or less repeating the same things as CNN about how the protests are good but the looters are bad, how George Floyd was wrongly killed, and more or less the same thing. I guess it’s lacking the philosophical soliloquy’s of Don Lemon though  Edit: when I say regular channel I mean like not fox and friends and tucker Carlson and stuff. Just like the generic newscasters
THANK YOU! I need this.

Get what get
&gt;The only thing would be whether PS is worth it.  It could be.  I think that if the entire display-system were (a) PostScript and (b) part of a integrated/foundational system \[think IBM’S SOM\] — this would allow the PostScript+display-engine to be exposed to the GUI-system.  &gt;It'd might be great and work just fine, possibly for a niche programming language that wouldn't be a problem, but everyone seems to go towards HTML/XML or other ML based GUI building. Actually, I'm interested to know what do you think of this trend.  HTML and XML are a poor serialization-format. The record-format that Delphi used \[DCR. IIRC\] was slightly nicer…but what we actually want is the base-metaobject mentioned above to have an ASN.1 serialization/deserialization method, this would allow us to ‘feed’ the GUI-description directly to the PostScript-engine… or to other GUI-frameworks. (The XER and JER encodings could also possibly, be used as a sort of intermediary between current XML and JSON descriptions — but the main thing here is to allow the description of the GUI-construction to be in the form that is best suited to the application at hand: whether that’s editing or sending across the wire for a light-client / server system.)  &gt;Personally, I blame popularity of JavaScript as the reason and tendency to push it everywhere all the time, even if it doesn't belong somewhere (Instill believe Electron is a stupid idea)  Honestly, Flash was a lot better than Electron. (I would argue it still is, but there’s a whole “newer is always better” continent in this industry.)  One of the big problems with JavaScript is the dynamic-typing and implicit-conversion: this disallows good type-checking; the historic lack of modules is also a huge detractor here; third, the lack of distribution… all of these combine together to make a language/environment that is honestly quite ill-suited to UI. (There’s no real VCL for JavaScript; though there was a VCL for the Web some years ago.) — The sort of thin-client idea previously mentioned could have events that fire ‘pre-server’, ‘on-server’, and ‘post-server’ thereby allowing for some easy distributed GUI/data-processing.  Anyway, just spitballing — I think your post deserves a more thought.
The Exorcist, it is not a horror movie, it is just a boring and awful movie. I can't get that Its IMDB score is so high. Why? If you like this movie, can you explain the reason?
Flying cars WILL exist because people won’t be driving them. Dogs will. I bet you thought I was gonna say robots, but that’s lame.
It depends. They mostly protect men who are the same as them. Any other man is "bad" in their eyes.  It's an old tactic to keep women away from the "others".   It's all projection.

I would suggest choosing something to work on in the Studio that could toss in some different aspects of development that you would like to learn. Even if it’s not the focus of the project, if you manage to have fun while you experiment with it, it’ll be very beneficial for expanding the capabilities you have.  You should try to take inspiration from things that interest you and attempt your best to use your current knowledge/what you're learning on the way to create something related to it. That way, even if you end up going through some rough patches of debugging, running out of ideas, etc., you'll have a greater chance at pushing through with the project and continuing to learn more from it since there would be an alternative form of motivation rather than solely based off of your desire to improve your development skills.  I'm not sure how much knowledge you have in terms of Studio/general coding languages, however, creating an obby could simultaneously help with design in addition to incorporating basic scripting elements into different stages. Here's some resources you could use:  #1. Written Resources   * Lua Handbook (ROBLOX uses version 5.1.4, so it would be [this reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/) that would most be in date with this. However, keep in mind that ROBLOX has modified it so it's more simplistic, so this may not be entirely useful.)  * [ROBLOX Developer Wiki](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/learn-roblox/all-tutorials) - The API is listed here as well as many smaller tutorials that can help at different levels of skill. (There also may be tutorials for building here, just in case you needed some help on that spectrum, however, I can’t entirely recall whether I’ve seen those or not.)  * [ROBLOX Developer Forum](https://devforum.roblox.com/) Tons of fantastic resources here, as the majority of even partially dedicated developers tend to go here for scripting, building, and general development help or discussion. The open source projects that members of the community provide could also be a good way to learn how things work, but most tend to be very advanced. This is a reallllyyyy good place to ask questions/get feedback on your work!  #2. Video Resources   * YOUTUBE! (Many fantastic tutorials can be found here that span a huge range of skill levels. [TheDevKing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2smVWjNGuRzD6HVWmlWwQ) is a pretty good place to go, as he has in-depth series for [beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhieaQmOk7nIfMZ1UmvKGPrwuwQVwAvFa) as well as for those who are more [advanced](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhieaQmOk7nIoGnFoACf33M3o0BOqB38a). Not sure if any of this is outdated, but [PeasPod/PeasFactory](https://www.youtube.com/user/PeasFactory/playlists) is classic one that was one of the earliest adopters when it came to good Studio tutorials. **I would suggest** at least **trying** to follow along with a YouTuber **to see if their teaching style matches** with **how YOU learn**. A big point to note would be that when you are learning something from a video, try and **cross reference** it with other YouTubers **to see the differences in how they explain it.** Take note that not everyone may go into as much depth with certain aspects of development when explaining/demonstrating what the video entails, so combining the knowledge from multiple sources may allow for a better understanding of certain concepts. This could allow you to get a more detailed/broader view as to different lenses that you could take when learning certain aspects of ROBLOX Studio. Other channels that are worth giving a go are: [Y3llow Mustang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEaBFdb9xUQjIB05HRG0cTw), [Okeanskiy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCch5yE-sVvh4OPB0kOxsGVg), and [Eppobot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAxoIRFhLUUcm3r3dGxHAew).  #3. Other Resources and Methods   * [Scripting Helpers Website](https://scriptinghelpers.org/) (This one is like an open forum where you can post questions in regards to scripting. One of the good things about this is that there tends to be a lot of basic questions that have been answered here in the past, which may be able to help with any common problems that you may face while learning how to code.)  * [Lua Learning](https://www.roblox.com/games/1334669864/Lua-Learning) (This is such an amazing game made by BoatBomber that is in the process of implementing lessons and quizzes that'll aide with scripting. Currently, its main use is the open source tutorials that users are able to publish to the game, which makes it almost like the ROBLOX Developer Wiki but from players instead.)  Hopefully these resources will be useful for you! Best of luck if you end up taking on the journey of development. It's a long process but can be worth it if you have enough patience and invest enough time into it.
in academia and outside sjw circles, the term cultural appropriation just means taking an aspect of a culture that is not yours. literally every culture ever has done it. ideas, art, music, types of clothing, etc. so yeah, hairstyles not part of your culture inspired by other cultures are absolutely cultural appropriation just by definition. but you’re also right that nobody owns braids. people just need to not be so sensitive and consider cultural appropriation to be a moral crime.

&gt; What if these people don’t give a fuck about anything?  They don't   And people "waste their energy defending it" because it's assholes and racism is ok so long as nonwhites perpetrate it.  Victimhood or woke outrage is fun. A shitload of fun. Division is fun, and it's somehow lost that people that justify this are often self-interested and have nothing real to lose when others' businesses are burnt, cars burnt, homes threatened - and others are murdered. Everyone is a fucking woke folk hero till death comes to their block.   Honestly, looting probably is, too.
I get depressed coming to this sub from all the pretty colors a lot of people grow. More depressed when some of you claim it's ok to eat from a tammed tub. SMH.  I built this to replace SABs, gloveboxes and any other sterile work space short of a true laminar flow hood. It uses a room size true HEPA filter available at Walmart Amazon and major drugstores. Think I got this one from Walmart online. It features a true HEPA filter to clean virtually all contaminants from the air. I payed $30 for the filter about 3-4 years ago.   All it is is a clear drawstring trash bag with 3 holes cut in it. 1 hole is sized for the face of the filter and ductaped in place.  2 slits are cut for arm holes then clear packing tape used to reinforce arm slits to prevent tearing from end of the cut. The drawstring opening allows easy loading and unloading. It is also adjusted for air pressure. You don't want it so inflated it takes away a flat bottom to work on.  To use, set it up, use 70% iso and spray the interior of the bag.  Spray your hands,forearms and the outside of everything you load into it. Lightly spray the inside again and plug it in.  Allow 15 mins or so for the filter to evap the iso and push the fumes out. Spray your hands and forearms again, stick them through the arm slits and go to work. I have done agar pours, transfers, innoculation, LC nocs, G2G, substrain isolation, or any other mycology work that requires a sterile work environment.  It has many benefits over SABs and gloveboxes and is just as cheap to build. In a SAB every time you remove your arm you create a vacuum which sucks dirty outside air in. With the PPAB(positive pressure air bag) clean filtered air continually blows out the openings in the bag preventing entrance of contaminants. I placed a bunch of dishes and a couple agar jars in the bag for the pic to show how much more room there is in the bag than any but a commercial glove box. Without your hands in gloves, your dexterity is improved and your hands don't sweat making long use comfortable.  If the rest of your sterile technique is crap, then this won't help much but if you biggest issue is keeping Tam out of agar and grain nocs, nothing beats this short of a flow hood that costs thousands of $$. On the other hand if your sterile technique is pretty good, this can reduce Tam rate drastically saving you all the time and money tammed jars/bags cost you. The filter will pay for its self quickly.  Nobody even the pros and scientists can grow completely Tam free, but using this, I have reduced Tam to less than 1% so out of 100 tubs I only lose less than 1 tub.  It has one drawback as far as I'm concerned. Flame sterilizing of scapels and loops are done outside the bag just in case there's left over alcohol fumes.  Feel free to ask any questions. Sterile work is easy and doesn't have to be expensive.

I'm not happy about it either. (Prior firefighter myself)   There is so much they are doing that is counter productive. I think it's largely antifa/alt-right instigating it, but that's just me, and people get offended by that view for some reason.
Did you really make a grammar mistake while calling someone out on grammar???
Looks like it's destined for the spice rack my friend. Don't get your hopes up.
No one is defending this incident at all, at least not publicly. Yet you hear the same shit over and over, to the point where it's infuriating. All cops are bastards, stuff like that or similar. What's annoying is yet I've seen people defending looting and rioting, as if it's an any way an appropriate response. Everyone agrees it is a terrible incident. Everyone agrees they should be punished. The problem is people react in different ways that have no correlation to the original event. Ex. looting, rioting, arson. We need to take action, but this isn't the kind of action we should take. How does a Target or an AutoZone kill a black man? It doesn't, yet those buildings have been looted and burnt down respectively.  I just don't understand this response to what is a tragic accident and should've never happened.
My favorite gaming moment is when I was playing the Sims and I was living in an apartment, so my neighbor came over to knock on my door to hang out, and while he did so his wife started cheating on him with some random guy, so I had to go knock on their door while he stood at mine to ask her to stop loudly woohooing while my children were trying to sleep, but then she came out in just a towel with a collar on............. and yelled at me for being "boring"  Thank you!!

In fairness that meme is more about blacks being 12% of population and doing 21% of violent crimes.  Meanwhile hispanics are 17% of population but only account for 14% of violent crimes. Whites are 62% 50%.  Of course socio-economic situations are entirely relevant but so is how you handle it.
Yeah. Look back at videos from then going crazy over nothing. Kind of similar to how people are going crazy now

Ultima Underworld came out in 1992. 1st person 3d environment, could look up and down and jump. Had ramps, bridges, angled walls, textured ceilings and floors, swinging doors, and simulated lighting. All this and it came out 2 months before Wolfenstein 3D. It's also a fun and clever RPG with NPCs, conversations, bartering, leveling, neat combat, rune based magic, and a really cool world and story. Of course to be fair: pretty sure it only ran on super beefy rigs of the day, only rendered on 40% of the screen (lots of filler with character panel and notification bar), and low framerates compared to id's masterpiece engines that ran smooth as butter on anything with a processor and full screen. Still. You don't see all those features I mentioned in one place again until several years later.

If they are militarizing the police anyway, why not abolish the police and enhance a group of MPs to act as civilian police?  Army soldiers acting under the Military code of conduct seems like it would be preferable to the Police atrocities and Police Union protections they abuse that we have now.

I did listen to all of it. Throwing out the line about a flat tire is a way to push off some of the relativit responsibility. Had he just said that he drove it in too hard and lost it, it would've been fine, but throwing in the bit about the tire is just a potential excuse.

I believe Unions are the dumbest thing any group can do, you can thank unions for driving the auto manufacturing industry out of Detroit into Mexico with their continuous frivolous demands. When children worked in coal mines and there wasn’t any regulations unions were useful and needed, now they serve only the laziest and drive down the very thing you unionized to protect. When a cop who murders someone in cold blood gets paid leave and still is eligible for pension the union is responsible because they negotiated for it. Unions allow collective groups to skate by and do the bare minimum for max pay to the detriment of everyone involved. You can thank unions for the useless bureaucracy of our government, incompetence is rewarded with cushy jobs because it’s impossible to fire a government employee. Teachers, firefighters, DMV workers, cops should be able to be fired, arrested, sent to jail just like anyone else for being bad at their jobs. In fact it should be far easier to remove a bad cop than a bad fast food employee because bad cops kill and hurt innocent people where a bad cashier at McDonalds mixes up an order. My mom is a teacher she tells me there are plenty of bad teachers doing the bare minimum for a pension because they know they can get away with it. That hurts society, until proven otherwise public servants should be stripped of unions. They serve the public, not the other way around.

“The first and biggest thing you need to make sure is not that you have your shot together, but that you aren’t spreading it to others.”   I wish more people understood this. I broke up with my ex who had cheated on me and as you can imagine I have a ton of baggage. I tried being with someone else way sooner than I should have and all I felt was guilt and anxiety and worry about the future.   I even sometimes brought my ex into that new thing I was starting... god it was so toxic and I couldn’t stand myself. I ended it.   I don’t want to bring sadness or pain to the relationship, I don’t want to create trust issues so early on... I am going to take appropriate healing time because I really do care about the other person and I don’t want to hurt them with my toxic negativity.

Woooooow.  So for the separation...you applied the glue and let it just sit for two hours?  Then heated the dry (cured) glue back up and adhered?
I think the worst part is that the ending just feels soooo rushed. Like I don't think anyone would mind if the relationship and character growth was more progressive rather than BAM I love you and we're getting married. The end

Is he saying the police fabricated information that was included in the police briefing given to the mayor and governor? How and why did the misinformation about out of state protesters get given to political officials?
You: “You're clearly not from the Seattle area, and it's obvious you can't even afford to live here.  I work at one of the nearby companies that you advocated should be destroyed and burned. How does it feel to know others pull in over half a million dollar compensation while your broke, pathetic, mentally-ill ass can hardly qualify for unemployment?  Now be a good dog and bark some more.”  The cognitive dissonance is terminal.

Honestly X doesn't seem like all that great of a person. She's got a boyfriend, everytime she hangs out with her friend and his gf (OP), he's always telling her how hot she is and how shit bf is and how she deservse someone else etc... And yet she remains friends with him and keeps subjecting her boyfriend to that? Maybe he's like OP and doesn't want to be that person to say anything, or he has insecurities. But X seems on the same level as OPs bf. She isn't stopping it, she isn't cutting ties, she isn't telling him to stop, she isn't defending her boyfriend (from what we've been told), and she subjects him to it by still hanging out...

The devs seems to want to put the efforts to polish and add things to the game. It's been getting fixes almost daily since launch. If the plug is not pulled early, it could become a great game. While i do enjoy playing Crucible, the game is very janky in it's current state.

What platform do you use
It's really incredible to think about the character assassination he underwent at the hands of Lost Causers. He was the most popular and famous American in the world by the time of his death - people considered him on par with Washington and Lincoln. Over 1.5 million people are estimated to have been at his funeral procession in NYC. Then came the Lost Cause and its stunning effectiveness at demolishing his historical reputation, which has only really been recovering in the past few decades.
maybe they will stop rioting if the govt stops oppressing them. it is not black people's fault America has been systematically oppressing them for centuries.

the only way in which you are remotely wrong in this situation is telling her it’s her fault. i’m sure she knew the dangers of going out and protesting but she chose to stand up for her beliefs. however just as she was exercising her right to protest it should be her responsibility to fix her situation.

Nice. Do you trade players? I haven't attempted that yet.
OP is mixed.  He can identify as he sees best but it’s wrong to say that he can’t identify as being mixed — when that is precisely what he is as a factual matter — just because he was raised to think that he was white.
You get one a game in each game, you can get it on 7 games. 3 are from Gen 3. (Pretty much nobody will trade stuff from Gen 3) 2 are from Gen 6 (Pretty easy) 2 are from Gen 7 (Same as Gen 6)
Every morning when I would normally struggle, I get on here and get involved. In the morning and at night before my shower. Then if its a particularly hard day I practice a form of mindfulness wherein I run drills. I sit in the shower under running water, cover my ears so I hear the water hit my head and focus on the sound and sensation. Then I notice my thoughts or feelings. Once I identifying one I don’t want, like arousal or lust, I disconnect from it and watch it float away in my mind. I stifle the response to act on it and just, observe it.. And then reject. I label it harmful and mentally push it away. I can feel this happening in my mind. If I’m having trouble ejecting it, I focus on the water until all my attention is on the sensation of the water hitting my head, and then back to the feeling. Push it away, feel it leave, back to the water. And so on. I finish with prayer. This community is awesome if you really get involved!

I played MWO extensively and am currently working through MW 5. IMO pgi gets an unfairly bad rep sometimes. They certainly do have their shortcomings, but overall they do a good job with core gameplay mechanics. The same holds true for MW 5, I get my mech fix while enjoying some fun gameplay that keeps me hooked. The random gen missions keep things interesting for me as well and the visuals are quite beautiful at times. There are some great mods that really polish up some of the things pgi fell short on, including AI behavior. I would recommend at full price, and def recommend at discount price! Start getting your stompy robot fix already!  Some of the mods I’d recommend are the AI fix, improved laser visuals, improved HUD, possibly the realistic velocity mod (although that may have unintended consequences with gameplay), among others. I’d look at the nexus mods page for MW 5 and find the most downloaded.
Glad you enjoyed 😘
There’s no another damn option, is it? Sunsetting + masterworking being so f grindy is a joke.
I vibe with this
Lmao it was a tracer round. A paintball. This person was doing something wrong to be marked for arrest. The cop couldn't shoot her eye if he even tried. The accuracy on them is shit. Stop being so dramatic.
Yes, until such time as the case is further along.

Depending on your device you can too
&gt; Seriously why do they believe this kind of shit why do they refuse to admit there's a racism problem with cops why is everything a false flag.  Because it would require them to realize that their "side" is wrong, full of racists, and is fine with state-sanctioned murder.  Then they'd have to feel bad about that.  Performing mental gymnastics to avoid that is their way of avoiding the issue, and it's tiring.
OK, I'll break the full narrative down for you.  The mining company went ahead with the operation because it was legal for them to do so, despite them knowing full well that it was a rather awful thing to do.  I pointed out that an actions legal status does not always line up with wider society's view on that action. This is because laws are not always as comprehensive as they should be, and there are cadres of people who's profession is to find (or create!) the loopholes in the law which allow morally questionable behavior to not be prohibited by law.  You implied that if conservatives - presumably members of the U.S. conservative party, although I could be mistaken there - knew this (namely, that legality and morality do not always line up) they would start "advocating for slavery" as you put it.  This is where I saw a disconnect and became confused, hence my statement. Slavery is not legal, and hasn't been for over 150 years, at least in the US; longer in other countries. Even the most hard core of modern conservatives would be hard pressed to morally justify that slavery is moral. Regardless, that position is a flip-side of mine. My statement is that something which is legal is not necessarily moral. The "supposed" conservative position you implied was that something which is **il**legal is not necessarily **im**moral.  Legality and morality do not always line up. Some illegal things are *not* immoral (i.e. homosexuality in many places), and some legal things *are* immoral (i.e. blowing up a 46,000 year old Australian Aboriginal site). But I find the latter case to often be the more dangerous, if only because that is the case most likely to be exploited by extremely powerful entities (such as corporations) to the detriment of many.
Burning down minority owned businesses  Setting houses on fire with children inside  Robbing stores  Yea, really noble motivations.  I’m so mad about being repressed I’m going to kill some kids and go to target and get a free tv.  It’s an excuse to steal and participate in violence.
dodge dead zone is .8, aerial sensitivity is 1.4 (I’ve been experimenting a bit with that) my controller dead zone is .2, no vibration and everything else is default. also find more people to play with, more competitively if you don’t want to lose as much. it’d probably be better overall so you can play with friends but also maybe get a slightly higher rank that you would like to be in
Never too old
Honestly I get it. In the past whenever I checked prices for those games they were usually very high. I was honestly shocked when I saw them for below $20, as in the past I have seen them usually go for $50
I for one actually want to stop stuff like this. There’s a problem with society where they over value things like large dicks, and it makes no sense, as it’s harmful and there’s not much value to them. I would love to change how society views dick size, and I would love to help stop the body shaming that smaller dicked fellows go through. I’m sorry for the loss of your friend, and this is something that really needs to change. I hope one day society can change, and I’ll play my part. Until then I hope you find what you are looking for.
It's our fucking park. Do we pay taxes out the ass, increasing every year, to be "allowed" to walk in it? No. Go walk in your park.  Like I said, if you think walking in the park is something the government should be allowed to tell you when and where you can do it, you are part of the problem. The protests are not just about police brutality, it's about the "state" as we know it as a whole.  Excuse the phrase, but at some point people need to grow some balls and stand up for themselves.
sameeee day month year is so much easier and logical... but then again i am a canadian raised on the british system looool

As far as I know, HRT cannot/will not move fat. It will cause new fat to be deposited differently, and this combined with the loss of fat through diet and exercise is how much of the body shape changes happen.  The HRT will not help you lose weight, and it won’t make your existing fat look different.
Yes

Point me to one protest that started off with looting and rioting. I have been following Minneapolis, LA, Memphis, Atlanta, Denver, and Washington DC closely, and been aware of the rest. Find me a situation where the police escalated after the looting started

So far from what I've seen Matthews, Nylander, Marner, and Rielly reposted the [Nike video](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/business/nike-dont-do-it-message-trnd/index.html). Rielly also reposted a [quote from Masai Ujiri](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA3OFbXBEUp/) that the Score posted.  They might not have the same gift for words that Wheeler does, but there's no doubt that they're lending their support.

Make a double boiler to melt the butter and then infuse it maybe? Idk much :(
Google it, it is your country my dear.
Just because, for some reason, this needs to be said: just because the news aired the mayor or police chief saying something DOESNT make it true. They said this 12 hours after the protests. There's no way they know one way or another at this point. According to elected officials, everyone is travelling to a different state to participate in riots away from their home states or cities. It's nice and warm to say "our people didn't do this, it was someone else." The media loves it, people that don't want to believe people are pissed off love it, the older generation loves it.

Also, and it's not a huge plus, she was also acting polite (maybe not the right word). She wasn't exploding at OP or anything, just complaining on facebook, which others were then telling OP.

This is true. My SM told me that directive is coming down next week to have individual meetings with all partners and give ya 3 options.   1. Stay on but with drastically reduced hours  2. Go on LOA until September, keep your benefits and be eligible for unemployment with a “guaranteed job to come back to in September”  Or  3. Quit with a small severance package  He told me none of that is for sure yet and he will be getting official details on Monday but he was pretty certain it is going to be very similar to the above 3 options.
Well... my political opinions have gone completely haywire in the past few years. I was about 16 when kap began protesting and it was also during trump's election. During that election cycle I began to invest myself in politics and found myself becoming a "MAGA dude". So naturally, I wasnt a fan of the protest.  Unrelated to what's been occurring the past few days, but I've done more research and kindve studies both sides and have decided that Republicans and Democrats are two sides of awful and the government sucks at everything. So, I completely changed my support for Kap and people should be allowed to kneel for the anthem. (That being said I do believe Kap is asking for too much money to come back.)  My thoughts on the past few days: I truly believe there two different sides of Protesters and Rioters. I think weve grouped them together. If you are rooting I dont necessarily blame you, but if you try to loot someplace and get shot by the owner of that store, that is your fault and justified.  Protestors keep on protesting
Lol yes these are the BEST scenes
It’s almost like it works like any other social media website and reddit just likes to claim superiority for no reason but to feel a false sense greatness.

Reddit liberal debate flowchart:  1. Did I win with logical arguments (unlikely)? If NO, proceed to step 2.  2. Accuse opponent of "Arguing in bad faith", "Gaslighting" or "Sea lioning".  3. Throw in some ad-hominems, appealing to group think (it's hard to think on your own)  4. Pat self on back

You need a knife (or a knife made from two stones). It's a bit silly that you can't cut up a chicken with an axe (or machete in your case), but no you need a knife.  Stand over it with knife in hand and R2. You'll end up with two fillets and a pile of bones.  To cook you will need:  Short stick (if you don't have matches) - harvested from small shrubs (walk up to shrub empty handed and R2 until the tree falls.  Long stick (for cooking fillets) - harvested from small trees in same way as above  Bark (again if you don't have matches) - walk up to big tree with knife in hand and R2  Logs (best if you have an axe but quite often using your hands on the right trees will produce logs - some of the smaller firs are best for giving logs)  Bandages or paper  To make fire:  Open inventory and put short stick in hand. Navigate to bandages or paper and hit circle (combine). This will automatically exit you from the inventory. Tap R2 followed by hold R2. This will build the start of a fire. If you have matches just take them to your hand and old R2 while looking at fire.  If you don't have matches put small stick in your hand and combine with bark. Tap R2 then hold R2 (this will make a fire starter). Take the fire starter to your hand, look at fire and hold R2.  You should now have a burning fire.  Open inventory and move (hold X on item) the logs over to the 'fuel' section of your fire (if the fire isn't in your vicinity it won't show up in inventory)  Take long stick to hand then highlight uncooked fillet and hit triangle. This will put the fillet on the stick. Look at the fire and hold R2. Your character will sit down and hold chicken in fire. Wait until it turns dark brown, open inventory, then navigate to the cooked chicken below the stick in your hand and square to add it to inventory.  Repeat with the other fillet. Fires burn longer now and I reckon you could cook about six chicken fillets with one fire.
Mine does that sometimes too...she's 12 months. She does it when she doesn't get her way - like, today, I wouldn't let her climb the stairs, or play in the toilet. I was super concerned at first but now I recognize it as separate from her ACTUAL hurting cry (like the time she tripped over her feet and fell awkwardly onto her wooden blocks)

&gt;TFA was the best and had a solid found in ton and start to am exciting trilogy that really went down hill thanks in part to Rian Johnson.  Alternate take: TFA was the source of many of the trilogy's worst problems and everything going downhill is JJ Abrams fault.

If you're using the words "better" to compare any one of the two, you have an issue. It's not police destroying innocent lives and looting stores out there. That's way worse than whatever some douchebag cops do.

Yeah me too, but they won't.

Yeah do it however you want, just start doing it. Put the music on quietly you'll be fine. Just make it a habit to turn off your mind and focus in on what it is you desire, feel you have it. And when you come out of your meditation don't be a "double sided man" realize you did what was ask of you and have faith that it is done.
Ich glaube es wäre vielleicht effektiver wenn man solche Kommentare nicht löschen würde, denn die Leute die diese Kommentare posten denken meist dass sie sehr viele Befürworter ihrer Theorien hätten, ich glaube es wäre weit effektiver ihnen zu zeigen dass dies nicht der Fall ist. Ich glaube es würde mehr bringen ihn einfach zu sagen dass sie blöd sind und mit ihrer Meinung alleine dastehen statt sie zu blockieren. Ich weiß genug über solche Leute um zu wissen, dass sie wenn sie blockiert werden denken sie liegen richtig mit dem was sie gesagt haben.  Wenn ein Schüler Mist baut und von der Lehrerin rausgeworfen wird fühlt er sich möglicherweise cool, wenn ihn aber alle anderen anmachen er sollen nicht den Unterricht stören ist das eine weitaus effektivere Methode.  wenn du merkst dass die Mehrheit der Menschen um dich herum dir nicht zustimmt lastet auf dir einfach ein größerer Druck dich zu ändern.

No. Old white rich people being and staying in charge is the issue. Read up. The black leaders in the 60s organized peaceful protests in areas where racist (future trump supporting) pieces of shit were the sheriff/governor/general population were racist and would use violence to silence. Only when this shock and awe campaign happened did a marginal amount of change take place. Yes. If you support trump, I think you should die, rot in jail, or just have every penny stripped from you so you can see the pain and injustice that has been felt from generations of your ancestors bad choices. You dumb fucking ignorant piece of shit.
That is absolutely beautiful. I can’t wait for mine to grow up to be that size!
This depends an awful lot on who you are. If your random Joe Schmo than sure maybe you're right but if you are a member of the police this kind of situation forces you to take a stand or your silence takes the side of the oppressor
I think it is normalized. Shows like Cops don't exist in many countries.
True. I'm on the student schedule, summer starts in my world as soon as the spring semester ends (early May)
Nah, she is trash.  And even G3 is not really worth it unless you already modded both AR and 404 girls but then you have no need for her anymore...

You know what side they’re on. It rhymes with Dwight Supremacists.
There is no benefit to the presence of a police force in my community. The police only make people scared here. We're fine on our own.  Communities should be permitted to handle things on their own without outsiders who wield too much power with little to no oversight or consequence.
My friend I am sorry to tell you this but we kind of bullied away flat earthers on reddit.

That’s what I thought, it’s so big here so I wanted to see if other people learned about it as well. Pretty much anything we learn over here is about wars (Revolutionary, Civil War, Spanish-American, WW1 and 2, Cold War, Vietnam, etc.).

If you are in USA, the people that are probably going to harass you will likely be Trump supporters. So... wear a Trump supporter shirt???? Unfortunately, I think many people will just be ignorant and see that you are Asian and assume Chinese. Hopefully you don't get any trouble. ㅠㅠ

Last post was deleted due to subreddit rules so I fixed it
I think you missed the entire point of this post. The changes take time. And time devoted to the engine takes time away from game and actual content, which will also lead to player frustration. It's not an easy process by any means.
Once this player did that with an intel case in the sky, and kept doing it over and over again. Even after we shot it down they were still able to keep it up there.
Thank you for the offer.  I'm planning on keeping them.  I'll just keep trimming the edges of the grip tape as it shifts.
Yeah. No instagram, no cool.

Then you get in.

Lol cool you can take all of our rioters for free
Idk if that's a mistake. She's supposed to be dumb. Maybe it was scripted
I’m still praying for either an HD remake or a proper sequel. I loved everything about that game, from the B-Movie Aesthetics and references, to the creature designs (especially that giant plant monster boss), to all the map Easter eggs (alien ufo tsunami!) That game is still easily in my top 10 favorite games of all time.

Being blunt, I think it isn't the greatest way to introduce a channel. It's well made, don't get me wrong, but if I were a viewer clicking on your channel for the first time I would want a taste of your content rather to an explanation of what you do. Idk, just my opinion, but try to implement your personality a bit more. Also, try to be a bit more subtle about ushering people to subscribe. Give them a real reason to. Keep creating!
Yes please 😍😍

There is beginning to be continuity across sero surveys showing an IFR of about a percent. Yeah, it kills old people but those people are still part of a population, so factor into the IFR.
That last line was perfect. "That uniform doesn't make him a robot, just like your skin color doesn't make you a criminal".
Wait til they find out what sweaty teenage ninja asshole actually tastes like.   Thus could end a lot of perversions.
They literally chose him lol
Nah, I totally agree with you! If this guy can lure the public in with his social following/looks and then proceed to educate them on health information. I am all for it!
My sleep patterns are forever fucked now.  I get frequent headaches.  My anxiety is through the roof, certain self destructive behaviors came back.  After the first (and so far only) discard I had a nervous breakdown.  My health absolutely has suffered, I'm not the person I was before him.
Awesome!
HUZZAH!
Also that’s not literally what you said in your first post. Maybe you should learn to read or maybe learn what the word literally means. Anywho, I don’t think you even read my long comment because you can’t fathom someone having a clear and concise thought that isn’t the same as yours. Well I tried to have adult and civilized conversations with another left winger and again the ending was the same, insults and no facts.  Also I think I won the bingo game 😉. Good luck with your future bullshit callouts.
Probably an arraignment hearing.
What’s the source? I tried to google “vice reporter beaten George Floyd” and found nothing. I’m not trying to question validity, I just want to be able to cite the video before I share it.

Got really lucky and was able to get in at Chipotle warming up the tortillas
What about the San Andreas fault line finally going off.
Not anti Americanism, it's just that it's been a rough time and people want to take it slow for now, imagine a second lockdown. Specially Italy, they had a bad time and only recently managed to control things. Let's not have a second wave of this.
Get rid of the beaver. No realistic depictions on flags!!  I like F or C. I think the ideas could be combined, actually. Start with C, but change the wheel color to white. Now it's representative of mountains. Then change the color on the side of the flag to the right of the wheel that yellow color. Now it represents the desert.
Call the police and get him put into a behavioral health facility. He is not safe and is a danger to himself and others. You cannot do this on your own.  The status quo is not working for him or you.
do it if you're allowed to where you live, but probably adhere to social distancing to some degree
Read up on how bad the USO. It also trades futures contracts and what it holds is a mystery. Garbage on a shit stick.
Gravity guns weren't a thing until Zarya now? You can say some things are similar but that's a reach.
Good, they're afraid
I’m new to knives.   What’s the big hole at the end of the Spyderco for (not the hole in the blade).
I think you're right. I'm working on recognizing that my best is going to look different than a lot of other people's best, I've been getting psyched out reading other people's baselines that are higher than my 5-weeks into dedicated score lol.  Thank you for the response :)

You're naive if you think humans who had less education and opportunities than you deserve to "live in a cage".  Who raised you? You're so privileged if you even thought you had the right to throw people in cages.
should be charcoal, not coal since these riots are prob gonna go on for even longer
This game has gotten so toxic :( It makes me so sad.

I know multiple people in Minneapolis and they have all verified that those highways are completely closed and blocked. Also the sight-line in that area is very clear and it would be impossible to miss seeing the protesters long before the driver actually slowed down.   So even if for some reason an exit was missed and not blockaded, no way a driver didn't notice something was up driving on an empty highway at 5PM, and no way they didn't see the protesters way before.
Oh I'm not saying that the immersion isn't the main point of this game, but my observation is that what distinguishes X4 from games like elite dangerous and no man's sky is the empire-building. Your empire has a very real impact on your environment. It isn't just another sim game. But the management of the empire seems to get progressively more tedious, to the point where a varied fleet composition is tedious to maintain, and you end up with a fleet of 100 nemesis sentinels with plasma, which is neither fun nor immersive, merely convenient to replenish.
Who is against the queen of pop will die!!!
Committing an offense so egregious that even a secluded community of pacifistic Luddites hear about it and let their opposition to it be known publicly says a lot about how effed this situation is.
How much do you have left? I’ll buy a bunch
Maybe you were having a stroke then. That second sentence is hard to get through.
toss a coin to your witcher!!!
Ok, I see what you're saying. It's just crazy to me what these 2 guys are doing in their 2nd year in the league. Trae Young is having a similar season to the Harden MVP season (stat wise). And Luka is doing even better. One of the craziest draft classes if all goes well
It is the true successor to MvC3, warts and all. I enjoy it but newbie and competitive games all seem to boil down to finding an opening for a ridiculously powerful combo and then just waiting to make sure no inputs are dropped.  &amp;#x200B;  Its fun to play but I generally prefer something with more of an SF-style damage model and anime movement (Under Night!) and competitively prefer to watch either Tekken or Guilty Gear
Well shit, I don't know whether to up or down you now.
Plankings back in lads.
Remember those morons that tried to bully people in school?  That's where they end up.  The trash of society. Paid thugs for the oligarchs.

nvidea card bug, go on control panel and set the 3d setting to let the 3d application decide
i trust you chickenshits as much as i trust the cops, you're both cowards who do nothing in the face of pure evil but despise the only people in this country who give a fuck. the only thing you'll ever do for a protester is shoot them in the back.
Yeah. The mVolk one seems easier funnily enough.
I feel like the flowers are prettier than making a bunch of paths and stuff. My flowers are my pride and joy.

Thank you!  I was confused, because my qualifying listings were still getting calculated at 9.15%.  I didn't realize the 10% discount for qualifying listings only appears on the invoice.
You can be pro riots and protest and anti looting. I’m sure MLK Jr. would be angered at people taking advantage of this to steal TVs and games consoles
Not a rule breaking post... bitch this ain't even a meme
This looks perfect! I’m in love with the style and textures
That wasn't even an accurate English sentence.
Didn't skip the celebration directly because i was stunned that it worked that well. Afterwards i skipped without watching any replay.

Most of the time they are misunderstandings caused by our different languages and cultures.  I think I would be mostly in the wrong about things when I am feeling a little bit insecure
Started my own business.
Accurate is pretty simple to operate (compared to SAP), but most of the time need lots of manual record to support accounting documentation (like fixed asset and prepayment listing).  This is from auditor perspective.  I'll recommend full spec'ed SAP for $100 million asset companies.  But don't change system.of it's currently sufficient and working.
I like the theme, however the three are all quite similar to each other
So.. is this the trailer for the Joker 2, it looks way better than the first one. So realistic.
