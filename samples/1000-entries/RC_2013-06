&gt;I also don't consider myself an "antifeminist" because I have feminist friends and that would mean I'm anti-them or what they do.  This is literally "I can't be a racist, I have black friends". How did you not see the fallacious reasoning when writing that?

considering that it was the community and not the devs or the parents that pushed for this, it's pretty safe to assume that the community isnt going to rally behind every copycat that comes along and it will be a self policing issue of concern.   but if 50 little girls that play MWO all die of cancer, i'd be okay with 50 tribute mechs in their honor. You can "worry" about such a horrible thing all you like, but i'll still think it's a pretty lame thing to be worrying about.   also, what concern is it to you or me if PGI wants to "worry" about that issue? You didnt explain how it could be a bad thing other than "PGI might hurt someone's feelings". slippery slope is slippery, and not even really a slope.

Look, cuteman. You are obviously not responding logically to what I'm saying. How the hell is  &gt; Yes which is exactly why communication between cars and the network is necessary-- you need as much information and sensor bandwidth as possible.  logically connected to:   &gt; You can't rely on driverless cars communicating with each other for critical information like distance from each other for a simple reason: there will be a long (decades) transition period where not all (or even most) cars are driverless, and there will always be obstacles on roads that are not enabled with wireless communication.   It isn't, you're just making blanket statements that are sort of true but don't connect to the original point. Enjoy being condescending and wrong, I'm done wasting my time.
Its a nonsensical comparison. But do what you want.   Slut shaming is just being an asshole to people who enjoy sex.   Bitching about being friendzoned is just a result of a girl not being attracted to you and you feeling like because you were nice you are entitled to touch her. That means you were nice to touch her. Which means you are fucking creepy. The only reason a 'nice guy' gets 'friendzoned' is because the woman could tell he wasn't genuine about being nice or shes just not attracted to him.   Think about it. If you are really a nice guy, you aren't nice just so you can fuck someone. You are genuinely nice and don't care if someone doesn't want a sexual relationship with you.   Theres a reason women often think nice guys are creeps, because well, those who get mad about being friendzoned are creeps. 
I once collected the 3/4 of the curse deck into my own deck in Dominion and won with the fewest negative points (I opted for card destruction instead of defense cards). When the curse deck ran out, my card destruction still functioned, while everyone else's defense cards had become worthless.

I think you slightly misunderstood what I mean by "all it can do" (through no fault of your own, my phrasing was ambiguous). It was meant to be understood as "the best it can do". I think that settles most of the disagreement we were having.  Then again, as pointed out elsewhere, it's not exactly likely that, when a government mandates behavior that goes against the moral compass of the individuals, the people will act according to law and not morality. In other words, the government may have enacted some racist laws, but that doesn't mean it made the situation any worse than it could have been: no person *became* racist after the laws were put in place. Laws can't force people to be bad, but they can force them to be tolerant.   &gt;This is not an indictment of government, but of all organizations. Every time you have some form of organization, the nature of the beast is for the primary goal of said organization (be it good governance, to breast cancer research, anything) immediately becomes the secondary goal of the organization, second to the maintenance of the organization and its power/authority/existence (based on the premise that the organization itself is necessary to achieve that goal).  It is quite possible, and it has happened, that the secondary goal of the organization aligns with the primary, or aligns with progressive moral ideals. For example, the Democratic party has for years used catering to various minorities as a mainstay of their political message: progressivism is the key to their continued relevance. Sure, it may not be *honest*, but that's not strictly relevant.

Because Sion is really the epitome of a sucessful and well-defined/established champion. If you have skills that are only useful when you play the champion in a specific way, it's always as if you had one skill less, which sucks, especially considering some top lane champions nowadays have 7 skills level 4 onwards.

What the IT guys behind the VPN can see it's up to them. They can't access your files (unless you share them) if that's what you are afraid off.

As a general rule: while working on a provided IT infrastructur, assume IT can see everything you do. (most likely they won't)

I've always thought owners that did stuff like this have a kinda shitty business sense. You could do sealed events $50-a-seat which is the equivalent of selling boxes for $300 (Right? I think boxes are 36 packs, but it's been a very long time since I opened one). You lose money for prize support (say, 1 box in prize support per 50 people?) but more than make it up when 150 people come to your sealed event, buy your overpriced drinks and oatmeal cookies, buy some cards on the side, tell their friends how awesome your shop is, and continue to support your business in the future.
Woman in pink "Hello? -*tap tap*- These doors are locked."
I'm not sure that sounds enjoyable to me. But I had a dog that did the same thing, go out and run around the yard at full speed while grabbing mouths full of grass here and there and then puking them back up.   EDIT. I got curious about why pets eat grass and did some googling and came up with this answer.   "   *  Cats use grass as a laxative to enable them to pass hairballs lodged in their intestines.  - Cats eat grass to make them vomit up hairballs.  - Cats eat grass because they are feeling sick and this makes them vomit, getting rid of poisons.  - Cats eat grass to relieve inflammation of their throats.  - Cats eat grass to relieve stomach ache.  - Cats eat grass to add roughage to their diets.  One explanation for your cat's craving for grass is that in their wild hunting days (cats evolved from the wild cat, a long line of hunters) they normally ate the entire animal when they caught it. Many of their “kills” were herbivores (plant eaters), and cats ended up eating a lot of grass and plants that were in the stomachs and intestines of these animals.  Some people believe that cats eat grass for the raw nutrition their diets lack. They instinctively chew and eat grass to obtain the vitamins, minerals and live enzymes provided by fresh, raw whole foods. The ideal diet of fresh meat, grains and vegetables they once enjoyed in the wild has been replaced by one that often lacks these nutrients.  Others believe that eating grass plays a medicinal role in that it helps to relieve digestive problems. When cats are vomiting or have diarrhea, it is not uncommon to see them grazing away on the lawn. However, while eating some grass may help your cat's digestion, too much can make matters worse. Blades of grass often have edges that are irritating to the stomach and your cat will vomit a few minutes after eating."

That makes sense, but you can watch most network TV shows on their websites the day after or in some cases a couple days later.

Those are pretty few and far between on their official sites.

Even if it was Heath Slater or some other skinny white guy that Sheamus was feuding with, there would still be a problem. Lots of little kids look up to Sheamus, and him bullying other people is only going to reinforce the idea that bullying is OK. All I was getting at is that Henry being fat and black doesn't help that. Speaking as a former fat kid, other kids don't need much fuel to think it's OK to bully those that are different from them.

If they are suffering from any type of disease and/or have a low quality of life (that is subjective depending on the individual) and are consenting adults, then go right ahead. Granted they are not the bread winner for their family or have dependents of course. If their death does not harm anyone else then I see no reason why someone shouldn't be able to go through with it.  Obviously they should have to go through some psychological evaluations to make sure they aren't just going through an episode and that they truly desire to die for whatever reason that may be.

You'll notice the buttons on Michael and George Michael's shirts are on the left side in that scene, when buttons on a man's shirt are normally on the right side.  In fact, in the next scene, you can see Michael wearing the same shirt outside of GM's home with the buttons on the normal side.  It seems they filmed in the same model home, but flipped it all across the Y axis. Also, in an attempt to disguise it a bit, they are wearing special shirts for those scenes.  The pockets on Michael's and George Michael's shirts stay on the left side, but the buttons switch sides.

I was working as an intern at a tiny recording studio in Nashville and one afternoon a guy came in and asked to see the studio owner and the head engineer. I asked his name and he just said John. I went and quietly poked my head into the studio while they were between takes, and told the engineer that there was "a little short guy named John at the desk". Engineer looked confused, so I decided to continue with "and he looks like he has pubes for hair..." he laughed and stood up to come out, and when I turned around, I realized John was right behind me. I kind of awkwardly apologized without looking him the eyes, and the engineer steps out and says "Oh! evalou0! Has anyone introduced you to Mr. Oates yet?" I shook his hand, muttered "nice to meet you" and basically sprinted back to the desk. They talked for a few minutes, and as he's heading out the door, he turns to me and says, "you know, you could probably benefit from a new hair style too" and laughed as he walked out.   Edit: I thought of another one! I go to the tattoo and horror convention in downtown Nashville every year, and I have a few friends that work audio at the Middle Tn Anime Convention (they have been in the same building the last few years). 2 years ago, one of the MTAC guys told me that he met Norman Reedus, who had a booth at the tattoo con and had been walking around both conventions in a very easily identifiable mask all weekend. The next day, I was waiting in the line for something (can't remember what) and lo and behold, here comes Norman Reedus in his mask. He walked right by me, and I leaned out of the line, stopped him, and whispered "I know who you are" as creepily as I could, just trying to be funny. He pretends to start hyperventilating and literally runs away. Later, I get to the booth where he's signing things and taking photos, and I go to take a picture with him. He's joking with the person taking the picture, and suddenly turns and whispers right in my ear, so no one else would hear him, "And I know who you are.. I know everything about you.." and starts laughing maniacally. (Then I got a hug and a kiss on the forehead, but I'm just including that because it was the best thing ever.. haha)  Edit, part 2: One more, then I swear I'm done. At the same tattoo convention last year, I accidentally stole $10 from Sid Haig. (Captain Spaulding!) This man is one of my favorite actors, I love him, and I was so nervous. He was charging $10 for a photo and an autograph, so while I giggled like a moron, I pulled a ten out of my purse and went to get a picture with him. I giggled like a moron some more, thanked him, and walked away, only to realize I still had the ten in my hand. The line was long and I didn't want to interrupt someone else, so I just walked away. That night, I went to a midnight showing of Devil's Rejects where he did a Q&amp;A with Bill Moseley (Otis!) and sat in the front row. Sid even sat in the middle of my group for a few minutes. I went back the next day when the convention was coming to a close, and there he was at his booth, but this time no line. I walked up, and he goes "Hey best friend" I freaked out because he recognized me.. then bought him a beer and told him it was to make up for the $10. He cracked a joke about how it's never smart to rob a clown, and I decided I could die happy.
why does this get downvoted?
That I hate one of his dogs and that I pity his outlook on life. I love him like a brother, but it really gets to me.

Didn't say you were bud.  I think you are taking this a little too seriously.  I don't think I am a "freak".  Maybe to others I am, but I consider myself pretty boringly normal.  I don't see tons of "freaks" running rampant in the streets here either.  Yet, I don't actually feel the need to debate the labeling of the East Coast of the United States as "freaks" in a picture posted in /r/funny on Reddit.  Lighten up.  I'm sure a little in-breeding will relieve your stress.

Regardless of any social taboo, I hear ya!  But I was 30. I remember talking to mom and her friend Elaine, my GF's mom actually, and a sexy lady.  Somehow oral sex came up.  Mom says, That's fine for a man, but I don't see what it does for a woman.  I said to Elaine, you take this one, I just remembered I have something else to do!

There was a This American Life podcast years ago about an undercover going into a mosque and pestering these three muslim dudes about Al Queda. Anyway, those three guys tell Hussam Ayloush, a community leader with FBI connections, and he informs the FBI, who acts nonchalantly about the whole thing.  So the FBI removes their guy, but then charges one of the guys who reported the undercover with conspiracy to commit terrorism because he didn't report him fast enough, and because one of his sisters is married to a man that the government considers a terrorist. So the FBI tells this guy that he either has to work for them as an undercover in Pakistan, or their going to charge him with conspiracy to commit terror attacks.  So the government then charges the guy for not disclosing that his sister is married to a terrorists, though who knows how one is supposed to know that someone is classified as a terrorist. The undercover then lies under oath to say that this guy was planning on committing terror attacks, thus making him a danger of the community, so he could be locked up indefinitely during his trial. The charges are eventually dropped, and now no one in the mosque talks to FBI agents anymore.  NYPD does the same shit, btw.

This is just a personal anecdote, but my alertness and ability to concentrate has improved significantly since I began taking a B multivitamin.  EDIT: And my pee is really really yellow.
I'll share my "burning bush" experience:  The first time I ever drove through Kansas was at night and I reached a magnificent lightning storm (no rain.. yet). There was so much lightning I turned off my headlights and could see even better than if they were on. I hadn't seen any cars for 20 minutes so I pulled over into the right shoulder and literally started dancing on Hwy 400/ Hwy 69. It was awesome. It was just me and The Man. Nobody passed by, but if anyone did I undoubtedly would have looked like a maniac.  I was praising God and called Him a show off. Seriously, I could see the rain miles away with all the lightning! (I wish I had pics). But eventually it was time to go. I knew this because I literally heard Him say "Time to go." (It wasn't the first time I've heard Him talk so it wasn't weird). But I didn't want to go. The show was too cool and, plus, I didn't see any rain or danger of staying. He said "Seriously, it's time for you to go." Like a child leaving an amusement park I begrudgingly agreed. RIGHT as I closed my door the torrent of rain hit.  May not be anything compared to having the Red Seas pushed back and crossing on dry land, but certainly something that left me thinking "You definitely *are* up there." Not to mention He know me *so* well that my stubbornness would be an issue.  That's *my* God.  May not be what you were looking for, but I can't think of anything else (that I can draw from personal experience) at the moment.
You can tell he's up to *something* but not necessarily the villain of the movie. Also, you need to treat people with more respect. Just then you were insulting for no good reason. Do you realize how obnoxious you sounded?  Well, let me tell you, judging from that comment you have a venomous, unpleasant personality. You and people around you would be a lot better off if you'd improve your disposition. 
that's my problem. I've tried just hard coding in coordinates that I know an Actor will be at, but it still returns null.

That's 250 over 3 years.  Chivas Guadalajara signed an exclusive contract with Univision last year worth more than $50 million dollars per year just last year.  Leon got a $12 million dollar a year contract from Telemundo. The MLS signed a new deal with NBC, but it still nowhere near anything the Liga MX is pulling as a whole.  The MLS gets about 27 million right now for their 3 contracts.  The MLS is still stuck in the 200 - 250 k viewer plateau while the Liga MX averages about double that number, and the numbers rise because of the playoffs. The problem is that the MLS has never been able to connect with the 40 million plus Latinos in the US, specially Mexicans &amp; Mexican Americans who still prefer the Liga MX.

When we put my DS onto 27mg Concerta, his symptoms also got worse.  We upped it to 36mg and they were under control then.  I've seen other commentators say that if the dosage for Concerta is too low, it can sometimes make ADHD symptoms worse, rather than lead to a partial improvement.

Hahahaha, yes! Thank you! 
I do like the idea of a rare mob destroying a wall in an attempt to pathfind to the player (maybe resulting it its death before it can reaching that point), but this would only be possible if an ongoing change in difficulty was implemented, and in a building game would be an annoyance that doesn't enhance game experience, but just makes the player annoyed that their shelter disappeared for no reason.  It could only work if it was a predetermined point in time when this would happen, so you could defend against a full-out siege rather than one very random kamikaze attack that would lead to confusion.
Fucking exactly my point. Thank you.

Surprisingly, a person can vape daily and have a high tolerance to vaping/smoking, but a low tolerance with edibles. For your first time using AVB, I'd use anywhere between .5 - 1 tablespoon worth of finely ground AVB. The finer the grind that the bud is, the more surface area is exposed leading to max absorption when it hits your small intestine.  Also, I'd recommend mixing the AVB into something other than a frosty. OP is using yogurt and that's a great way to eat it. it masks the AVB taste and texture very well.
yes, do it little by little. first for a few hours outside, then overnight, and then you should be safe :)
I'll check the bios version.  Thanks for the suggestion!

Always remember that for "normal" people who do not smoke all the time, the first thing they assume when they see someone acting funny is NOT that they're stoned! Half the paranoia comes from you thinking that everyone knows you are high, but in reality it's usually not the case. Play it cool

I agree with all of this.  ...but I don't need a seriously binding contract to keep myself or my wife faithful.  If you're doing the right things, you don't need a contract at all.  Maybe the problem here is that people are relying on the system (and oh what a gloriously fucked up system it is!) to show them the way, rather than learning for themselves what makes a marriage work.
Or the subtler sarcastic approach: "So I see the cat's bowel movements are as they always have been..."

I actually like pepsi a lot as well. I particularly prefer them in fast food establishments.  The quality of coke products from the fountain varies so wildly. It'll have no carbonation, too little syrup. Don't even get me started on how bad all the sodas taste that come from the coke Freestyle machines.   I go to a place with pepsi, and it's usually the same. Even their dr pepper is more consistently good than dr pepper is on the coke machines.  The only issue I ever have with the pepsi ones is being a bit flat, but pepsi still has had this issue less than coke IMO.
I WILL TYPE THIS IN CAPS SO YOU UNDERSTAND IT. YOU ARE A PEDANT ASSHOLE AND NOBODY ELSE HERE IS STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK HE WAS ACTUALLY SAYING THE CHARACTER WAS SARAH PALIN AS OPPOSED TO A PARODY OF HER. YOU ARE AS DUMB AS A STUMP AND THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ROLL THEIR EYES WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.
Here's my take  Face primer doesn't have the "stick" that eyelid primer does. It's meant more to smooth you out and blur flaws, plus give a little bit of hold.  Eyelid primers are a lot of "stick", maybe a little smoothing(?), and usually give you a lighter base so the pigment shows up more.   Could you use a face primer on your lids? I imagine yes. But it won't give you nearly the results that an eye primer would. 
I concur.
I don't know. I see what you are saying, but I think there are plenty of ideological wars in addition to the economic ones, regardless of who is in power.   I agree that it seems less likely than before when X royal family had ties with Y royal family and agreed to attack Z because of an assassination. But that being said, I feel like much of that stability has come from a world superpower hegemony which has trade and flow of money as one of its number one priorities. If that hegemony were to leave, I could see the next one to step up being just as concerned with money. But I could also see there being much higher tensions if the world became more of a regional superpower deal with no one country being the real, military superpower. For example, if the US had no influence in the far East I could see things being more troubled between China and Japan, South Korea and North Korea, etc. 
THIS makes sense.  I see that part of the appeal is from what others infer or fill in, things that are implicit rather than explicit.  Great job of describing it, because I know SW fans can't all be crazy;  unfortunately, SW3 was such a kid-friendly vehicle that bordered on the ridiculous.  Dark Skywalker was a win.  Furry teddy bears winning against Storm Troopers?  Not so much.  Boba Fett's "death"?  Not at all justified.
nothing, its not clever or funny but it's true

I live in a LARGE college city(the school has 70,000 students, probably half at least on the main campus I'm at), and our city is part of this horrible mess of Phoenix and several other cities, so that certainly could be it.
I touched a piece of five thousand year old pottery. It felt like history.
I agree that factors such as poverty should be addressed. But you can't ignore the fact that people are judged on superficialities such as skin color. There should, of course, be a balance. Additionally, society never improved with people saying "that's the way things are." Women's and blacks' rights were never achieved with that mindset. Maybe when blacks and other URMs achieve parity with whites, AA will become obsolete. Again, it's not perfect--it needs to be improved so SE status is considered along with race. But you shouldn't just address one factor at the expense of another. 
...what?
LOUD NOISES
I really appreciate the concern, but trust me when I say that he's not in such bad health that the SPCA would get involved.   I was a vet tech for a while, and seeing dogs like my sister's is unfortunately normal. A lot of people have dogs with bad allergies, but don't want to buy the expensive veterinary diets and are too stubborn to shop anywhere but a grocery store for dog food.   Unfortunately, vets and local animal authorities want to make sure that animals are being fed, watered, kept under a roof and aren't writhing in pain. They can't force you to do anything to make them lose weight (unless they're extremely obese), or get their skin and eyes back to normal.

&gt;You reported me for "man hating" and had your mensrights loser mod ban me from advice animals, instead of allowing you little cunts to brigade me all day while i couldn't reply I just deleted them.

That happened.

I have been very grateful to Erdogan's administration as they have been leaders in extending recognition to the present transitional government in Mogadishu. They have been a part of intelligent aid programs and Erdogan went to visit, actually going beyond the airport as well. so that  For what its worth I think the current administration has done a pretty good job of imposing itself as its own entity with its own interests that are, for the most part, independent of other states. I'm not sure I agree with the American Lackey accusation although the economic aspect seems pretty accurate.   In regards to Syria, not that i approve, but Turkey's involvement could easily be portrayed as consistent with R2P considering the current environment.

I guess its due to her invisibility and therefore extreme roaming strength both as mid and as a jungler.  In both lanes she can be a massive threat and not only create a lot of kills/burn summoners but also forces the already gold starved enemy support to buy pinks or force their lanes to play very passively since shes able to ignore sight wards. Also still has some pretty good initiation and pretty strong burst damage lategame and a pretty good farming spell on her Q. She still loses a lot of matchups mid and has some drawbacks as jungler but the unsafetiness is deadly especially in soloQ.

Google Maps or any kind of internet maps.   In my hometown, I'd look up an address in the phone book, then flip to the map section to see where it was if I wasn't familiar with the streets.

And let me tell you....as a general rule, **people fucking suck** at giving directions

I am fully vaccinated, as are all of my children, so you can see where I lie on the subject.  However, we've done public health a disservice by representing vaccines as zero risk. ** Vaccines are not without risk.** The risk should be properly disclosed (perhaps even compared to other daily activities like flying) so people can make informed decisions.  Unfortunately I had to do my own research on the actual risk percentages and had to normalize the numbers myself.  Each vaccine carries its own profile of negative reactions and the combination vaccines are even harder since it doesn't appear that statistics are kept on what reactions are brought on by what portion of the combination. I can totally understand how someone would feel this is a public health/CDC/pharma/government conspiracy because it feels like people don't want you to know the real numbers.  However, never attribute to malice that which can be explained by mere incompetence.

I'd agree that about 90% of the times that Koreans have painted their face black it has been a racist use. I'm not disputing that. Boweruk asked  &gt;but I just don't understand how painting your face black is racist?  That's **not** by definition "mockery of a person for their race". It doesn't have to be used in that matter. Has it been used that way in Korean media most of the time? Definitely.

I get that you're probably trolling or at least an angry nerd that thinks statistics "r srs biznes" and should be the final authority on something as arbitrary as a "grade" for academic performance.

Yes my bills are paid, but at the cost of working 12 hour days 5-6 days a week, and working from home a significant amount as well. im a 10%, purely by virtue that I work myself as hard as two people. how the hell does it make sense to punish me for working harder?

 Mutations are what make evolution happen....if mutations add information then evolution adds information because mutation is the thing which powers evolution using natural selection.

You're accepting that 1+1 = two, but not that 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 7. 2 is possible but 7 is not. Ridiculous.

We don't know what's going on here, either. Speaking of Provinces/Territories: do they have their own North vs. South equivalent? Am I ignorant?
"Diner's on me tonight, boys!"
To add to this- Consistency will tend to vary with ovulation- thicker when you're not in your fertile time, much thinner and runnier during fertility. More like the white of an egg yolk. so don't fret too much about changes in the thickness unless accompanied by other symptoms!
It's because most Subways are owned by incredibly cheap immigrants who spent their life savings to move to America, pay the $50k franchise fee and open their little store. They have to buy those (overpriced) pickles from Subway, and every one you don't eat is one they don't have to buy.
Well this is awkward.....

I want to add one quick thing here. I'm sorry I can't post more proof. The methods I'm using to monitor Coachella will be compromised if I tell you guys exactly how I know. Let me say this though - I have NOTHING to gain by getting Coachella420 banned again except to help you people. I have never once done business with Coachella, I have no reason to "get back at him". I'm upset I let my guard down and didn't realize in time to stop the InfiniteSource scam. This time I caught him in time and I'm trying to minimize the damage he will inevitably cause again. If you choose to heed my warning or not makes no difference to me, you have the information I can provide and the choice is yours. Much love to my fellow SilkRoaders. 
...yea i know and im real sorry and all but..  *shoots his head up and kisses her again anyway much longer than before*
Then you are wrong sir. But that's cool, do what you do.
But why
Fun fact: we don't get exactly 50% of our genes from both parents due in part to the mechanism that we only receive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from our mothers.   How this pertains to Doppelgangers... mtDNA could be used to map the lineage of both parties and measure the "distance" between their heritages. (called ancestry mapping, see [here](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/humanmigration.shtml)) For example, I remember a front page post about a half-black/half-white guy and a (middle eastern?) guy that were perfect doubles. Ancestry mapping of these two would (most likely) show they are from very lineages.  I know this doesn't come close to answering OP's question, but it is something that could be done using existing methods and databases. And because studies have already been done (sorry, no sources, maybe later), all it would take is a sample from each to be compared to the existing datasets.

GOD DAMN IT.  You've got awesome hair and beard and skin. I keep repeating this over and over because so many red heads come here asking if they're ugly: I think red hair, freckles, and the skin type are really attractive.  Not every time, but lots of the time.  This whole ginger thing is a fucked up Internet meme gone haywire. And you look good in the suit, too. And your FACE.  It's FINE.  *Not ugly.*  Edit: If the ladies ask you what you do, tell them you defeat men in symbolic warfare.

yes ill stick to beer, haha i find that liquor makes me sleepy but beer helps me be social x) thnx
I tend to agree.  Face to face, no surprises, etc, I'm fairly confident I could take a single 70-90lb dog in a life-or-death fight. I'd be fucked up for sure, but I have 4 bludgeoning tools, 10 eye gouging implements and a mouth full of teeth versus just a mouthful full of teeth.  If I'm allowed to use a weapon (even just a brick), it would be no contest.   The exception is an Akita.  I would not fuck with a dog bred to hunt bears in the mountains.
There was a lot of eating out this week with my sister in town and my mom going and buying food and then bringing it back home.  But I'll suggest albondigas.  It's a Mexican soup with meatballs and veggies.  The meatballs I use ground beef, finely chopped cilantro, onions and garlic, salt, black pepper, and brown rice, formed into a golf sized ball.  Light boil in water (or veggie stock) with onions, cilantro and mint leaves.  After about 35 minutes, add in veggies (cucumber, zucchini, carrots, celery, any others you like) for 10 minutes.  Time for me to reflect on Sprint 2:  * *Reading - I wana get through Emotional Freedom and Will I Ever Be Good Enough? completely and continue with my Anxiety workbook.* * I finished the *Will I Ever Be Good Enough?* but then read other books (*Food Rules* and currently on *In Defense of Food*).  Didn't touch my anxiety workbook.  * *Jogging - I'm on the fence but I think I'm going to run outside since the weather is nice and it's not burning summer hot yet.  Thus I don't think I'll be doing C25K anymore.  Gotta think about this more.*  * Well I worked on getting over the anxiety of running outside, had a person say something to me while out jogging, and restarted C25K on W2 outside.  I'll be continuing this next round.  * *Social - Got a couple baseball games planned and found out the library has free passes to awesome museums all around.  Plus as the weather becomes nicer, more parks are having events and even free ones. :D Got a couple events I want to check out in May.* * I did go to a three baseball games, a museum (by myself too!) and a board game night.  I have to utilize the free museum passes more.  * *Exercise - Continue working out every day, remember to incorporate yoga on upper body days and meditation on lower body days.* * This wasn't consistent again either.  Must work on making exercise consistent!  * *Jog searching front - Do that reading therapist gave me and delve into that.*   * I did do the work sheet and I also went to a résumé and interview workshop, went to a job fair, and went to the career center to sign up for services.  * *Weight - A long-term goal set last Dec was to be 180 lbs by June 3 which might be possible.  That's a big might.  But I'm aiming for losing 4 pounds this sprint.*  * I'll weigh on Sunday so I'll see how much I lost.  I'm creating my sprint 3 goals but they'll be pretty similar to the previous sprints.  **Today's Goals**  * Walk - DONE  * Therapy - DONE  * Meditation - DONE  * Reading - DONE  * Library (work on résumé, log pedometer/fito, 90DG reflect Sprint 2, plan Sprint 3) - DONE  * Watch baseball on tv - Postponed so double header tomorrow :)  * C25K W2D3 - DONE; even tho I have a headache. I'm pretty sure cause it's been cold and today is hot and I'm dehydrated.   * Lower Body Exercises  * 10-minutes cleaning desk 
Aw no it's all good man, sarcasm doesn't carry over text very well!

I've tried to reply to this post a couple of times now, and I've come up with nothing.  There just isn't many things I'd do for a Klondike bar.  I don't like Klondike bars all that much.  Maybe if the outer casing of chocolate wasn't so thin. I take a bite and it all falls off leaving me trying to hold this broken melting bar of vanilla ice cream. All the cracking and melting makes me thing about the polar ice caps and the how those poor polar bears that Klondike uses as their mascot are being split apart by the breaking of glaciers.

Its all situational. At lower ratings doing baron is pretty much a sure fire way to force a fight as most teams will be too dumb to just give it up and keep turtleing.  If that doesn't work you can either split push, dive them on the turret, or just siege and poke until the tower finally dies. All three are viable options but you have to pick the right one based on the game situation which isn't always easy.
Depends on what sound you are after. Their amps are deliberately very plain and vanilla sounding.  They keep the signal as close to original as they can because they want you to use their amp modeling and effects.
Well the easiest way the break cement is to use a jackhammer. Now here is where most people make the mistake of thinking a jackhammer would break them apart. WRONG! Jack hammers use a hard tip thrusting forward and back to break hard cement apart, and as we all know most people are only semi-firm at most. Therefore the easiest way to break up people is to use some kind of object that is not too hard but not too soft of both of them, preferably in a forward and back motion.

"Unfortunately there are some people who base their opinions on misconceptions rather than the facts," Buchanan said, noting that 75 percent of Walmart managers started as hourly employees. "Every month more than 60 percent of Americans shop at Walmart and we are proud to help them save money on what they want and need to build better lives for themselves and their families. We provide a range of jobs -- from people starting out stocking shelves to Ph.D.’s in engineering and finance. We provide education assistance and skill training and, most of all, a chance to move up in the ranks."  - she just used statistics to her advantage in a corporate tirade. "75% of managers started out as hourly employees" - most people at a manager skill level aren't looking to go there so they promote the successful within. Congrats. That makes a low wage look better. Hi would you like to make 15 dollars an hour as a manager instead of 8? Regardless of the situation that person would say yes. Now, someone working at a medical practice making 14.50 an hour... is not going to be interested in that.   "More than 60% of Americans shop here every month" - well considering you've closed most mom and pop shops, and regional stores are barely hanging on, it makes sense when you have a non membership store (aka free) that offers low Prices (on something's)  "Range of jobs" - we have a lot of one and one of the other.   The last sentence is just bullshit sprinkles.

The University that I attend has a very successful resume writer that owns her own business, writes a column in the local news paper and works at the University helping students write resumes.

I think if you want to experience the "AFTERPARTY" experience, check out the Masquerade Rave Saturday Night in the Sails Pavilion. It is such a blast.   I think you'll be fine, its a damn safe place.

&gt;if you say, well, OK, I don't believe in God, there's no evidence of God, then you're missing the stars in the sky, and you're missing the sunrises and sunsets, and you're missing the fact that bees pollinate all these crops and keep us alive and the way that everything seems to work together at the same time.  Fuck. Off.
Yes, but not everyone is as adaptable. I got hired for perl and was able to very quickly pick up PHP. I would even help some less capable devs try and solve problems in langauges I had never used. My boss did everything he could to keep me around because he saw it as being a fairly rare trait in developers.  It really comes down to how a person learned to program. Some like myself who are self taught have had to learn the hard way through experience basic concepts of programming, but learn it in such a way that it's easily adaptable. School taught programmers learn concepts through rote practice and implementation and have a harder time applying those same concepts to anything else.  I also don't consider it an intellect thing either. One of the programmers I worked with was better in C than I was because of his experience, but his expertise was in networking. He was like a fish out of water in trying to do anything other than C or bash.  TL;DR: I would compare the differences in programming languages to be akin to the differences between a handsaw, a chainsaw, and a table saw. Just because you can trim wood in a workshop doesn't mean you're qualified to be a lumberjack.

I totally agree with you. My favorite fish was a feeder Goldfish bought for .15 from Walmart. Bugger lived through several moves and my inexperienced fish keeping care. I loved that guy just as much as my cat or dog. He died after 9 years :( surprisingly long for the conditions I subjected him to over the years. It makes me so sad to see these fish treated so inhumanely.

In California, the loan terms and interests rates are set by the state and are significantly more affordable than payday advances. Interest is only due every 4 months.   Pawning/selling your items may be unwise for some people financially, but for others it's the difference between eating this month or not. Often, they've made other poor financial decisions that put them into a position where they need to pawn or sell their goods - that is not my fault. I'm just here to help if I can.  If you have the time and means to sell the items yourself, then go for it - my feelings won't be hurt. However, if you need cash today and don't mind paying me a modest interest rate, than I am more than happy to help.  A lot of people would rather have $5 today than $10 a week from today, it's just a fact of life. I am not here to judge people on their financial decisions or to determine what is or isn't wise for them. Until you're in their position, you can't really say either.  One day, you too may find yourself in a position where pawning your precious metals is your only viable option of getting a loan and you may find your tune has changed.  
I'd just like to tell you that while psychiatry works for a lot of people, medicine does not necessarily constitute "real help."  There is a lot of trial and error, and a risk that things can get worse (sometimes just temporarily at first, sometimes just because the particular drug is not meant for you chemically).  So don't feel too bad about your parents preventing you from getting meds, because honestly I started taking meds when I was 14 and I think it caused more problems than it helped.  That's not to say don't get that type of help if it's for you, but don't worry about it if you can't access it.  Sometimes exercise is the answer, or finding a hobby you like to sink your time into.  And "the answer" is a fallacy because it doesn't necessarily just "stop."  But it's as much trial and error as therapy and medicine, so try those things while you can.  Maybe the prayer will work, even if that's not what you believe.  At least try to appreciate that they care, even if it's in their own way and that's not your way.  Suicidal thoughts are like a storm you have to wait out.  There's always the chance you could screw up if you try and end up living with worse problems.  There will be better days and worse days, but wait out the storm and know that there is a reason to experience more days.
I don't think you can just say the weather is horrible. Just because it isn't sun 24/7 doesn't mean we hate it. I love winter and I'm not sure I could go a year without snow. Summer also gets pretty hot and there are plenty of lakes with beaches if you want that type of thing.

Dude you gotta chill out. We can't just piss off people who deserve it because they're pricks, that doesn't solve the problems. As naive and silly as it is, we need to get those people on our side to have progress. Progress comes from broad social reforms, not just revolutions where we put one group down and raise another. Sure I fucking hate the capitalists, racists, misogynists, nationalists, cops, rapists, Christian fundies, fascists, and bosses but if we just piss them off instead of changing people's views and having the left over assholes die off and become the minority, those assholes will just fuck us over again and again. And don't focus on just fucking around with me, go after the real assholes who are fucking you and everyone else over. And by the fucking way, I'm not against any of those revolts or anything. I made a basic statement on the interweb so calm yourself. You don't need to prove anything to me. Also, you keep talking to me like I am a pacifist, which I have not once said I was. You are the kind of overly aggressive "FUCK ALL OF YOU" pricks that give people who want change like us a bad name.

One of my good friends got proposed to in front of the wishing well at Disneyland. I was squeeing so hard when I found out.

&gt; Turn that around. You have no issue forcing northern-Irish Protestants into a distinctly catholic Ireland but can't justify forcing catholic northern-Irish into the UK? I don't think it's fair to characterize the UK as a distinctly protestant state. From my visits, it seems quite secular.  I don't want to force anyone into a sectarian state. The main reason I abhor Northern Ireland is because it is structurally sectarian. I wish to 'force' northern Protestants into a secular state, which would not oppress them nor allow them to oppress others.  The 'UK' is not distinctly protestant (although the Church of England is an established church, and has special representation in parliament). However, 'Northern Ireland' as a state within the UK is perhaps the most sectarian state in the first world. Protestants march through catholic areas celebrating victories over catholics, schools are segregated, all the main members of the unionists parties are members of the devoutly anti-catholic 'Orange Order'.   My family are 'protestants' (though southern, not northern protestants), and I have family living in the north. You only truly realise the nature of the northern state when you watch grown men marching down a road, banging a drum so hard that blood runs from their hands, and screaming bigoted chants so long and loud that their voices are hoarse for days after.  &gt; ...secular, non-sectarian, socialist Irish state. This exists where exactly? Certainly not on Earth. But, no, even in the case that such a state existed, I could not justify forcing a region to join it if the majority were against it.  My greatest wish, greater than my desire to unite Ireland, is to turn Ireland into a socialist and secular state. I plan to achieve that end, hopefully before any new developments in terms of the North. Because a secular and socialist state based upon the whole of the island is the only choice that will guarantee permanent peace, and allow true reconciliation and heal the divide.  &gt; Here's a question: Why does the catholic-Irish minority in Northern Ireland matter more in determining what nation Northern Ireland will be a part of then the protestant-Irish majority in Northern Ireland?  The catholic minority don't matter more: that's exactly the point. I don't wish to single any group out for special treatment. Why does the protestant minority on the island of Ireland get the special ability to determine what state the section of the island they live on is part of?

I can answer with tangents. I have an Easy Reader and a different Seiko 5. I paid roughly double for the Seiko than what I paid for the Timex, and to me, it's totally worth it. It's nicer, quieter, smoother, automatic (mechanical nerd points if you like that sort of thing). Seiko reliability and accuracy will stand up to timex. Just realize you have to be ready to set the Seiko every time.   FWIW, I bought another, older Seiko soon after my first, because they are rad.   Edit: my watch was smothering me. 
&gt; Ironic, because legislating people's behavior is pretending that racism doesn't exist.  And?  What the racist tree proposes is that pretending you arn't racist is what causes people to actually not be racist.  The idea is that sure the current generation is just forced to not be racist.  But if the generation that is next is brought up being told that racism is wrong since birth, then they will likely believe racism is truly wrong.   Most of your post seems to go on the assumption that 'faking' not being racist is useless, when in actually 'fake it till you make it' is a legitimate way of solving the problem because we are so easily socially inculcated.

sorry replied to wrong comment, meant to reply to CDBSB above you
I love this counter-argument, because it so clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of the scientific principle. There are no "facts" in science, that's an extremely common misconception and only further shows your ignorance of the entire matter. You've clearly never seriously researched the debate, or if you did, barely scratched the surface.  No single observation is valid, so they must be repeated over and over, until there is virtually no doubt about their accuracy. No scientific theory ever asserts the truth of anything, it only offers increasingly more accurate models of the universe.  The only thing a scientist has "faith" in is the scientific method, which makes a whole hell of a lot more sense than a piece of historical fiction.  The most important thing about the scientific perspective is that it recognizes that we will never have a "right" answer, only the best answer given the existing information. Religion requires you to throw out any critical thought regarding its principles, and accept it on faith.  If there's only thing you get from my post, please let it be this: science, unlike religion, cannot and will not ever claim "truth". Science can only positively show things to be false.

I think, judging by the 13 out of 25 spots on the page now occupied by lispm, that it's a misguided attempt to seem 'fair' while still doing his damnedest to keep his obsession front and center.

Brand New is pop punk as far as I'm concerned for the same reason that Coheed and Cambria is post hardcore as far as I'm concerned-  Both of their debut albums are staples of the respective genres. They get free passes for life. Jesus Christ isn't "a pop punk song" but Brand New is  pop punk. They're relevant enough to be posted here.   I apply sort of the same logic to Fall Out Boy although their newer material is a much more radical departure: They've paid their dues. Maybe songs like Light Em Up are a bit harder to justify posting here but FOB news and tour info etc. will always be relevant to fans of pop punk.  Not allowing some wiggle room and letting in neighboring styles of music would mean pigeonholing this subreddit and becoming monotonous and boring.

You're missing my point. All I hear from europeans is how awful and worthy of condemnation the invasion of Iraq was... and who stood up for what's right? Did anybody care to raise even an eyebrow to us? Nope. Everyone just averted their gaze.  That's what happens when you give up your own power. You become less than a formality. Personally, it pisses me off as an American, because I believe our government needs limits, and the rest of the world is turning it into a monster by failing to set any limits.

Titans arent low DPS, they are just less likely to be used for dps  For example, a levi can reach or 18.3k dps, or 20.6k overheated  A blinged moros can reach 19.1k dps overheated, and a nyx 12.5k dps  However, this isnt the role of a titan, and those lows are usually used for PDSs or armor tank, severely reducing the DPS.

Well, they are hired for the purpose of, and are specifically authorized to, make decisions and interact with customers on behalf of the entire organization. That sounds like they're representing their corporation to me. Acting or communicating on behalf of a group has been referred to as "representing" that group for as long as I've been alive, at least.
I wish I had a midget porn star double. 
Whenever I see that other group of 6, they have tons of fun. I keep hearing that that one girl really opened up and is alot less shy now. This is kinda weird for me, why would this happend after 3 periods? I don't speak to these people nearly as much as I would like to. When I see them I say hi, when we have a thing with the whole study I go to them, but I feel I am drifting away from this group. I felt closer to these people than anyone in high school, but this is becomming less, and I really don't want this to happen. I try to stay in contact with some people I like the most, I want to text them, but again, I just don't know what about. I recently found out 3 guys and that girl are going on vacation together this summer. Ofcouse I would love to go with them, especially with this girl, but 2 of the 3 other guys and I don't get along that well. Maybe it is because I get the feeling that they both (used to) like this girl in the same way I do. From one guy this was pretty obious, although he recently told me he didn't like this girl, even though I'm sure he used to. These three guys get along together very well, they want on short vacations together several times, and on school they hang out together. A thing that is bothering me, a lot, is that they are going to the house of the parent of this girl in Germany. I can't get the thought out of my head that they are just bringing her with them so they can stay in her house, even though they really aren't these kind of people. Maybe I'm just upset that they are going on vacation with here, but I just can't get this thought out of my head. The other guy of the three is a great guy, he is one of the few people where I get the feeling that he is trying to be my friend. This whole vacation thing is probably bothering me way too much, but I just can’t get it out of my head. Am I just jealous? I get the feeling that I am scared that this girl will have a horrible holiday, even though this is probably not the case, all three of the guys can get along with here pretty nice. The one guy from who I get the feeling that he liked her though is bothering me though. He is kind of a dick. He is making fun of other people (maybe me more than others, maybe not) just to feel good about himself. I know at least 2 other people from our group feel the same way, but he still is the ‘’main guy’’ of the group. Maybe I’m just scared that he will take this girl away from me, I just don’t know. My holiday will probably be awful again by the way, parent, again, no friends to go with.  I guess the main story is that I just always feel left out of everything. I get a group of people that I hang around with, but they still really don’t feel like friends. I also would really love to have a girlfriend, you may say that it isn’t a problem to not have one when you are 18, but I kinda feel like it is. I just feel more and more alone and left out, I don’t want this anymore.   TL;DR: (I think one is in his place) I just want someone to tell this story to, but in real life.

Delata V can be compared to potential energy. Except it's the potential propulsion when weight is factored in. For example, if you were to hack a nuclear engine and a large orange fuel tank into orbit, it would have a lot of dV. But, if you throw on 5 more orange tanks, the dV will increase, but it will take FOREVER to get anywhere because of the inertia of the "rocket". If you replaced the efficient nuclear engine with an inefficient but extremely powerful mainsail engine (over 20x thrust of nuclear engine) it would have less dV but would be able to go relatively fast.

I've been on both ends of this issue, and I think it is typically a case of friends growing apart. In a friendship, each party has certain expectations out of the friendship. Such expectations may arise from where they 'rank' the friend among their other friends. So for example, if you consider one friend among your '6-7 closest friends' but they consider you a tier two friend, then you guys may have different expectations. When your expectations are not met (e.g., to hang out, talk on the phone, help you move, provide comfort during difficult times, be a good wing-man on a night out, etc.), you may wonder if you are growing apart, or if your expectations need to be changed.  Alternatively, both parties may rank each other similarly (e.g., both consider each other to be best friends), but what each party expects out of such a friendship may nevertheless be different.  It's complex. You're not going to end a close friendship or change it dramatically because your friend bailed out on you once. But a pattern of such behavior will make you reconsider.  I guess open communication helps in such situations, and I think the poster to whom you are responding just wants open, candid communication about the situation rather than subtle hints or passive-aggressive behavior. But I can see how open, candid communication can be difficult. I think I have an conflict avoidant personality, and I'm the guy who will always say yes and then half the time back out with an excuse because I don't have the heart to tell you to your face that I'd rather not hang out with you / I have other priorities. So I can understand where that comes from. But still, in such situations, I feel like an asshole. I think open communication is the best way to go.
Also, take off any armor. You'll need the speed boost.
Oh don't get me wrong, I am "Science, bitches" down to the ground. (In fact I'm waiting on the mark for my masters in Bio :D). My dad once told me he wondered if it was unhealthy that I wasn't afraid of the dark or anything because it could possibly get me into trouble (was living in Australia at the time, so the fauna I was watching and prodding could have been lethal if my parents didn't have hawk eyes on me).   I was just entertaining the hypothetical situation where nobody knew that movies were fake (and we are assuming here that for some reason nobody would rationalise it out). Obviously some movies would be more unsettling than others but the reason I have never felt scared in a movie is because I always have that disconnect between fiction and reality, in addition to a solid grounding in science and logic...remove that and I could see some things depicteed in movies being more than a little unsettling, particularly those which would turn science on its head.   Nukes are pretty terrible things, horrifying really, I know they should be terrifying and yet I have never *felt* afraid of them. I guess that is largely down to growing up in an era when no nation has seriously pointed them at each other and the horrific bombing of Japan is a footnote in a book and something that even my dad was too young to remember. Actually it surprises me how 'well' mutually assured destruction seems to have worked because no nation has pushed far enough with another to get to the point of pushing buttons. You have me at genocidal mobs though, or any kind of out of control mob. That side of human nature really is terrifying to think about.

Some quick things at first glance:  * Queens much sooner, at most wait till your hatch finishes, the earlier you have the queens the better.  * This terran One-Based a long time. Normally this means early aggression. So a third base would not be advisable. If the push would have come sooner, you would have nothing to defend. So stay better stay on 2 base and drone up and make a decently sized army before you take a third. This also helps you to maintain map control (something you never really had in this game) and keep him in the base, preventing him from taking his natural as long as possible. This also allows you to go to Lair much sooner, allowing for things like mutas, infestors, baneling speed and +2/+2 upgrades.  * BANELINGS! You scouted his marine heavy play and never made a baneling nest. Instead you made a roach warren. Why? Against that many marines banelings are much more (cost) efficient. Even with pure lings and blings, if you had used the lings to trap and then simply run the banes into his marines, you would have destroyed his push easily.  * When you get mutas in this situation, you should never use them directly against the marines. Mass marine will shred through mutas, even in bigger numbers. What you want to do with mutas: harass his mineral line (he had no turrets and no expansion when you had quite some mutas ready), cut off reinforcements and/or tanks in the back of its army. Only when you have a massive amount of lings/blings and he has only marines and medivacs left (maybe some few tanks) I would fly my mutas into his army (always together with my lings/blings
I'm presupposing based on his basketball experience during the 06-08 years. He was on a better team in a different situation. There is no doubt about that. How would Crawford do on a team like that?

I've been listening to a lot of 2012 music this year, and will probably spend next year listening to a fair bit of 2013 music.

First of all, IANAL, and I'm simply speculating as to what such legal precedence might be.  As I've mentioned in other posts, any liability would be dependent on the legal concept of negligence.  Negligence is, "a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances".  Essentially, it hinges entirely on whether or not a parent made a reasonable effort to do what is expected of them. It could be strongly argued that getting your child vaccinated is not only extremely common, but expected of most parents unless there are extenuating circumstances.  So, if a parent has not done their due diligence in having their child vaccinated -- or officially exempt based on medical grounds such as a compromised immune system of allergy to the vaccine --, then the parent could be considered negligent if their failure to do what was reasonably expected of them.  If however, a child who was vaccinated still gets sick with something they were vaccinated for, which in turn causes another child to get sick, then the parent of the vaccinated child would not be considered negligent. The reason behind this is because the parent carried out their due diligence in meeting the societal expectation that they vaccinate their child. They have taken reasonable effort to attempt to mitigate risk.  To clarify things a little more, if such a precedence were to be set, it would be likely that it would only pertain to diseases in which we commonly vaccinate children for. Obscure vaccinations, or diseases that have no vaccinations, would not be included in such.
As a non-smoker I definitely welcome this but how are they going to enforce this escapes me.

I've come to the conclusion that he does indeed want to leave, he wouldn't be talking this much if he didn't.  He's being pretty disrespectful to the club by talking up how much he'd like to play for Madrid and how he couldn't turn them down, I know reporters are asking him but he doesn't have to give the sort of answers he's giving.  He's complaining about the press lying about him but here he is again giving them something to write about, he's giving ambiguous answers to questions about his future which is only fueling the speculation. He could have simply dismissed the questions or at least say he doesn't want to comment but he's not doing that, he's giving the answers he's given for a reason, he's not naive, he knows how the press are going to pick up on it.  He's saying all this after the club stood by him through so much, he dragged the clubs name through the dirt numerous times yet the club defended him, and here he is now talking up another team in another league. If he didn't want to leave he would have kept his mouth shut.  If he had said he want's to play for titles then I'd understand, but his media excuse is bullshit. If he goes to Spain he's going to get the same coverage he get's here when he does something controversial, same as well if he ends up in Italy where it's even worse.  I'd love for him to stay, he's a phenomenal talent, adds so much unpredictability to the side and would be extremely difficult to replace. On one hand I'm hoping a lot of this is miscommunication and isn't as big a deal as we think, but on the other, my respect for him is starting to be chipped at.  I was in the Kop when he bit Ivanovic and on the way back to the bus I heard someone in the group I was with say we might have just seen his last goal and game (I didn't see the incident so I hadn't a fucking clue what he meant until a while after) little did I know how close to being true it could be.
It actually wouldn take that many years to get out of the debt US has, if they cut the Military Budget by that amount.  then after the debt has been repaid. they should funnel some of it into NASA imo. Get some space exploration and research going.

Derren Brown:  I used to work in casinos and he knows a guy who runs fun casinos for corporate events.  Sometimes casino staff would do some work on the side.  One of my colleagues ended up in one of his shows, an early one where he was pretending to be in a casino memorising blackjack cards and things (he recently got barred from a club in the UK for playing BJ, which I think was a bit much and possibly a publicity stunt).  So they had a fake casino set up in some hotel or something, and he filmed a few shots for the opening, explaining how he could beat the odds and such.  He turns to my colleague on a blackjack table and says, "Okay, do whatever it is you do when you're about to start a game of blackjack".  So, obviously, she shuffled the cards (what else are you going to do before dealing a game?).  Derren freaks out, "WAIT!  What are you doing?!".  She shrugged, "Er, shuffling up?"  Derren sends everyone out of the room and makes them wait for a while before coming back in.  Obviously he had memorised the deck as he had set it up (probably with some specific story for the cards to memorise the pattern, easier than memorising a random set), so he had to reset them.  When they came back in he said, "Okay, *apart* from shuffling, do the rest of what you do...", so she put them in the shoe and the rest you can see in the episode as filmed.  I dealt roulette to him once (in a real casino).  He wore a brown suit and played brown chips.  Won a fiver
Man that was weird. 
Can someone explain me why they wouldnt be allowed to compete next year?
Sorry u/thereisathingforthat I meant female friends. But this wasn't what ended the relationship but I did feel somewhat resentful that I couldn't hang out with a good friend. The only difference between my situation was that we were already quite good friends.
I know its Nazir but my iPod doesn't recognise any of the names as words so it autocorrects to nazeem because I've used that one enough times for it to accept it as a word.

Decent article, but the title set me up for something more "epic" than what I experienced reading it.
yeah, it is because of insecurity and thats fucking ok. he has good reason to be insecure. there is so much that can go wrong. with him, his emotions and with her and her emotions.   it can screw him in his head and fuck up their marriage. yeah, i know its a shocking thought that its ok for a man to be insecure about something.

I tip delivery drivers 2 bucks + the change to round up to the next dollar. I don't know if that's dickish or not. I don't think delivery drivers really deserve a percentage tip unless it's an extraordinarily large order (Like requiring multiple trips. Then i'd tip a percentage). THey just drive the stuff to me. They're not taking my order, waiting my table, keeping my drink full, and being nice to me.  that said, I usually tip about 18% for a good waiter/ress, and by good, i mean was pleasant and didn't screw anything up because of what seemed like negligence. I like to tip them well because I feel they're under appreciated and I like to make them think they did an excellent job.

You must not have much actual experience with their customer service. I took my wife's 2007 black MacBook in with hard drive issues in 2010 and even though it was out of warranty, they backed up the drive, replaced it, upgraded my OS from 10.4 to 10.6, all for free. It's been running problem free and basically as new ever since, without running any anti-virus/firewall programs.

I'm glad you're slowly starting to feel better.   About a week after he left, we started to chat online and later that night I got a text from him talking about how he got hit on, and was going out the next day with her. That really hit the mark for me. All that sadness kind of turned into anger and (not proud of this at all) I lost my temper and lectured him about how this was not something I would have liked to hear (in some strong words). But then I took a week for myself (had to let those feelings loose) and I felt WAY better.  Set backs will happen even when you're doing the best you can. I think you're dealing very well. It seems that you know your shortcomings and I think that's AWESOME because if you want to fix things about yourself you know exactly what to focus on. Personal growth is always good, even if it's sometimes forced on you by life stuff.  And if you need to write 20 pages full of text about your thoughts and feelings it's totally okay. Especially online. No one knows you anyway.
There are tons of studies on this subject.  Even the self-reported Quality of Life index is lower amongst shorter males due to the systemic discrimination one faces in our society.  This is true even among happily married short guys. 
Just out of curiosity why don't you want Dota 2? I hated it too at first but the more you learn about it the better it gets IMHO. Just watch a lot of videos on [this channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/DotaCinema) to learn about the game. And yeah I agree having random games/applications on there is kind of annoying, they need to make a way to remove games you don't want.
Oh okay, so your opinion is actually completely different from the one you originally wrote. At any rate, I apologize for the snap judgement, I stand corrected.

I've considered it before, and might actually do it at some point. I already own both a Vox Tonelab and a POD HD400, and with some tweaking they are perfectly capable of outputting a quality sound.  But it's only a viable solution for me because I own a pair of powered PA speakers, and I could use one of those for monitoring. I wouldn't want to rely on the sound-guy for that.

When people refer to it like that, side chaining is when one signal triggers an affect. [Here's a picture](http://www.cakewalk.com/Support/kb/images_Tips/sidechain_1.gif).   It's most often used with a compressor, where one signal (like a kick drum) will cause another signal (like a lead or pad) to be compressed.   If you want to go more in depth, a "side chain" is the part of a device where a control signal is processed to cause something to happen. In a compressor, if nothing is plugged in to the "side chain" input, the side chain signal is the input signal to the compressor. 
Just turned my AC on the first time...why didnt I do this earlier in the week!
I didn't mention traits.  Edit: if that was too snippy and not clear, I apologize.  What I meant to say was that the selection-by-death process isn't actually selecting "for" or "against" anything.  It just kills a bunch of people.  The traits are another thing altogether from the stuff that applies pressure.  But starvation and natural disasters are good examples of environmental selection pressures.

I was on the programming team at my university shortly before dropping out (actually won one of the regional competitions), but we did a lot of those problems on UVA. It was actually pretty cool because our "coach" had a database with the problems with points assigned to them based on difficulty. Solving them in our free time got us points and bragging rights. It was really fun and I felt that it taught me a lot so I would definitely recommend the programming challenges book for a nice compilation of UVA problems, but I would also recommend looking for compilations based on skill level online like [this one](http://www.acmsolver.org/?p=1025). I do have a question for you. When you get stuck on a problem with UVA and I mean like really stuck, what methods do you feel work best for solving it. Often times a problem will require you to have a certain level of math knowledge, but you might not even know where to begin with those types of problems. When I hit those road blocks I would look at other solutions a lot of the time, but I felt conflicted by doing so as if I were not developing problem solving skills correctly by doing that.   What is your opinion on this?

You sound like an upset crossfitter or something.  It seemed well written enough to me, and not terribly "farfetched".  It assumes some knowledge of the training protocols in crossfit and bodybuilding, sure, but presumably the article/blog is geared towards knowledgeable weight training sorts, so that's not a huge issue.  I thought that it was a fairly well written article, written as an editorial experience from someone who has trained as a bodybuilder and as a crossfitter. *shrug*
Yet, every time I try to argue that, somehow *I'm* sexist. What?
this video is kind of hard to understand. and The pickup stuff is a kind of double-edged sword. In some ways it's really great because it gives people some rules to follow that helps them get outside their heads and just go up and talk to women. It also explains the dynamics and the ways that men and women flirt with each other, which a lot of people out there know nothing about. In many cases men (and women) are clueless and do things to turn off the opposite sex without even realizing they do it. The pickup stuff is good in that it explains a lot of these things.

Well that is not true. Jews began pushing for their own country way before any of the world wars. Christians and Jews were both migrating to Israel and encouraging a Jewish state around 1840. The issue of the Palestinians is a very complex one, however, it is not as though we simply kicked them off their land and now oppress them. There is a lot more to it then that and I don't think I could do it justice in a quickly typed out response. It is something I have studied extensively though. The UN's decision was not based off of sympathy for the Jewish people either, it was the Russians who were sympathetic to our cause early on. The British had made promises to both sides and it was because of their conflicting promises that the white paper was enacted. If we hadn't fought off the combined Arab forces, alone and without the help of our big brother America, then Israel would not exist. The whole notion that our country exists because the rest of the world felt bad for us is bullshit. Jews were dealing with antisemitism throughout Europe for centuries before the holocaust and the idea of claiming a homeland was not a new invention. Now, the holocaust may have helped push western sympathies our way, but it was not what caused Israel to form. 
The story: Dear Clients,  Two weeks ago we received an urgent call from one of the local no kill shelters.  25 (!!) cats and kittens were dropped off in the middle of the night in front of their thrift store.  They had no room and asked for our help.  How could we say no!  We couldn't so we have beautiful kittens that need homes.  Some of them were sickly and are being treated and will be ready soon.  As of now, we have 3 that are ready for a new home, 3 that will be weaned and ready in 2 weeks and 6 that will be weaned and ready in one month. Can you help?  Would you consider adopting one or two of these wonderful cats.  We have a client who comes in daily to work with socializing the litters and now they come to the front of their condo as soon as a human walks by and meow for attention. Please come by and visit them.  Thanks!   Teri Wiblin, D.V.M. Join Our Mailing List!  Visit our website at http://faustanimalhospital.com/

A few years ago my girlfriend, my dog, and I were smoking a bowl on the small patio area in front of our first floor apartment as we did most everyday. This patio looked out into the parking lot, where an unfamiliar, old white car pulled into a parking spot right in front of our place. The car was full, with two dudes sitting up front and another dude sitting in the back seat with a girl.   As the car parks, my girlfriend says that these people look sketchy and we should head into the apartment to finish up the bowl. I objected, insisting that we were safe on our patio. Just as I finish my sentence, a loud BANG goes off. I immediately recognized the bang as a gunshot and as I look up I see the white car empty and everybody inside bolts, except for the dude from the backseat, who stood propped up on the open car door.   I tell my girlfriend to go inside, and she does, grabbing the dog, running inside and locking me out of the apartment in complete fear. After she lets me into the apartment, I hide the bud and piece and proceed to call the police, fearing that this was a botched robbery attempt. As the phone is ringing though, I see the guy from the back seat motioning at me through the peep hole, for me to come to him. High as fuck, I walk outside and ask the guy, "do you need me to call the cops?!?!" He responds, "I don't want you to call anyone, I want you to ..." ...and he passed out, nailing his head on the frame of the open car door, spilling even more of his blood in the parking lot, at which point I realize this dude has shot himself in the leg right in the thigh and is bleeding the fuck out. Again, I am pretty blazed at this point, so I run inside to call the cops, whom I had forgotten that I needed to call.   I went back inside, with the emergency dispatcher on the phone, staring through the peep hole, attempting to describe the man who had shot himself in the leg and the car he had arrived in. As I am describing, my girlfriend is basically telling me I am wrong in everything I am saying; the color of the guy's shirt, the color of his hair, his race...etc. At this point, I just hand the phone to my girlfriend so she can talk to the dispatcher and she stands, looking out the window and describes everything perfectly, in a way I was too high to accomplish. Finally, the cops show up and take the guy into custody, along with his friends whom they found scattered about the neighborhood. The cops never knocked on my door and there was no follow up with us from LE regarding the incident. After they took the crime scene tape down and the cops left, we went back outside and blazed again. 
Take a few bowls while drinking some beers. You'll know when you get there because you won't wanna smoke anymore. 
It's possible you were using too much.  You barely need any for tattoos, I think  with too much, you end up pulling the color. Like use the amount you would for your lips. 
I guess I don't really know my husband then.  In fairness, we have two bathrooms, so this may be a big part of why the shower/shit combo has never occurred.

I like Wilco, but i think it is a challinging listening often. Good songs. They make songs, songs, and the instrumentalisation is often over the top - totally genius. Still, Wilco ain't always the easiest listen. Not english so sorry for bad english and awkvard ways of saying things. And lack of time to put the effort into saying what i wish to say. Therefore i can easily imagine your choice of band. Never seen them, but i know they would've be impressing as hell.

I knoooow, MAC lipsticks at pretty damn affordable so it's hard to say no. My no buy is over next week and I'm going to a MAC counter so I'll have to try it on!
That price boost came along with a significant increase in the allowed size of XBLA games. That meant better graphics, more content, etc. and paved the way for more recent Arcade releases that are much closer to disc-based games that would cost $60, so $15-$20 is not a bad price. Simpler games still cost less.
I think another aspect is the time to actually produce the beer. When you are at capacity with excess demand you will probably be better off producing a beer that takes half the time to make. I'm pretty sure this is what brought us Sucks from Lagunitas a year ago.

No, just no.   I know hipsters drink PBR but a lot of other people have been drinking PBR for much longer than hipsters have because it's good cheap beer.   I hate that when I drink PBR I'm called a hipster. I'm just a broke dude who wants to drink his sorrows away.  I'm just trying to do my part to stop this stereotype about PBR. Take care.

Hey OP, I'm making a complete overhaul on TF2, and part of it is HD backgrounds. If you could add about 200-500 pixels of relatively unimportant background stuff, I could include this wallpaper.

I find this very interesting and would like to preface my argument that it is of course fine to be attracted to amputees. However I do feel that it is justifiable to compare it to the like of Necrophilia simply because of the scale along which the two are based. For my view on Necrophilia here is a frankly eye opening video form [David Mitchell.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B_Yw-JAnuw) My basic opinion is that as long as the two partners are willing (or have at least given consent) and have a full understanding of what they are agreeing to any sexual fetish is just grand. However both of these fetishes play on one partner being placed into a position they would rather not be in i.e. dead or missing one or multiple limbs. These states are also not the "ideal" states for humans to be in and, as Mitchell points out, the most difficult for people who don't share the fetish to comprehend as attractive. It is because of these two factors that a certain amount of disgust is justified as, though to almost polar extents, it is taking pleasure in other people's misfortune.
Camera pans back and it's Tarkus playing.  He *is* real you guys.

I think I saw that date on the wiki
What's his name? 
This left me speechless, I have tingles all over my body.
I'll be pulling the trigger on some Honey Peary as soon as I figure out which PG/VG blend I prefer.

I've met Velvet twice, and she was super nice and friendly. The first time was at a TNA house show, and I had a Victory Road 09 cover that I was bound and determined to get signed, and Velvet was doing the for-pay autograph line where you were only supposed to get one item signed - and it was supposed to be the official program. She not only signed the dvd cover, and took it backstage and got Angelina and Madison to sign it. The second time, at another house show, we talked in the autograph line for a moment before the show, she signed my Beautiful People shirt and said she couldn't get Angelina to sign that quite as easy as the DVD (she was out of the company by then). During her entrance, she switched sides to do her entrance in front of my section, much to the chagrin of the other side (she entered left, instead as right as usual on tv).
Entering, thanks!
We're talking about TYPE of shot. A soft wedge isn't a full wedge. That's why the last 2 aren't consistent
I just got really high and floated up to space while listening to a certain Bob Marley album.  Can anyone guess which album?
I actually like RC cola... 
Fair enough. Personally I'm not a fan of Toriyama, however each to their own. :-)
I think all supporters groups are equally great and equally annoying. Except for the ones who only sing for the camera, or get too drunk pregaming to sing for the 90 (I'm looking at you, American Outlaws).  Worldwide, I'm wildly impressed with Japan's fans. And Korea's fans are like Japan's fans who've been injected with "inferiority complex" DNA, which makes them even more insane.
Pics from the side profile would make this much easier (sorry, I know it has been said)  In the meanwhile, compare measurements to the official pdga specs :  http://www.pdga.com/files/documents/PDGA_approved_discs_053013.pdf
I hate that commercial.  But it's not nearly as bad as [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mr31JemdOs).
Then fell down to get the charge.  (I like Battier)
Fucker got what he deserved. There's a special place in hell for ticks and mosquitoes.
They're the reason I try everything before I buy. Hated the sound enough to immediately send them back for a refund (minus a restock fee). Ended up going back to an all A Series setup... minus an 18" Oriental China Trash. 
On a long trip away from a real kitchen, I got by using the deli section of a big chain grocery, the sort where they have entrees and side dishes.  I bought stuff on sale and doled it out into servings.  You could get pasta salads and such that taste good cold, and something more filling for evening or breakfast.  That's a really tight budget though, and without knowing where you are I have no idea how far it will stretch.
UHC 11 - probably already recorded or they're doing it as we speak (read)
I think they meant self defense *isn't* hitting, ie. you shouldn't *hit* anyone for any reason but to defend yourself.
"Learn to obey orders before you give them."  I'm usually the General type, but if someone else suggests tactics, I listen to them and work with them to strategise. Teamwork ftw
I'm part of the problem with officiating? Man, I had no idea I had so much influence over the refs. The finals will be an easy call this year then. &lt;/s&gt;  Seriously, I'm just saying it's a sport where retaliation isn't a rarity, and he's a player who exemplifies that.  And for the final fucking time, I DON'T AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT HE GOT A TECH. I've said that multiple times. You're putting words in my mouth when you say I'm part of the problem with the calls, since I have already said that he shouldn't have gotten one. You're just twisting stuff at this point.
What a bloody moron.
Teenagers love Fight Club because they're still children, and fight club is more or less about becoming a man. Once you're a man it sort of loses its appeal. 
Don't worry you are doing the right thing.  I adopted a cat with asthma that someone else couldn't afford to take care of. He has been a joy to love, even though he hates the inhaler.  It sucks not being able to afford the meds. Sorry about that. I'm sure you struggled with the decision, I hope you are ok. 
So, again you demonstrate my point.  Argument from ignorance.  Come back after you get an education.
 My neighbor is Catholic and smokes cigars,  therefore all Catholics smoke cigars.
personally i would price it on the quality of life of said person who's life we where putting a price on 
My Wii was stolen in high school and I contacted Nintedo about it. They had me send a copy if the police report and they sent me a brand new Wii and let me redownload all my Virtual Console games for free too.
You're flying a salvage ship?
Baldur's Gate, worth it.
he actually already used a strategy of opening the gates to let in cao pi's troops and destroyed them. so it was very likely this could be a trap too.
It could show the range of the ward too, like a circle around the center of the ping or something.
I know a gay guy who came out to his wife after 2 kids. Very religious family, and they both trying to convert him to straight :O they're still together for some years now.
Well because there's no shipping

To my knowledge I don't have a chronic fissure but have tried anal things in the past that definitely resulted in a fissure (pain and bleeding) so yes anal is likely to cause problems with your fissure.
Tell that to Miami.
When?
This is also what causes the horrible cramping some people get when they travel. It's extremely painful, but there are medications you can take to avoid it.
I just want to thank you all for being in and doing this bundle both for charity and exposing me to these awesome games.
&gt;Amazing book  The crew members bear more than a passing resemblance to the crew of another small freighter who are still free so long as you don't take the sky from them.
[All books](#b "White Walkers and the Wights? the visions offered by Shade of the Evening or Weirwood Paste? Warging/Greenseeing unless you count the hereditary bit as being "blood" related, I suppose? ")
Oh that would make sense. I'm on win 8- 64 bit 
When I first read that book, I was constantly awestruck by how the text could simultaneously be among the most beautiful and the most appalling things I'd ever read. I don't know of anyone who produces that effect like McCarthy does.
great job op

"Necessary" is the worst.
8.1 it is then. 
Do anything hundreds of times and it'll be that easy.  Do it once and get frustrated that you didn't do it as well as Mr. Seed and you'll never get good.
They almost Astroed.
I like having a clean mouth, but less than the pain of how much i'd assume anal is. Fuck me (literally), i'm going to sit on the cake. edit: ass (wtf?) to cake
Perfection Is what you have there.
true. I guess that is why i thought I was alone, I'm on the internet a lot. You're smart.
I used to work for Palm back when they had some Kiosks in the malls around here.  One night I'm doing my normal thing (watching videos cause no one was coming to the store) when this dude walks up to me and starts asking about his daughter's Zire72.  I tried my best to get the thing working for him, but there was nothing I could really do.  Tried to talk him into buying a new unit, but he wasn't interested.  I worked on it for another 5 minutes until I just gave up not being able to fix his issue.  Later on, after he left, one of the people from the stores comes over and asks if I knew who that was.  I didn't know; she told me it was  [Delroy Lindo](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005148/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).  TL;DR: Delroy Lindo asked me to fix his Palm Pilot, didn't know it was him until after he left.

YES WE DID!
How did it start?
Here's an alternate version: http://i.imgur.com/EOmjnUa.gif  Also, the original: http://imgur.com/QhjXF52  Last one I had in the wish folder. Yay! Next I want to work on the 'what's yours is mine' folder.
he's ironic, genius. 
YEAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
TIL the USA and my penis have this in common.
Is gut komic. Many joke.
Dogs bite is extremely anti-pit bull and has a tendency to spread myths as facts. Better to use a good source as opposed to one in favour of taking a dog from a family and euthanizing it when it has shown no history of aggression. 
I would have told the guy he's an asshole.  I can't imagine he would call my boss and even if he did, I can't imagine my boss wouldn't agree that he was an asshole.
FUCK YEAH ADAM!!!
For a reaction of course!

you said "honor"
Hahaha, well done! Thank you very much!
It's really hard to get back to being friends after you lied to me about your affair. I know it's not fair to you but I loved you and it hurt that you not only cheated on your husband but didn't want me. I'll always love you as a friend but it will take years to get over. I'm sorry and I miss you so much. I hope you are happy because that's the most important thing in the end. 
I have gone on waaay more dates with less effort finding people than any other place I've lived (and I have lived in 15 different states all across the US). But so far nothing has really come of any of them, so it has been a lot longer moving into a more serious relationship than other places. So it has its pros and cons I guess.
I fucking wish.  Every day for the past 3 years I've attempted to teach people how to play rush on BFBC2.  3 years later, people still can't follow simple instructions on good attack routes, choke points to avoid getting caught up in, using smoke as cover, and pushing forwards as a group.  9 games out of 10 I'm solo carrying a team to victory, or we're getting shut down completely because I'm the only person doing a goddamn thing and the other team isn't 100% retarded.  I quickly transition from the General to the Messenger or [The Get-On-My-Level Übernerd](http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2011/10/01/the-9-most-annoying-types-of-online-gamers/) in most games that are going south.
"Seriously, dude. It's time to get a job. I know you're supposed to be a 'house husband', but that implies some level of effort at keeping up the house and shit.  Playing video games all day and making up stupid projects that you never complete anyway does not count."
i dunno, it's just something about her smile, when i saw her i immediately thought of amy schumer.  She kind of has this ditzy innocent look.
Riot does record those stats - you can see them on http://quickfind.kassad.in after the game is over.  It's likely they will start putting it in the game client pretty soon.
Aw, this is sad. 
For me it's the beauty, creativity, and acting.  It has a quality to it that makes me do a double take on whether or not it airs on NBC or HBO.  But I understand your point about the fandom, and how people are reacting to the show.  Their enthusiasm benefits me though so let them do whatever they do. 
link doesn't work, can you reup to imgur?
