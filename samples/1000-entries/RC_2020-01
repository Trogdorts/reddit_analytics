On the advice of the good people of reddit, I got myself an iPad and started using procreate. I find it isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúgood‚Äù as sketchbook on my pc, in I feel it doesn‚Äôt have as many options, but I have greatly enjoyed the portability of the iPad. I‚Äôve been wanting to try my hand at fantasy landscapes for awhile, and I get frustrated that I can‚Äôt make them look like the ones I find on Pinterest. Any constructive criticism would be very welcome indeed.

My grandfather had Alzheimer‚Äôs and that movie hit me so hard when it first came out.. instant tears when Miguel was singing it to Coco. Hit me even harder once I watched it after he passed away last year. We played Remember Me during his service and it was such a hard, but beautiful moment listening, the song perfectly captured how we were feeling.

Have 1 called something like "Trust Fund Tracker". Was a nice annointed I used for a bit.  The description where it says "enemies will drop some cash when hit".  This 1 says "enemies will drop a buttload of cash when hit."  3 bonuses are the cash.
Totally agree!   I'm a girl and  I loved watching boy shows as a kid. Especially superhero shows like Teen Titans, X -Men, Max Steel, etc and other shows like Beyblade and Transformers.  I just liked watching shows that had action. Since all of the girls shows at the time we're often boring and promoted "friendship" and "girl power" *YAY!* Like, I didn't really care about that. Just give me a show with amazing characters and some action. Hell! I played with cars and trucks as a kid, I played with Legos (I even played with the "girl" branded Legos. That sucked in my opinion). I also played with LPS (Littlest Pet Shops), barbie dolls and baby dolls, and other "girly" toys.   Just because you like something that targets the opposite sex. It doesn't automatically make you "this" or "that." It just means you like that thing, there's nothing else to it.

You really honestly believe that every person having problems is entirely due to "they just don't know what they're doing"? That's pretty elitist to think that. I guarantee you that the kind of people who are so dumb that they put thermal paste in the socket are far less than 1% of all those having issues, and acting like that's what comprises the "so called driver issues" is just....I don't know. It's a dick thing to think.

Ur lucky at least u get to play i was outside with my mom doing nothing, it was cringe
That's my experience.  Once in a rare while I get a really good placement.  I had one a week or so ago on Hawkins.  It was in a corner behind some obstructions.  Usually there's a generator in that corner and my general luck is the totem would be there right next to the generator.  Since there was no generator there this time, it seems the players just never went to that corner to look for the totem.  Lasted 90% of the match and actually affected play.  My other experience with Ruin is if it doesn't pop immediately, I get teams that are proficient enough with skill checks that gens aren't exploding as a minimum and just as often, they're seemingly hitting all of their great skill checks or just not getting very many skill checks.  Anyone else feel that when they're under some negative skill check effect, skill check frequency increases quite noticeably?

I would try white nail polish for an improvement from your current 1/4-ass situation to a 1/2-ass or possibly 5/8-ass solution. But before you try to gild this turd make sure that the current repair job is reasonably able to last a few more years.  From the photo it really looks like several areas have little or no glue(?).

NOOOOOOO :(
Criterion's great but I say if you find a movie you like, watch other films by that same director. You're more likely to find stuff you like that way. Let's say you loved 12 Angry Men - well it was an early film by the great Sidney Lumet and he's got a ton of classic movies to check out that aren't all on Criterion - Network, Dog Day Afternoon, The Verdict, Serpico, The Hill, Fail-Safe, Prince of the City - all movies that even a Terminator/Aliens/Star Wars fan might like. You're more likely to see Criterion fans following directors than anything else.
Ah rip
Ah, yes. Ye olde try it till they die. Then cut it back a bit for the therapuetic level!
It looks very realistic, except on the face. If you can't match the same level of realism on the face as the rest of the body then perhaps you should should stylise the rest of the portrait more so it doesn't look out of place.

If your team is already running a breach denial op (Kaid or Bandit) you can use mute as a soft roamer. Not sure if that‚Äôs the correct term for it but I‚Äôll explain.  I like to use him as an anchor for a room adjacent to site that is essential for enemy attacks. Like I said if the team already has a Kaid or Bandit then you can save your jammers for yourself. Place them around the room you choose to defend to prevent drone access to you as well as be able to maneuver through Lion‚Äôs drone as well as be immune or quickly nullify Dokkebi calls. Setting up your jammers this way can help you remain undetected, or force the enemy to use utility in an attempt to make you rotate to site.   When defending outside of site make sure you don‚Äôt overly expose yourself, or peek long angles against a team full of ACOG users. If you‚Äôre using Shotty then hold close tight angles. It‚Äôs also helpful to have teammates give you a shield for cover. (If they‚Äôre agreeing to help you out. Easiest in a 5 stack)  Lastly, having free jammers makes mute a menace on staircases. No drones can get up the staircases and the attackers will always be disadvantaged when trying to push up your stairs. All you need a Jager or Wamai to get rid of a nade or 2, then use shotty to contest the stairs on enemies.   The breach denial capabilities are great, but the information denial to the offensive team can shut a push down or slow it to a point where too much time burns off the clock. The drone denial makes him great for holding chokepoints, stairs, or rooms near to or above the objective.

Well both trilogies were made by different people with different storytelling, art style and photography, so it makes sense that one trilogy compared to the other was more flashy, because storytelling seems to take a higher priority in the prequels, whether it‚Äôs bad or not, it does make room for scenes that involve no action, thus no flashy scenes.

LOL I did understand what did you write - but I do believe that Turkey is very aware of this possibility, thus they are supporting the al-Sadr in his effort to gain power, and as matter of fact - any politician in Iraq, which want to keep Iraq intact.   That is why they are "close" with Iran - they both (Turkey and Iran) have potentially same problem with the Kurdish minority.   That said, the Turkey, or better to say Erdoƒüan and AKP, have developed alliance with some conservative Kurdish Sunni politician and tribes against leftist and PKK, but if the KRG (lead by Barzani) achieve true independence - that may rise the same expectations and amongst their domestic +20 million Kurds... So, I have no doubt that they are aware of this.   But, there is another issue: They (Turkey aka AKP aka Erdoƒüan) will also like to restore some Ottoman Empire's lost territories, which are today part of the Iraq and KRG.   If they can not "snap" any territories from KRG or Iraq, then it is better to have Iraq as it is, without independent KRG. But, if the Iraq become true "failed state" and become divided and in territorial meaning, then (under excuse to protect local Turkmens population) they may invade and Iraq.   And, as I see the Erdoƒüan as megalomaniac, I will not be surprised if his ultimate goal in Iraq is no less than taking Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk region. So, they are ambivalent for now, but and waiting for the glimpse of chance LOL

The YB batteries seem to last about a year, maybe year and a half, so a lot of IGG backers are needing replacements now, but everywhere i check too is out of stock.   My battery bloated 364 days after my win2 was delivered, like it literally lasted me a year. I managed to get a YB replacement while gpdgaming still had some.   If you can't get the exact batteries with the proprietary connector, can you source similar batteries and then include some adapters that'll let us use other similar Li-HV batteries in the win2?   Or link us to the Ganfeng lithium battery cells themselves without the connectors? I still have my old battery, and i could possibly move the connector over since i have a soldering station.

Other than the demand, it sort of is. Just need to fit what the Manager there deems appropriate. A big factor for sure is if you'd fit the team there. Our store runs really well, but there are for sure some personalities that just wouldn't fit.

Keep in mind that Australia being on fire at this time of year is nothing new. Of course, this season has been worse than most, but it happens to some extent every year. Now, people with a certain agenda are using it as an opportunity to shout "Climate Change!"   Now, has any of this been geoengineered? I have no idea. I'm not very knowledgeable about such things. But when discussing this, just try to keep in mind that bushfires are a regular occurrence in this country.
The first serious relationship I had was with an abuser. She would always be super chill with everyone we hung out with, and then behind closed doors, she was a literal sociopath.   * She lied to her only parent and would steal money from them. She lied to me about it, even when confronted, it was used for drugs and alcohol.  * We used to play wrestle until she started exclusively going for my groin. Punching, slapping, squeezing, it didn't matter what it was, if she could cause me pain, she would. This resulted in me being extremely anxious when any future women have been in their vicinity. I was tormented for months by her in this way. I stopped the play wrestling because I just couldn't handle 30 minutes of her trying to cause me ridiculous amounts of pain.  * She constantly started fights for no reason. To the point where she could call someone hot in a movie and if I said someone was hot, it was a fight. I didn't love her, or didn't care about her because I said that. This didn't end until I apologized and said I didn't care about that person.   * She accused me of cheating frequently because in fact, she was actually cheating. No proof or anything, just would start telling me I was cheating on her.   * She once got mad at me over nothing while driving, and started doing 180KPH while yelling at me and not looking at the road. She'd also do the same while I was driving, trying to distract me.  The final straw was when she admitted she cheated on me 2 weeks into our 1.5 year relationship, and more than a dozen times during. The last of which, involved fucking her own cousin.  I realized that I should never be treated like shit again. I cut all contact. She still tries to ask my friends and family she sees around about me. My friends thankfully had my back.  Turns out after we broke up, everyone came to me about how she either came on to them, or told them about our sex life, which based on whether we were in a fight or not, was great or awful.  She is a truly awful human being who fucked her way through at least 3 friend groups after I dumped her and ruined countless people's lives with her shitty being.

The puppets/CGI animated to look like puppets in the new Star wars material look fine enough but they are only accepted because of nostalgia. If you created a brand new IP and all the critters in it looked like puppets rather than high quality CGI I think people would shit on it.

So i don't think you know what the skills you wanted to use actually does so i'll make it clear:   Gag order and Terrifying cruelty requires you to use a dagger, which is a physical weapon. They do primarily physical damage and scales with Finesse, which is completely useless for the magic schools. The secondary effects are useless unless you've already removed all armor.   Since you said that you want to use these abilities in spite of them being physical attacks i suggested options for something that would work better with other INT based schools of magic.   I'll make it simple for you though: If you don't want physical damage don't play a rogue and if you don't even understand the basics of the ability trees don't play tactician.

There was a huge drama on there about a month ago where they banned prominent Trans users that complained about the moderation team being transphobic. It was a huge issue where they held a big Q&amp;A with the trans users on there, nothing has changed though, people are still banned if they call the mods out on their transphobia, they do have a trans mod who they push out there whenever there is an issue, she basically acts as their "token" trans woman, she puts the mods before the community every time. Lots of complaints but nothing has changed.
But best for this

This is probably not your game man. Feel free to give it a go but the game is old and top heavy. Things have came and gone several times. Guides are out dated and soloing and boxing is probably like nothing you have ever experienced. All that being said a lot of us still love it and Norrath is home. Good luck finding a place to scratch your itche.
The Reylo thing never felt right.  It was obvious in TFA that Finn and Rey had an attraction.  But no, she likes the psychopathic torturer responsible for the deaths of millions across the galaxy.  Another issue was Poe's sexuality, it was pretty ambiguous through the first two movies.  Then, in the last movie, they added an unnecessary plot point, and a 5 second "you wanna hook up" glance, for the sole purpose of clarifying he is straight.  Then they add a same-sex kissing scene between two characters who are little more than extras (one of them was just an extra)...then they remove that scene in some overseas markets.  Simply leaving Poe's sexuality as ambiguous would have been much better than all of this pandering.
Those are some pretty lofty features for a guy I‚Äôm just hearing about. May be worth checking out

OP's math is pretty straightforward though: AAPL is valued $1.3 trillion today - and Tesla has a good shot at dominating markets 20x the size of Apple's markets combined.  If Tesla can achieve an Apple-alike market position (which is a **BIG** if), then a 1.3x20 = 26 trillion dollars valuation is pretty much the probable outcome - dominant companies make a lot of money and are valuable.  One TSLA share worth 6 figures is within the spectrum of possibilities.  (Personally I'd be fine with a 5 digit valuation too, $69,420 FTW.)

I won the game that this happened in!
Can I ask how they responded to the hate? I didn't know the game yet when all that content came out. I'm living in the aftermath x')
I have a size 6 womans shoe in Heelys of course that I can't wear I just needed the wheels but that's actually a size 5 in men's. According to Skates.com and Heelys.com the Heelys size chart shows that whatever the women's US size number is its actually one humber smaller men's US. Heelys.com only shows to men's size 9 but if you look and compare the woman's size to the men's ones in the same column it shows a woman's a number 10 for the men's number 9 So I'm not sure where you got that info.   Not mad or anything I'm just curious as to where that info came from or are you meaning that even though a size 8 in women's would be the number 7 in men's but the true size measurement in women's 8 is really a 6 and a half?  Skate.com has a better Heelys size chart here.  https://www.skates.com/Heelys-Shoe-Sizing-s/226275.htm
Honestly, this could‚Äôve been set up or the girlfriend is just joking around.   But if she‚Äôs not joking around, then what the fuck
I'm wondering now if I mounted mine wrong and that's why my left stabs are sticking (the stab bar seems to be hitting the plate). Do you have any pictures to explain how the screws mount? It came with small and large screws but I only used the small ones.

Yeah okay how many wives and wedlock children, at age 21? Lmfao. Is it the person they are interested in or is it the superficial? Just because you don't get instant access to someone's life, friends, status, money et cetera doesn't mean they're hiding anything, that's just paranoia.   On the contrary what's not good for OP is the type of paranoid woman that accuses such bullshit like cheating for absolutely no good reason.

I was living in San Francisco when both the Tubbs fire and the Camp fire happened. It wasn't red like OP's photo, but it was very orange, and the smoke basically blocked out the sun completely
Haven't watched it myself, but that seems to be the consensus of my friends.
&gt;And I still think Noah Feldman is correct.  Except Turly showed he isn't. There is nothing in the constitution requiring the articles to be sent to the Senate in order for the president to be impeached. Neither you nor Feldman have made that case.  &gt; The Dems would have been better served to have tried to do that **after** they followed the process.   They did follow the process.  &gt; but when the **Dems** are the roadblock   It's not a roadblock, just politics. This is a political process, after all. McConnell showed he would not respect the oath he took.  Meanwhile new inforamation has come out pretty much confirming the quid pro quo (again), and Bolton no longer has an excuse not to testify.  Sorry, but your irrelevant argument has become even flimsier.  Since you are once again refusing to acknowledge counter-arguments, I guess I'll just end this here.
Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I thought this was America  You‚Äôre rocking the look dude :)

The sad part is that most people at Google have known all along that alienating users is an absolutely terrible long-term strategy, but people in leadership positions are always thinking they're the exception. Or maybe they're so full of themselves they think that users will actually *appreciate* things like Android notifications that are basically ads. Part of it might be due to bringing in executives from outside (e.g. Vic Gundotra, the former MS exec who was in charge of Google+ and seemingly did everything he could to sabotage it), but I think it's mostly the prisoner's dilemma in action. The senior leadership could have stopped a lot of that stuff, but lately they seem to be escalating to burning employees' trust as well as users', so instead of turning Google into another Microsoft, they're turning into another Oracle or IBM. I can't fathom why anyone would want to do that, but here we are.

Known issue in 1903. Here is some [fun reading](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/texthighlight-menu-colour/5865c7d4-49a2-4deb-bdfd-a957903df192). (Infuriating but also not surprising would probably be a better description...) Basically, at least as far as I've been able to determine, The Windows Shell overrides the default menu drawing behaviour and uses white for the selection background. (System default is a blue colour- the one you see in task manager). If I had to guess, I'd say the change was made for dark mode, but it was not made conditionally, so when not in dark mode, it still uses a light colour. The result is that Windows Explorer as well as Open/Save dialogs appear with a white highlight colour. It looks like this is hard-coded.

Uhhhh I mean I was with you and agreeing with the majority of this until the end, holy shit dude.  You made some good points but if you think it's okay to freak out and go "FUCK YOU CUNTS DIE DIE" just because you're frustrated with people maybe that has something to do with your lack of friends.  Not cool at all and completely undermines any good points you may have made.
Tell your husband according to credible research, genes do play a part in homosexuality, how much we dont know but its there and came from both parents.

Shhhhh none of them are old enough to remember.
I‚Äôm not sure anyone, logically at least, is saying it will stop all criminals or all killings by guns. So let‚Äôs just throw that defense out.   Similar to pro life/choice both sides argue extremes. Liberals want abortions at 8 months....   I digress, the argument is more of common sense gun laws. Universal registry, stricter background checks. And you keep your 2nd amendment. So if you collect guns, hunt, and can pass improved common sense laws and stricter background checks I‚Äôm all for you having a battle/assault rifle (I guess, if you need to have one... or an arsenal like my Texas buddies claim to have).   Again this wouldn‚Äôt stop all criminals or all mass shootings but to deny common sense gun laws is a no brainer to me. I mean we just passed a federal law to raise the age to buy cigarettes and they‚Äôre trying to change regs and laws on vapes or whatever they‚Äôre called.

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm worried about her, it all comes up when I‚Äôm thinking about my baby and how I want to be better for him and how I hope to god I‚Äôm nothing like her.

I don‚Äôt want to focus on her, but her shitty parenting comes to mind when I think about what kind of mom I‚Äôm going to be. But you‚Äôre right about everything. I need to focus on me and mine and let her be miserable on her own. Thank you.

there's a lot of debate about whether it's true or not but there are so many people that say their MPG improves (in any car, not just subaru) after 5 to 10,000 miles  lots of people at the same time say it's "broken in" after just 20 miles and will never get better, and it's just salesman tactic to tell you not to worry or another 5,000 miles  it's just that so many people say it's true that it's kinda hard to tell  regardless tho, 18mpg sucks.  i'm in a 19 3.6r and i'm at 5 or 6k miles and my lifetime average for the vehicle is 20.7 mpg

UCF isn't a social school. Its a great CS school, but tbh the program isnt worth the drawbacks. No employer cares where you went to school so long as its credible.   UCF has hoards of commuter students who dont live on campus, people don't have incentive to meet other people, and the subreddit is half depression posts and people trying to make friends due to the inability to do so otherwise.
You‚Äôre ‚Äúevidence‚Äù is slapping the Rockstar logo on a white background with a line of text underneath? Good job bro, it‚Äôs not like you could have made that in 2 minutes on Photoshop, or even MS paint.

Well it depends on if you‚Äôre in the ranked queue or ‚Äúplay‚Äù. In play there‚Äôs some fudging with the matchmaking so you‚Äôre on a more level playing field but in ranked you‚Äôre against *anyone*. A lot of people get into Arena because they liked Hearthstone or because they watch people play on Twitch and YouTube. All of those people are going to be likely to copy deck lists and search ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù to MIB-max their wildcards.
Kinda both though, really.

Speed Racer, like the chief complaint formthis mocie was how campy it was and how much they hated all the bright colors. God it‚Äôs like they hated the fact that this movie was from a Saturday morning anime and they acknowledged that fact. This was a time when adapted properties had to be dower super serious affairs that were mocking the source material.   Speed Racers message is also super good. It‚Äôs about little creative people that are just completely swallowed up by big corporations. This is a situation that reflects heavily into today with the Disney monopoly on most properties

Why do you think the US is losing the trade war?   If you just mean both sides losing, I mostly agree.

Dude's got a Sam-still singing...
Where's your motivation?
The reason that the UK and the US entered so late is because they wanted the USSR to be destroyed by Germany as much as possible. They had long seen the USSR as an enemy, too. If both of your enemies are fighting, why not just let them go at it?  Basically, the longer they waited to enter the war, the more losses the USSR would suffer, which would leave the US and the UK in a better relative position later. They wanted to make sure that after the war ended the USSR would be too damaged to seriously challenge global US and UK power.

The About section of the Golden Flower channel has been updated. It says: " I love the D46?E of flowers. Your beautiful number isn't a code in it of itself. It is a key for something else, whether that means salt or not." That second sentence is new. Could it refer to 594?

the prestige. it isn't just about 2 magicians who constantly try to get back at each other. it's about blind obsession as well. in the case of angier he was blind both with rage and jealousy. first he was obsessed with getting revenge and to getting borden to admit what he did wrong. later in the movie he's blinded and obsessed over borden's incredible trick, so much so that he completely misses the opportunity tesla's machine gave him. angier only needed to use his machine once. once he had a perfect clone of himself he could recreate borden's trick. but he was obsessed with the trick he thought it was in his mind that the option completely escapes him and he resorts to murder, mass murders in fact. his obsession is so potent he walks into that machine every night afraid that he'll be committing suicide each time, but either way being a murderer every time.  borden's own obsession with his trick lead to the downfall of his marriage and his wife's suicide, his brothers girlfriend, and later on his brother himself.  i just love that movie, it plays a trick on the audience in so many ways. everytime i rewatch it i notice something different. it took many viewings to realize the underlying theme of the movie is obsession, not just the endless cycle of revenge. different kinds of obsessions caused all kinds of grief. it's not even like the movie hid that theme much since tesla says it outright basically. but the movie has so much else going on you kind of don't think about it.

Even though their sound is quite different from Timber Timbre, I've always really liked their jazzy/soul sound ever since I found them through their album with all their covers (I think it was "BBNGLIVE 1")  and became a fan.  They do have a similar vibe sometimes, depending on the album/song.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Yes, they are. My mom has not heard back from Robbie's parents. When she did hear from them, they were not attending. She feels that they are on their way out of the church, so there's that.

What's with the never heal meta? I was trying out the auto dict dict last night, and had back to back games where all four survivors getting out was in play, was next to an injured survivor that just wanted to do the last gen, that survivor ended up dying right next to the gen, and didn't even have adrenaline.   I get that there are definitely scenarios where you don't heal here. Both times I assumed they had adrenaline, because that's the most obvious, but I also understand if the game is turning into a nail biter and doing the gen is the only way you're even going to get one person out. There's also the scenario that you're in a swf and you know someone else is getting chased so you have time, but that definitely wasn't the case with these two, and something I've seen in general. Is there something I'm missing with people who want to skip healing to do the last gen in these cases?
They are still in duty, right ? I knew that before the pope had an army

Invest heavy in Igni, nearly everything burns. Oils and certain positions like Thunderbolt and Petri Philter are uber important. Honestly just hone the skills you never thought were useful before. I've found the second level of Quen with the visible force field can be very helpful with how it restores vitality with each enemy blow, just be careful not to overuse it and let it drain your stamina. I can't stress this enough, learn enemy weaknesses such as Foglets being vulnerable to Aard and Wraiths to Yrden. Combat is an art to a witcher and you just need to learn how to hold the brush.
Thanks !
True, and it's nice to know that when you decide on a show/movie on Prime, it'll play with no issues.   Did you know you don't necessarily have to download media on the majority of pirating apps/apks? Unless you want a copy of it on your phone/computer, which is usually how people get in trouble with their ISP when pirating, streaming media is easier and takes up no space on your device!

CAN bus data showing a Nominal full pack capacity of 75.95 kWh (310 mi * 245 Wh/mi) and 4.5% (nominally 3.4 kWh) buffer.  The 245 Wh/mi rating is hard-coded based on EPA tests.  SoC reaches 0% when you're down to just the buffer left, but you would actually have to go below 0% and burn through the buffer to achieve 310 miles at the rated 245 Wh/mi, which means Tesla is choosing to misrepresent the usable range of their pack by the same 4.5%.  There's many sources for capacity on the LR pack.  The Wikipedia article references a [comment](https://electrek.co/2017/08/08/tesla-model-3-battery-packs-50-kwh-75-kwh-elon-musk/) by Elon of "~75" during a conference call, while the [EPA certification](https://electrek.co/2017/08/07/tesla-model-3-new-details-revealed/) lists either 78 or 80.5 kWh, and leaked Tesla service manuals refer to it as 74 kWh.  I'm going off of what my own car's CAN data shows me.

Matthew Hurt is the key to Duke going deep in March. BC's entire defensive strategy for this game is to double and deny Vernon Carey, Jr. And so Hurt is getting wide open looks and nailing them.

Hey. How are things? Not so good huh? I know, its tough. I'd be lying if I say i know you how you feel, so I'm just settling for I know, it's tough. What I do know is first things first, this wasn't your fault. Don't think it is. Once again, something tough to handle. But you can handle it.   This experience is now a part of who you are, and the culmination of all your experiences, good AND bad is what makes us. This chapter of you may be the most defining moment of you being you. It won't kill you. It can't harm you anymore than it already seems to have. It is just going to define who you are tomorrow, and the day after.

Hey everyone, I found this watch at an auction and i was wondering if anyone could tell me a little more about it. Thanks!
You‚Äôve likely already considered this, if it‚Äôs an option at all, but if you‚Äôre interested is there some way to teach in your field?
Man unless you‚Äôre gonna live in an actual box that‚Äôs just not feasible for most people. Especially if they‚Äôre single.   I think if you can come up with a reasonable budget where you‚Äôre saving for retirement and maintaining an emergency fund you‚Äôll be fine. Also you might want to consider renting a room to a friend to pay it off faster
I‚Äôm upvoting this out of principle because it is a picture of retro gaming gear that doesn‚Äôt include some shitty made up story.
hey alright

Not seeing him as human? What about seeing the low libido partner as a human? Not wanting to have sex is absolutely fine.   Disregarding needs and putting yours first? What about the low libido partner needing a partner who doesn't cheat? How is cheating not putting your own needs over your partners?   If that's a deal breaker treat it like a deal breaker and end the relationship, don't go cheating.

Question:  How much Taylor Swift prophetic intercession has there been like this?  On the Twitter Page, there was pinned to the top, something like "Go here for more" and a link to Champions for Christ Facebook Page.  Given I made some Taylor Swift tweets or something controversial, new people would find me on Champions for Christ, and through God, I would answer questions at times. There were times I felt locked down in my apartment for several days when I felt I really got a big crowd that was really interested in the right way.  There ended up a lot of Taylor Swift Prophetic Intercession like this.  Some of it was deleted, and rebuilt, and deleted again.  Whatever is there currently is what is there.  Some of it became a little personal.   That stuff wasn't done again.  How much of it ended up being prophetic?  I don't know.  I was dwelling on God's Law and working somethings out with an audience.  That being said, I may not have had the bigger picture at the time.
I want that view in real life.
Very sad. Craig Smith, Jared Dudley, Sean Williams, and Tyrese Rice aren‚Äôt walking through that door.
First meme of the year! ~~Because of course you're all on UTC time, right?~~  Explanation: &gt;!`document.all` is a non-standard property introduced by early versions of Internet Explorer (IE). It returns an [`HTMLAllCollection`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#the-htmlallcollection-interface), which contains all elements on the current page as a flat list. In the early days of the Web, checking for the presence of `document.all` was a way to identify that the browser was IE. Knowing that the browser was IE meant that you could run code that should only run in IE, like workarounds.!&lt;  &gt;!Nowadays, browsers (including IE) are written in such a way that scripts using values in `document.all` won't break, but scripts that check for `document.all` won't mistakenly detect the browser as IE. They do this by letting `HTMLAllCollection` act as the falsy value `undefined` in many cases, including for `typeof` checks. In other words, the browser is lying to the script.!&lt;  Sauce: &lt;Komi-san wa Komyushou desu&gt;

It was a very quiet change they made in May. They're also trying to bring in a more interview-based system that's similar to the one straight people get re: safe sex. This is in-place in Italy. Too long coming but they are working on it. Lord knows, they want the blood.

Sure, but its 3 step build.  First I started mining with my normal LTD build: https://s.orbis.zone/5ib8   When I had everything full I reduced modules recollection drones and surface scanner to place cargo bays: https://s.orbis.zone/5ibb  In the end I only left a 1D refinery to process the LTD minerals: https://s.orbis.zone/5ibc  In total they were about 12-14 hours of work and risky without shields. The most difficult part was the last 24 t in manual mining mode.  As an additional fact: this cutter was set for combat. But I did not like it and modified weapons, auxiliary and internal options for mining.

Thanks man! I appreciate the answer. And I don‚Äôt mind  the chant but I just think we should have our own story thing.   And the people he was yelling at were in that case. But from where we were, you could see down the the ice just fine. It just annoyed me he was being a jerk about it.

Good thing I didn't, and the implication goes the other direction.  - "I've seen her criticize everything" -&gt; "It's expected that she'd criticize those.",   Not:  - "She criticized those three things, therefore she criticizes everything."
You're absolutely right.  But it doesn't justify withholding already approved funds as incentive to do so, nor does it justify suddenly deciding to do so as soon as Biden becomes a political challenger to him.  I'm all for investigating. Pretty sure you're not gonna find corruption in this case, but feel free. I'm *not* for extorting a foreign country to do our investigating for us, *especially* when the main incentive to demand the investigation seems to be individual political gain.
Thanks for the link - the difference is very noticeable. Will have to do this myself.

The origins are very blurred but while the Uralic peoples originated very early from Siberia they settled in and around the Urals. The proto-Magyars split off early on for lower Urals and the Pontic plain where they came to contact with a lot of Caucasian people (Iranian and Indo-European nomads) and mixed a lot with them. The Magyar bloodline diluted post 4th century quite some and was overwhelmed by the European people.  As you may know a loose connection is found with the Finns and Estonians, sharing the same language family, but other than that Hungarians have most in common with nearby Slovaks and Slavs with very little Asian and Central Asian remains. More Asian connections remain on the Romanian side Hungarians which possibly had less contact with outsiders because of the Carpathian mountains.  To sum up, yes they're supposed to be more Asian, but the original Uralic then Ugric peoples when migrating to the European side of the Urals mixed with Caucasians, basically forming the Magyars, which then slowly crept up on Eastern Europe to end up in Pannonia. Some even connect them to the Bulgars and Xiangnu (pseudo Huns) from Central Asia, so they're quite the heterogenous populace.

So you're telling me that Kieth sleeping with Deb was just as bad as Dan ditching Karen, abusing both Deb and Nate, abusing Lucas at times and even black mailing him in order to keep paying for his needed medical pills, threatening Whitey to get fired, and eventually killing Kieth?   lt's also forget that in season one Deb seperated from Dan and that throughout the next few seasons they weren't together and she was trying to get a divorce but Dan wouldn't let her and basically forced her to stay. Tried to turn Nate on her as well. This was before Keith slept with Deb.  Let's also not forget that Dan tried to get with Karen because Keith was with her and he felt guilty at what he had done.  You keep circling around comparing what Keith one time to what Dan did the entire series. It Keith a victim? Yes Dan shot him because he was jealous. You can't say that Keith sleeping with Deb is anywhere near what Dan did the entire series because it's not a comparable things at all.

I'd much rather the Dragon Warhammer be a rare drop from a demi-boss and a useful weapon rather than it being thrown in a shop after a Grandmaster Quest that required Level 80s; meaning that by the time you can equip it, it was useless. That said, there isn't a great reason for why Shamans have the Warhammer, but the same can be said for some other items (e.g. why do monkeys have the Scimitar and bugs have the Chainbody?).  Also, Dragon Claws makes a lot of sense to come from Raids seeing as they are very powerful and that Raids 1 is directly connected to the Dragonkin. The original implementation of the Harpoon, Thrown Axes, and Sword wasn't the best, but they have since resolved that and the new locations are much better. And unlike RS2 and RS3, at least OSRS makes the weapons either useful or valuable except for the Hasta instead of throwing them on endgame content where Level 60 items are long past the point of being relevant.  For example, in RS3, the Dragon Hasta, Knives, and Ward (a dragon shield for Magic...) are dropped by Muspah, which are unlocked from a Grandmaster Quest that requires 3 other Grandmaster quests... I'd say that is a bit worse than putting a Sword and Thrown Axes in Raids; at least those items were designed to be strong weapons even if it only panned out for hte Thown Axe.  As for TDs and the Platebody, my issue with it is had no reason to be there. It is fair to prefer it coming from a more involved monster, but since Mithrils dropped the Full Helm, it makes a lot of sense for Addy to drop the Kite and Rune to drop the Plate. And I also do think repairing a broken lump with a chainbody in the Dragon Forge to make the Platebody works a lot better than melting down 3 pieces of a demon to make a Platebody from scratch with a silly hammer; I think they claimed you are just repairing pieces of a broken platebody, but those are very clearly limbs from the TDs. I mean you can see its eye and horn, foot, and claw; that is not part of a broken platebody but raw lumps of Dragon metal.

When I was 11, this guy bullied me about my appearance. He talked about my hair being stiff (I‚Äôm black) and the fact that I didn‚Äôt wear Air Force 1‚Äôs, which were popular at the time. He called me Crimson Chin (from the fairly odd parents) because my chin was on the large side. This went on everyday for a whole school year. While I can laugh at the chin joke 12 years later, I felt pretty bad about myself at the time. I was already as insecure as the average chubby girl in middle school, but he added insult to injury by talking about every other one of my flaws. I‚Äôve since grown into my chin and he‚Äôs in prison now.

Definitely. There is a thousand other authors that deserve a spot here, if not more, but I guess the message is still the same from this infographic. Most of us see success as a race and think we wont make it for taking too long at something or starting late, but this is not the case. Even the most famous ones have to work their way to the top, and perseverance is always key. Not being recognized till your 30s or 40s+ is completely normal.

As long as you try it's pretty easy.   Quiz every week that has \~2 questions. He all but explicitly tells you what questions are going to to be on it. They are all pretty easy. I lost 1 point total on all the quizzes because I made an arithmetic error.  The midterm was harder than the final.  Questions are straight forward except for 1 or 2 of them on the midterm/final which are only slightly tricky.  Work out the problems that are done in class a few times. They are almost exactly in the format they will appear on quizzes/exams.

&gt; But the only reason people do that is because defending is actually difficult.  no its not.  defending isn't hard. it's that countering is incredibly easy and buildup play doesn't get rewarded in this game.  it then defaults to people sitting back and countering as to get the easier wins.

I think you should chew on that a little longer, I imagine you'd  agree that if a person is emotionally and mentally "ok",the person shouldn't require a paid professional to remain stable.  Remember we're not talking about "A person relying on significant others to overcome difficulties", a therapist is a person you pay for. It may not be an explicit objective for most methods, but it is a core part of what therapy tries to achieve.
Which gap do you mean?
I think it's a driver issue so it's just easy to eliminate those. Do update your bios anyway as that might be the issue I'm not the most knowledgeable about these things and if you're running a ryzen CPU you can often get better performance from it.

NTA people suck and behave in very selfish ways  when they think they can get away with it. Large stores at busy times are the absolute worst. The sense of entitlement some people possess absolutely astounds me.   BTW she knew EXACTLY what she was doing. She probably does this every time parking is inconvenient. Laughing at you is her way of casually dismissing you, even though you were absolutely right to call her out on her bullshit. People always expect to do whatever they want without consequences.   I find it funny that your guy had such a problem with you confronting her, since guys are prone to randomly correct strangers for any and every reason, if they should feel compelled to do so. If he regularly tells you what you can and can't do and gets too upset when you stand up for yourself, you might wanna take a few and assess that red flag.  Also, the police most likely won't do anything because it's private property. The police can only do so much in private parking lots.

Tekken 7 is a great game but imo Tekken 6 was better than Street Fighter 4 but it didn't matter because people loved that game and Tekken wasn't shining because Capcom was the big dog but now that Street Fighter V completely shit the bed during its first few years and MVC killed itself capcom has lost a lot of its allure. The rest of the competition just isnt as fun or exciting to watch. Tekken 7 is great on its own merits but I garuntee if Street Fighter V launched how it currently is with the Champion edition it would be a much more popular title and be a pretty serious competition. Tekken 7 was the right game at the right time.

I took H2 blockers exclusively when coming off my first course of PPIs (lansoprazole) back in September.  Specifically I took ranitidine for a couple weeks (before it was banned), then switched to famotidine and was taking it as my only acid blocker until December.  I was able to get prescription ranitidine again, but it wasn't cutting it.  I was just finding my reflux to continually get worse as time went on, even though I was as ever as vigilant with diet.  I suspect it was tolerance issues.  I restarted on a PPI recently.

&gt; Okay so here's a meta analysis on the subject: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797618774253 It explains that there is a 1-5 IQ point correlation regarding education, collected by 28 studies. I haven't read it so if you see issues with it point them out for sure. I doubt that people know other's intelligence levels to recommend them to go in certain directions. &gt;  &gt;   Did you seriously just cite me back exactly the same study that I cited to you? I mean WTF? I said to you, "Here's a study and it's problems" and you reply "But are there problems with this study?" Wtf am I even supposed to say? You have me stumped but like, What?!??   &gt; Idk what weird pictures means exactly   Then you've never looked at an IQ test. They're primarily patterns in abstract pictures.  &gt; My argument is that why many women worldwide aren't intelligent or even some that are and aren't pursuing education is caused by sexism and traditional societal norms.  Your argument is "Hey, do you see a problem with this paper that you said you see a problem with?"  &gt; Your last point seems to agree with mine - I think it's a worldwide measurement as well.  The chess world championship is, not the study.

Does Temperance when used by two WHMs at once stack? What about two Asylums? I have been using these with the assumption that they don't stack but I'd like to know for sure.  Also, just to confirm: when one Temperance and one Asylum are used together, their healing bonus stacks, is that correct? As Temperance gives a boost to the healing output, while Asylum boosts the received heals for anyone standing within it, right?

There is only one force acting on each support, you are interpreting it as both symmetrical components, as it looks like an equilateral triangle I would take the top two sides 'direction' to summate the force (cos45 I think) so it looks like 25kn down the left side and 25kn up the right side if that makes sense, this is all guesswork without a pen or paper
