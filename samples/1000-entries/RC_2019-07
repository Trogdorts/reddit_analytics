Just don't
The ceiling of Pregabalin is not exactly at 600mg, some take 1200mg and with tolerance do some dose even higher, but Pregabalin is generally more potent, especially for common doses and it´s true that if someone doses insane Phenibut amounts the effects intensify (also up to a ceiling) but those doses would be +10gpd and with tolerance even much further.  Withdrawal off normal doses of Pregabalin is very harsh tho, much harsher than what is to be expected from Phenibut and especially 600mg Phenibut that you took as an example to come off is such a low dose that you might get some anxiety and sleeplessness but not even much. It´s relatively easy to reduce Phenibut by taper generally (many here been there and done it) but lowering a daily dose of Pregabalin by even a small percentage (10-15%) can get really dramatic.

Yeah boiii
You can blame everything on porn, but you still made the conscious decision to masturbate (more than "just once") to abused children. In top of that you "seriously considered" raping children. What you did is not only wrong and bad, it is illegal and by watching these kind of child rape videos (it is nothing else. Porn is acted. Raping a child in front of a camera is not.) you contributed to the production of them by being a "consumer". You would have earned my respect if you tried to look for help BEFORE making bad decisions. You didn't. And now you act like you are the victim of the evil evil pornography industry that lured you into watching this kind of shit. Yes porn is bad. But no, porn does not make you watch children getting raped. And it also does not give you a free pass to do so. If you are truly sorry for what you have done (Which I doubt. You even seem to be pretty proud of yourself for not actually raping a child personally.) ,go to the police and tell them about everything.  And I find it alarming to say the least, how everyone seems to respect this person so much for not actually go out and raping a child.   Your self hate does not change anything. If you won't report yourself to the police and also tell them about where you found the videos you watched, AT LEAST seek psychological help to make sure children around you are safe.

Yeah because most drug crime is caught in lower classes. Those lower classes tend to be of a majority minority. It is racial profiling only in terms of class. The cops aren’t racist they just know who to look for based on the institutionalized “racism” as you put it.

Pretty much same. I prefer my female characters to be... well, actual characters, you know?

This item is in the same building of the mission. I forgot the floor exactly.
There is givemethevin.com that says they will beat a CarMax offer or give you $100. Not sure how their appraisals work.  That said, if you do CarMax you can take that offer across the highway to Henna Chevrolet and they will beat it by $500 within 7 days no questions asked.  I think another dealer says they will do $1000, but they keep the right to not buy it at all.  As for lending, I had good luck with UFCU.

The deep state is very real. It happens in countries when government institutions develop lasting relationships with business interests and establish an operating culture defined as a "status quo". Countries most prone to developing internal states are those with limited government accountability and lack of cohesive values.  In the USA, the deep state emerged post WW2 as a combination of Military Industrial Complex influence taking over forigen policy to promote rollback politics and continue abusrd defense spending. The Deep state continues to this day; and it's been very apperent that in the post cod war era, the USA is constantly trying to imagine up new enemies to preserve the status quo of "Us vs Them"  by undermining otherwise positive trade relations for the premises of "national security" or existential threats. Barking up the North Korea tree is normal if you look at history; none of it is meant to start a war, but it's mean to inflate threats, boost defense spending, alter public opinion to pass new security laws, and routinely purge the NSA/CIA/DOD of idealists, replaced with yes men and career politicians.   The DPRK hasn't bombed an ROK airliner, kidnapped, or assassinated an ROK citizen in years. They haven't given money/support to the PLO. They aren't a terrorist organisation.

Yes I'm Canadian, no I'm not biased against Georgians. I just found it hilarious how a person from SO in my above link was being told he was brainwashed for basically not wanting to be part of Georgia.

I wanted to point out that basically some of the people here(literal people on this sub) have driven themselves into some sort of bias confirmation where they are telling another nationality what they think but refuse to consider their own opinions subjective.

It's basically a work safety thing.  Lawmakers deem it manageable to lift 25kg of load without any mechical support. If you had to move heavier things, say 50-100kg, you are supposed to use tools to move it, trolleys and the like.  Now, moving trolleys around a construction site is a hassle, as is getting them up and down multiple floors of a building under construction, so the stuff is generally only sold in these bags - you just can't get them in bigger amounts basically, because bigger bags would require different tools on site, which simply aren't used.  Now if it is really *illegal* to sell cement in heavier than 25kg bags I can't confirm, but that's generally the reason why they aren't.
I'm sure he knows exactly where hes going already lol

Yea agree here... If you had a credit card or two with history of good payments you'd probably be in better shape. Not to mention opening a few over time to build your utilization ratio.

Honestly when I left therapy feeling uncomfortable (not the right word but I can’t think of something better) I knew I had a good therapist for me. Other ones had just let me vent or dump whatever on them but didn’t challenge me to actually acknowledge my role in the patterns.

I didn’t leave feeling “lighter” up front but it helped me do the work I needed to do at that point in my life

"Opinion"
It’s response to oppression, discrimination, and hate. They spent their lives denying or being ashamed of who they are. They don’t want to hide or apologize any longer. That’s why the term “pride” was chosen. This is why acceptance is so important. Love is love. I think we agree that it shouldn’t matter. The problem is, too many people (like this guy) think it does matter.

what are you even trying to say? BLS stopped counting people not looking for work, and we can see the percent of working age people declining, 4% since 2000 mind you. Retirees don't count in the percentage of working age people in the participating in the work force, as they are not of working age, and it the stat is based on percent of working age. Unemployment when accounting for people no longer looking for work, who don't have work, is somewhere between 8% on the low end and 22% on the high end.
I'm sorry to hear that you got a negative too. :(
Mother. Fucking. Campinos. If you don’t know about these lil fucks cause of my bad spelling or you’ve never had them then you are lucky. These little swirls of strawberry and cream sweets are the best things in the world. I remember their taste a good 14 years after my last one and since then I’ve never seen another. Some look similar but are mint flavoured and made by Satan to fucking test me. If I could have three wishes, each one would be for a fucking campino god I miss them.
I learned to drive in a stick shift and owned stick shifts for 10 years before buying an automatic.  In my first automatic I came to a screeching halt on the highway because I pushed in the “clutch” out of habit.  Pretty embarrassing...

That I hate girly stuff. Lol give me all that pink and glitter please, I've been starting to really allow myself to act more feminine because all my life my ex bff basically pressured me into acting like a boy because "girly girls are lame and stupid," lmao I can like skating and dresses, I can love guns and glitter, I can enjoy car shows and makeup vlogs, so to that bitch who basically forced me to be someone that I'm not, HA,   (rant incoming)   you're now a stuck up asshole that thinks youre better than everyone else because you went to private school for 2 years and now you're stuck in one of the fucking worst high schools in the damn state and hating everyone and everything, and I'm having a great time being optimistic and becoming a strong young girl so fuck yeah I'm glad I stopped listening to your sorry ass 🤘
I haven’t worn it yet! But I just saw the Auth in Nordstrom and it’s SO SO close to it! I’m super excited to rock it now! 🥰
Interesting username.
I bought this lodge 26cm in my mid twenties. I had no idea how to take care of it. It has had cold water run in it after searing steak, overheated every day, not cleaned properly. It was once left on high burn all night and had to be completely reseasoned. I was not the most responsible twenty-something. Despite that, the cooking surface is perfect, and I was lothe to strip a funtionally working pan. Lodge gets a 5/5 for tankyness.  Now I am in my mid thirties, and I thought I would try a lye restoration to get these years of crud off. After 4 days, there were still blotches of carbon that I had to sand off with an orbital sander. I ended up completely sanding the cooking surface so that is much smoother than it was before. I got a little lazy in my re-seasoning and left a bit too much Kremelta on the pan, so there is some leopard spotting. But after two weeks of use the pan is darkening. In a couple of months it will look just like its 30cm brother. I also have a 26cm carbon steel pan for quick eggs in the mornings.  Cat tax is Catbo. He's an affectionate asshole.

I have a HomePod but found lack of support and expense of products meant home automation won’t be very good with Apple. Amazon Dots are so cheap sometimes on offer I got one for every room at less price than a HomePod and they support more devices. So I’d go for that for home automation. I use HomePod for Apple music and a cooking timer!

Southern style cornbread dressing:  •2 pans of baked and crumbled cornbread   •Enough chicken broth to make the cornbread moist but not soggy   •A shit ton of black pepper, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano  •A handful of chopped green onion  •About a stick of butter  Mix everything together except the butter which will be sliced and put on top of the dressing.

It really freaks me out how some people seem to believe we've elected nothing but incompetent, ineffectual idiots for the last 50+ years but now we've finally found the genius who has finally solved foreign policy, and that person is Donald Trump!  There are reasons none of our past presidents, who by the way actually have had a high-level understanding of world politics, have not touched these meetings with NK.

&gt; Large exchanges do not run on a single CPU at all. They are spread out across multiple CPUs in different servers in different clusters in different availability zones  The frontend and other auxiliary services are, but I'm not aware of any actual matching engine that is spread out in multiple locations. Yes it makes sense to geo-locate and distribute services like the website and API features, but the actual matching engine &amp; orderbook of every exchange I'm aware of is all run off of one physical CPU. Do I have bad information? I don't know how EVERY exchange runs, this is just the direct experience I've had with two major players in the space. It was impressed to me that the nature of the sequential matching of trades that must be done linerally does not scale well even to multiple cores.

yes:  Never unplug the PS4 while the LED light is still on. When the PS4 is in Rest Mode, it is meant to stay powered. Sudden power loss can result in data corruption. That said, the PS4 consumes very little power while in Rest Mode, so it's not like it's bad to leave it like that. In fact, many people do regularly put their PS4s into rest mode so they can charge controllers, have save data backup automatically, automatically download updates, and quickly resume their game session without having to close it.  If you want to ***fully*** power off your PS4:  * Select **(Power) &gt; \[Turn Off PS4\]** from either the home screen or quick menu * Press and hold the power button for at least 7 seconds (until the system beeps twice). Letting go after only the first beep puts the PS4 into Rest Mode.  The white light will blink for some time, once it is off entirely and no longer blinking, then you can unplug your PS4 if you like.  So yeah, be mindful of Power Off vs. Rest Mode. If you never ever want your PS4 to be able to enter Rest Mode, go to  **(Settings) &gt; \[Power Save Settings\] &gt; \[Set Features Available in Rest Mode\]** and make sure every setting is off. If this happens, the PS4 cannot enter Rest Mode, and simply will power off instead in all scenarios.

The do score high on the goofiness scale and tend to have a knack for interspecies relations more than any other brand of cat  My vet would tell me no rush in picking up Charliy when I boarded him there. Seems the techs found that Charley had a calming effect on all the other animals, especially when feeding the kennel the first thing in the a.m.   He'd ride slung over their shoulder, looking out, and the animal would stop barking/sqwaking/wallering, whatever, as soon as he appeared in front of their cage.  He spent his days in the waiting room sprawled across the reception desk bringing calm instilling peace to any stressed out pupper and/or kitteh, even the biggest growler on a leash  And when one was freaking out in the exam room the call would go out Bring Charlie in here, and he'd sit sphinx-struck on the counter making the scene totally zen.  Sometimes I would drop him off on the way to work for the hell of it.  He was always welcome there  Charlie's fur   In Winters depth it's black as night   with a touch as soft as down  By summersun it's going gold   hints of yellow red and brown  And underneath the whitest white  except for dirty feet   My Knuckles gnawed   as I rub   his belly when in reach

Go back to school buddy...  I never said protests need to be convenient, nor does it has anything to do with anything. Blocking traffic is a violation of law, that's it, who cares if it's a protest. you want to create an "inconvenience"? find a lawful way to do it, or face the consequences. and the consequences are fucking pepper spray stop crying over everything you SJW Americans.. That's why activists go to jail and have issues with law, cause they are breaking it a lot, I don't think that you get the point of protests actually... and yea buddy you can get permits for legal protesting if you don't want to be dispersed. like do you people don't know that? I don't get it don't you people like watch news and shit? havent you ever been blocked by a LEGAL protest blocking main roads? havent heard of news sources warning on protests like that so people wont get caught in traffic? Americans today are just a joke, no wonder your "protests" end up as straight out terrorism and looting.

Sorry,  i was just joking
The smogon article is talking about Gen 4 and using imperfect IVs (30/22/30/30/30/31), I'm talking about full 31/31/31/31/31/31. With a 31 IV and 4 EV, the calc from that article is [(31 + (4 ÷ 4)) ÷ 2] = (31 + 1)/2 = 16. The reason the HP is wasted in the Kyogre example is because it has a 30IV and doesn't add to an even number. In the current gen it matters less because Hyper Training exists so everything can be perfect, but it's the same mechanics even back then. To quote smogon, "As you can see, it is important for the sum of every IV and four EVs to be an even number, otherwise you are wasting EVs." With 31 IVs and 4 evs, you have 1 set of 4 so that adds to 32. With 31 IVs and 12 EVs, you have 3 sets of 4 and that adds to 34. You have to add 8 each time to add another stat point.  An IV calculator is about putting in your visible stats and getting the IVs from them, if you change the EVs there it's going to change the possible IVs not the actual stat, which calculates with different ranges. You'd use a stat calculator to calculate stats from given IVs and EVs.  You can go on pokemon showdown, set a pokemon to level 50 and check yourself with the current mechanics.

A new mechanic hardly compensates for certain Pokemon not being in the game at all. There doesn't need to be gimmicks added every gen for Pokemon to be interesteing. They could, you know, add more original Pokemon instead of just 60-70 along with a new ultimately unpopular mechanic.

I live in Germany and a quarter of my paycheck goes straight to the government, along with 19% of what I pay for most goods (7% for food, ~60% gas ect.).  Sure, you don't have to get your wallet out when you go to the general practitioner. Provided you pick one that works with the insurance company.  Want a specialist that costs more than public healthcare is willing to pay? Guess what, you're SOL. They'll either pay a fraction or nothing at all.  Same goes for meds, equipment ect.. You'll either get the cheapest stuff on the market or have to pay extra.  Socialized healthcare sounds great on paper, reality is that the entire system aims to provide the necessary minimum to *everyone* while a fraction of the population has to foot the bill whether they want to or not.  Germany has the highest GDP in Europe, but the second lowest wealth per head because the state "socializes" everything, and the money has to come from somehwere.
I've had customers do this and I'm fine with it. A cash tip is preferable to online for us (don't need to report on taxes) but the customer can get screwed by not pre tipping because their 7 dollar no tip batch will float around all day till IC puts a big peak boost on it. The customer isn't screwing you over by tipping online and then replacing it with cash.

We already know that the Trump campaign colluded with Russians (again - this has been publicly admitted); they just didn't find evidence that the colluded with the Russians specifically on the identity theft and troll farming. We also know that the Trump campaign accepted money from non-allied foreign governments, and that Trump appointed people in the pay of hostile foreign governments (like Flynn) to national security positions.  Mueller at no point stated he didn't have enough evidence to prosecute the Trump campaign. He was legally prevented from doing so.

To elaborate on the don’t overwork it, avoid back and forth brushing. Think about it like applying, not painting. Apply it in one direction with the tiniest overlap. You can make up for coating inconsistencies with multiple coats.  You can thin with mineral spirits, but just a bit.  If it’s water based poly on top of oil based stain you need to seal coat with something like dewaxed shellac. I’ve never done that but it’s what I’ve heard works.
Yeah, what we can't do is check if helmet goes well with any other skin we don't have already. Would be nice feature.

His "proof" is apparently that the "most famous atheist of the world" (Hitchens) "asked God for forgiveness on his deathbed".   If that doesn't convince you, consider his strawman argument that atheists believe "something came from nothing".   Not sure why apologists like WLC even show up to debate atheists and skeptics when he should just send OP.

I don’t think she needs surgery. Looks like she has ab separation(recti diastasis is the technical name) it’s pretty common for moms to have(I got it with both my kids really bad). It’s pretty easy to fix yourself if you work at(took me about 4 months with each kiddo to fix my gap) or you can see a physical therapist to help you with the exercises that fix it if your having issues on your own fixing it.   With that said she’s probably made it worse by working her abs to hard. You have to work up to crunches and extreme ab work outs and instead strengthen the core slowly or it makes it way worse(which I imagine is the case here for her abs). So most moms don’t realize this and wonder why their abs never look right when they are working out a lot.
Might as well not wear clothes or goggles then!  I dunno, I’d rather look stupid than be stupid.

No problem. Papillary thyroid carcenoma. I went to the doctor after having a swollen lymph node for roughly 3 months. Turns out I had thyroid cancer and that spread to a chain of 28 nodes in my neck. Two weeks later I was under the knife for a full thyroidectomy and right next dissection. Followed by 2 treatments of radioactive iodine. I'm alive and it's been gone for 3ish years.

You don’t need to tell her that, you can just say you don’t think you’re compatible and fully attracted to her. Tattoos are a personal appearance preference, and while you aren’t obligated to accept them on someone you’re dating I think it’s considerate not to make your problems hers too.

I think a big part of the Dark Souls attraction is that its practically zero bullshit. No 30 minute long cutscenes, no big HUDs exclaiming "GET IT HERE" in neon letters over targets, no ads or distracting microtransactions. No endless fetchquests or scrounging and sifting through hundreds of low value items. No bafflingly long and seemingly pointless dialogue trees... Its all "meat."  When you start the game, its get busy time.

Good question!  Another question, why do you need antihistamines to sleep? Another question, what quality of sleep is it under the influence of antihistamines. I know whenever I take them it’s a heavy and not refreshing sleep.

I love and trust dogs more than most people! It was sad but I was able to understand the decision they had to make. I would not want to make her suffer by living in a cage for the rest of her life and I would not want to see someone be seriously hurt or killed because she didn’t know better. It wasn’t her fault but the people responsible were tracked down and prosecuted for cruelty to an animal and possessing a dangerous animal. Not sure about the dangerous part as Doberman’s can be very loving and loyal but in her state yeah she was dangerous even deadly.
It’s been better but life continues. Much love.
Your comment was to stop protecting gun owners who break the law, but the article you referenced is about a woman being arrested for breaking into her (ex?) husband's house, stealing his guns, and turning them into the police. I'm not connecting the dots between your comment and the article. I assume my confusion has to do with a different interpretation of the article than yours? I just want to understand where you're coming from.
I just bought the game haha

I guess it depends on your kids and you. In my opinion if your kids are skipping other opportunities and positive experiences for gaming it might be excessive. It would be tough to say a set time period as I don’t know your bourses dynamic. But, I would say there’s no point to those positive skills your kids are gaining if they can never utilize them in the real world.   Just my two cents tho.

It definitely would not have the rap section and I think it would’ve had PermWaves-like synth touches and a stronger punchier bass tone from the Rickenbacker/FJ. Alex’s solo would’ve probably had a little more aggression. I don’t think the lyrics would’ve changed that much in meaning but Neil would have definitely phrased a lot of the same stuff in different ways. It would probably sound similar to Different Strings and Entre Nous.

HAHAHHAHAHA I’m dead  And nah I only looked at this video lmfao  You seem pretty dumb, any analytic that shows your views are from search would be completely untrusted because there’s no way for a system to be able to track from a search, to the results page, to the clicked video, when any link literally emulates the searching process. All you did was admit your views come from your self promo on here.   Again, lots of ad hominem in your comment. It’s pretty yikes but it’s also pretty funny seeing how mad you got. Also, i really don’t comment that much, and if I do it’s hardly ever trolling or mean, so I don’t get your point. If that’s spending all day on Reddit to you, than all you’ve done is show you literally only come on Reddit to spam your shitty videos, which I’ve already known anyway.

I think he's saying the mechanical basis is heavy into the combat and light on the non combat rolling. Most of the rules in the game apply to combat.

&gt;You merge when it's least detrimental to traffic  That's another, and taken together *and* in context.  &gt;**Merging early is right up there** with yielding your right of way **for the dumbest fucking thing you can do on the road.**  Hyperbole aside, merging early is the best choice if there's room in the lane for that to happen. Think cars traveling 25 MPH with about 15 car lengths between them for an easy visual. In this case, one cannot merge early, and that creates a fine bottleneck up front that we can expect.  For a better weigh in we'll need footage of what happened before. It's reasonable for that person to drive all the way up and merge when indicated by barriers or by the paint. They should not have been blocked. At the same time, if they could have merged earlier and chose not to, they are wrong. That also depends if they knew, otherwise you can't call someone an asshole for not having specific knowledge of a turn.

I’m holding they use him at the trade deadline to pick up another solid player that’s locked into a 3 year deal or so from a team that’s drowning in tax and wants to clear space at the end of the season.
push the values more and work on proportions, great work though!!
Just wait for an asshole customer that wants upstairs delivery but has no legal parking.  Hit the timer when you pull up.  When they refuse to make the 15 minute trip down, you get free food.  If they threaten you, you get free food. If it takes them longer than 5 minutes to get to you, you get free food.
Actually, just picking up bpm is quite easy.

Eh, the comment version (I just copy pasted it into a post) got a positive response, and I thought it was decent enough to merit a shit post. Maybe the context of the comment made it better. Shit posts are pretty hit or miss.  ... Although, it is supposed to be a satirical take at how Reddit/Smash community over-reacts, stirs up drama, and demands dumb shit. So, if it's cringey I think I hit the nail on the head.
All I did this week was rewatch **Toradora**. I'm not going to spoiler tag the whole comment, just stop reading if you somehow haven't seen it.  Not much to say about the show its self that hasn't been said, but I was reading the comments each episode and hoo boy it was a toxic wasteland full of ship wars and people missing the point.  I challenge anyone to change my mind on one thing: Ami was never a contender for a romantic interest. Right from her being introduced, she was antagonistic at worst and unhelpful at best. She started off only "wanting" Ryuuji to bother Taiga and even after she dropped that, it was established that all she wanted was friends. Her actions back that up, since after the group takes her in she acts more like a good friend, but still pretending to keep a distance, than a romantic interest for anyone.   Rewatching didn't really change the experience all that much for me despite how long it's been since my first watch. Overall, I still say this is an **8/10**.

this is the cutest goddamn thing I've seen all week. And last week.
Oh how the times have changed... :(
In an extended cut of the first film, it's revealed that the alien has taken a couple of the crew captive and is preparing them for the facehuggers suggesting it may have been a potential queen.   As for the second point, the only counter I have is maybe the queen ordered them to somehow. Paper thin, but the best I got.
It makes it a little more difficult but it'll still be in your temp directory if you navigate to it. Even if you force-close Kodi and restart it should be under kodi.old.log.  &amp;#x200B;  As far as you're question I don't use Gaia or Elementum anymore but I had some issues with Elementum a long time ago with Gaia 3.x which required me to install a different version than that was in Gaia's repo. I doubt this is even related. Good luck.
Maybe it was on Reddit:   I remember reading how whole town get chosen to be near a new highway, or big ores by it, given no exit, swirled around, passed up or lobby to keep it from their competing towns.  I never pictured the politics in highway placement, but avoiding towns and letting them dry up is brutal

Blow what up lmao
Room temp water can go and fuck off. We have a chilled water tap at work, and a nearly boiling water tap for tea/ coffee etc.   I saw a work colleague of mine fill a glass almost 3/4 full with the cold water, and then top it off with the hot.   Yer man says “the cold water is too cold” and I about threw up.   Who in hell prefers lukewarm water?  Water cant be too cold. Ill drink it fresh outta a glacier after brushing my teeth, with crushed ice, on a cold day. I dont give a fuck boi, ill drink liquid nitrogen, I want it fuckin COLD.
It is very frustrating. It’s playing chicken with what’s closed. I live in castleton, work near the airport and i tell my boss that I’m not meant to work the weekends due to the closures (and fake closures). He won’t let me skip though.

I wonder if the Americans will want something in return, or if Trump just got convinced by Putin to do it (not very difficult, Trump listens to whomever talked to him last, see: him announcing a pullout after talking with Erdogan, Erdogan being like oh shit maybe slow down, and then after domestic pressure Trump changes his mind)?
When I was 13 I loved nba jam. At the time I played with Robinson and Duncan and I believe Elliot was the other. I loved playing with the spurs more than any other team always dunking like crazy.

I gotta say something, what happened to this term? I feel like it got co-opted really quickly. When I first heard it the friend who said it told me " like, think Anthony Bourdain". The way I saw it used after that seemed to line up with that idea.   It seemed like the term was originally meant to refer to the things that were masculine/masterful without being "toxic". Like a guy with BDE is the sort of guy who respects women but also gets laid a lot cuase he's actually cool. has confidence backed up by knowledge and skills. Knows the difference between what's good and what's expensive/popular. He respects and understands people from all classes and endeavors to understand any new ideas he's confronted with. He gets discounts and things comped when he's out on the town (he is most certainly a cosmopolitan) without ever asking, becuase clerks and waiters feel his respect and genuine nature. He makes an entrance without making a scene, if you know what I mean.   Last two weeks I keep on seeing it referring to classic rape-y Ferrari driving provide zero value or utility to society assholes. It really bugs me cuase I liked the old meaning, it felt like a step towards society becoming more aware of the signifier vs the signed, the whole "don't listen to what men say, watch what they do" thing

There is a marriage.. i dont remember the title
I like my parents. They do rely on me financially and it’s an odd situation. I don’t provide for them all the time but I need to be able to at a moments notice with rather large amounts, and not providing for them financially would have had very negative consequences at times. When I say I provide for them I mean my husband and I do. I don’t work because my husband doesn’t want me to, although he occasionally complains and demeans me for not having an income. I have worked on and off since I’ve been married but my husband doesn’t consider the amount I can bring in with my education and line of work to be worth my working. He will still say I don’t bring in money even when I’m working because it’s a small amount compared to him, and I still have to do the house work as though I’m not working. My husband makes a very good amount of money.   My husband is alright but comes from a very male dominated culture and definitely believes women should serve men and the man is the head of the household and should be served. I knew him as friends for 5 years before we started dating but he didn’t show this side of himself (and always said how modern he was and how those older ideals weren’t right) until we were married. He does have quite a temper and doesn’t allow me to ever be unhappy with him,  basically. If I ever show disapproval or get mad at him it’s a screaming fight from him. If I say no to serving him (getting him drinks while he watches TV, massaging him, etc.) he ends up picking a fight about something else within minutes and screaming and then giving the silent treatment until I apologize. He basically treats me the way he treats servants in his country. He can be loving, fun, and cute, but there’s always the underpinning that there could be screaming  at any moment. I think he has NPD as well but he’s not diagnosed.   I’m 31. Married 4 years.   I own horses and go horseback riding. Typically my husband is ok with this but with occasionally complain that I’m not keeping up with my household duties and not being inside the house enough (even though the house is clean and 80% of the time I’m home when he’s home). I live in an area that I can’t do the horseback riding that I want though. I also like swimming in the ocean in summer and going to garage sales and thrift stores. My husband’s mother recently did my horoscopes again and his family isn’t allowing me to swim without my husband’s supervision or go to garage sales or thrift stores at all anymore due to increased risk of drowning death (somehow buying used things plays into this, I’m not sure how). I don’t actually believe that stuff though.   I was a nanny for 10 years. I am a part time doula and I am also a midwife assistant, although I can’t find a position doing that near me. I want to become a certified professional midwife but unfortunately there aren’t any preceptors near where I currently live and that’s a requirement.   My parents live on the other side of the country (USA) and I don’t really have any friends since moving out here 7 years ago. I have one horse friend I trail ride my horses with 1 - 2 times per week.   Off to apologize to my husband for him screaming at me for saying he was treating me like a servant again as he bosses me around..   Thanks.

Thank you all for the advice. I’ll add a few new things to my tennis bag for future matches.
Yeah you're totally right if you just ignore all the teams that have had success due to tanking! Like the Sixers who were a bounce away from the ECF. Or the Pelicans who seem poised for a quick rebuild. Or the Lakers who have two top 5 players from trading assets they got while tanking?  And don't forget the Knicks got RJ and have a bunch of young guys who have shown potential. Sure they won't be good next year, but with some lottery luck and cap management it's possible for them to turn it around in the near-ish future.
&gt; EVs are simpler to produce than ICE cars with far fewer parts and and are less complex.  Completely disagree.  EVs would be easier to assemble, but only if the standard parts existed.  Unfortunately they don’t.  Big auto need to develop battery pack technology, which is new.  They have little to no expertise in this area. They need to develop power electronics, which they also have little to no expertise in.  A good example is the Audi etron.  The product is uncompetitive because Audi lacks EV drivetrain expertise.  Weight is high.  Efficiency is low.  Batteries are large but range is pretty short.  As a result it’s really expensive for what you get.

The other sister-in-law did the baking, but next time I see her I'll try to remember to get it from her. It was a white cake with American buttercream and raspberry filling.   All the decorations we're done in Swiss buttercream (held up better in the heat and less sweet). That recipe is from https://natashaskitchen.com/swiss-meringue-buttercream-recipe/#jump-to-recipe  The macarons were standard shells with homemade lime curd. That recipe is from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/150642/fresh-lime-curd/  Hope that helps a bit.

I'm young and myself and my friends all have stable careers now and are contributing members of society. The incident I'm referring to happened at another friend's house, I was not there, and it was years ago when we all did stupid shit while drinking, smoking or whatever in our college years. I'm sure it wasn't funny at the time, but we're at a place where it is now. It'll pass.  Good people do stupid shit too, but I agree with you. It's not productive to be friends with shit people.  When I was at a not so good place mentally, I did some really embarrassing shit while drunk. But it doesn't define me. I know who I am now and I do my best not to take myself too seriously. I think it's fair to give other people that chance too if deserved

It’s not about being straight or gay. Some humans get off on the power and sadism, whether or not they’d be interested in the victim for vanilla sex. For example, very few child rapists are actually pedophiles. It’s a crime of opportunity. You see this in wars as well, soldiers who have always been straight but will rape or sexually assault same sex enemy prisoners. It’s not about their sexuality. It’s about the power they feel over another human being.

Space Pirate Trainer is surprisingly good considering how simple it looks.  I think there's a free demo - give it a shot.  &amp;#x200B;  What I am finding is that originally, I played it for like 2 minutes played through about 5 levels that all seemed the same, used one weapon, and left.  &amp;#x200B;  Every few levels there is a new enemy type, and  at some point you get comfortable switching weapons in it and it becomes really really fun (Switch both weapons to the laser, then aim both controllers at an enemy and make the laser's overlapp and you get a 'super laser' that blows up simple enemies instantly)  &amp;#x200B;  The other thing I like about Space Pirate trainer is that I can enjoy playing it for 3-15 minutes at a time.

i think you do plan on being around for a long time. you would not care about paying off debts if not. do not do something that you may regret or that others will feel. if there is an issue man, talk to someone. DM us. go see a therapist. find a friend. there is always a light out there somewhere, sometimes you just got to get out from the shade to see it
I think it's more of the under load, which I didn't elude to, so my fault. For example, running BFV full, it's butter smooth, however the CPU peaks at 93C.   I have the radiator (h150i pro) pulling in from the front and exhaust through two fans in top and exhaust through one in the rear.   [https://imgur.com/K4a7Gy8](https://imgur.com/K4a7Gy8)

I like to mount mine in the next room over. This is true for my kitchen, utility room (hvac, water heater), and garage.  I had an old truck catch on fire. Had the extinguisher been in the garage my whole house would have burned down. I kept one in my dining room, and was able to run and get out and put the fire out before anything else caught fire.  I have a nice pic of a smoldering truck now.
Try changing the screen touch sensitivity in Settings. It helps a bit.

Ah ok I was confused. The HA in this is the only one in my routine I think. I tried HA on its own and didn’t think it did much. I also think was just doing too much at that point and cut it down a bit now.

Will always respect JV for never pouting or never failing to play with good energy and hustle. Dude would get treated like ass by Casey but he tried his best with whatever time he could get.   So what if he wasn't the best defensively? How many posters dunks did that dude catch in the face? That shows while he wasn't always quick or athlethic enough to get the stop he still tried his best. Respect JV, and I hope he has a long lucrative career.
I learned something today; thank you!
Next year, I hope

How much per square foot?  Edit: A penny is .75 inches thick (16 per foot). 16 squared is 256, but you may need some extra room, so let's say 15 X 15 or 225 per square foot.
What server are you on and in what hours do you usually play on? EUW is only playable between minight and 7-9am without any disruptions.

A bit in the post showing people how to add it to their posts and their degree info to their user would probably get you more of what you want.  Going to go try to figure out how to add it to my user right now...
NAH...BUT, your fiancé also needs to learn how to deal with conflict. There are easier ways to empathize/listen to someone than telling them to shut up, especially a young adult. Maybe he can listen to your sons point and guide him on ways to communicate with his sister.

Listen, I’m glad there are people who want systems that are completely pacifistic, but that doesn’t represent everyone. And it would be impossible to achieve a system without wrongful death when there will always be people who support war, death sentences. etc. If you try to fight that systematically, you would probably be risking your life. I’m not opposed to the ideas you have. I just don’t think they can be executed properly. Could you please stop being rude, though? I am trying to have a civil discussion and you are insulting me. That’s your right, but it’s not making me want to agree with you.

Using this [wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_by_country), I looked at each country's first-level administrative divisions (with a few exceptions, such as if the divisions listed primarily serve as statistical or geographic regions instead of governmental divisions) and determined which ones could be traced in such a way that you'd visit each one without visiting any twice. If separate entities of a country were large or significant enough they were considered separately, and those are listed on the image itself and indicated with an asterisk. Otherwise, noncontiguous exclaves or minor islands were not considered. Plenty of countries have special administrative districts designated for the capital and sometimes other cities (e.g., Washington DC or Australia's ACT); since these are clearly different than a traditional state or state-equivalent, I made a sub-category (light green) for the countries which can have a Hamiltonian path drawn so long as it's allowed to not visit these small one-city-only districts.  Going into this, I knew the US couldn't be done but I didn't how rare/common that would be. In the end, it looks like 18 full countries and 3 significant sub-portions of countries cannot create a Hamiltonian path.  **EDIT**: For those who don't know why this is called Hamiltonian, it's based on the [Hamiltonian Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path) from graph theory and mathematics.

There are a shocking number of men in this thread who think their sexual pleasure is more important than their partners' health. And not just their sexual pleasure, but their entitlement to peak pleasure ("it feels better!").  OP--red flag. I don't care if every man you're with does it. It's a red flag every single time.

I always order 12 plants, which is the max I can order without an import license, so i haven't gotten any freebies. I've heard of people getting them before, so its not crazy haha  Longest I've waited is usually a week from the time they ship to the time they deliver. A friend of mine got her order stuck in customs once, which ended up being there for 30 days before releasing. Sucks, but customs can do that. All but I think 1 plant survived. They just needed light :)
Check out Monday night raw

That doesn’t really apply, because that’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying politicians often inflate issues to advance their agenda (bush and saddens alleged stockpile of weapons, for one)
Didn't even know half of these items, not including the new items.

Nah, it's not just you.
That sounds like a plan!  Edit: After talking further privately with /u/HeiligeHans, I'm not comfortable asking you to include any form of breath play without someone else present who could intervene if something went wrong. I know you said you like that kind of play, and I have experience with it in person, but I think it's a poor idea to do by yourself.  So while I wish we could indulge both the pet and breath control things you like, I'd ask you to just omit the collar/leash stuff for now.

There where some scenes that I really liked, but also some I hated. Sadly there are more scenes that I dislike than like. For example I didn't like space Leiah, or how Luke changed. His last scene was cool though. Since I've seen TLJ I can't get hyped for Star Wars. Before that even at the beginning of TLJ with the melody and everything I used to get goosebumps. Hope episode 9 can fix that again.

Yes people can have their opinions, and people can point then ostracize those whose viewpoints are antithetical to a free society.  See, you might think it necessary to tolerate and placate people that would remove and annihilate entire segments of society though non-violent or even violent means.  I, however, think that these people are more dangerous than they are given credit for, almost to the point where the entirety of right wing ideologues support their existence by simply saying "oh they just have a different opinion, you need to be nice to them".  I even some tacit agreement with the lamentations of the white-ethnostatists by other right wing ideological flavors. It doesn't even just apply to race either, but LGBT as well.  The larger right has been needing to find a new token gay since Milo was so maybe this will be what propels Andy into Milo's old position.  Though Andy doesn't seem to have the same derision for LGBT as Milo did so maybe he won't gain traction.

If you haven't yet, check out [It Could Happen Her](https://www.itcouldhappenherepod.com/)e which is a podcast by Robert Evans (a conflict journalist) about the very realistic possibility of a second US Civil War extrapolated from current events.   It impeccably researched, not at all sci-fi and is deeply, deeply chilling.   Robert Evans was actually at this protest livetweeting, but in the podcast (recorded in the last 6 months or so) he actually points out that Portland is a great microcosm for the conservative/liberal divide in America, being a highly liberal urban area surrounded by deeply conservative agricultural land, and says if anything major is going to kick off, it'll kick off there.   Also in his scenario one of the main 'triggering' events for the second Civil War is a shooting at a protest against a set of mass deportations by the Trump administration (which is happening, like, next week).   So basically, stock up on canned food and water folks

Picasso wasn't well received initially, nor was Campbell's soup. Both are now lauded as fresh and a new direction and brave and what not, both are "ART" whatever the fuck that means but shouldn't be directly compared unless your blood is in fact blue.   The fact that someone from a Comedy background was asked to line up against a very very competent Journo says more about the actual competition than the competitors.  The olympics wouldn't put Michael Jordan against a chess player in a surfing contest... why the fuck is everyone forgetting the Gold logeeeeee is a popularity competition and not a competence one.
I look at photos wherever I see them, whether they're on Instagram or even in a magazine. Sometimes photos I've seen pop back into my head and when I'm taking my own photos, or even editing them and I try to include a bit of that style into my photography from memory. I used to study them on DeviantArt but I think what's helped me the most is a photography club I joined about 2 years ago; they pick apart everyone's photos to such detail that it really helps you improve your own images.

Slow practice is always the answer.  Like   S L O W   slow slow slow  Painfully slow. Like a slow bicycle race. Slower than you believed was possible.  Then gradually increase speed.  Edit: And when you’re doing slow practice, do it EVEN with passages you know well. If you’re practicing slow, practice EVERYTHING slowly. Not just the tough bits.   Slow practice was the single most difficult obstacle I ever had to overcome when figuring out tough music. I have a need for speed and I think we all do.

I'm a construction worker, been doing it a while. I think we should be forgiving student loans since the government policies in place are what drove up the cost. Also the predatory nature of alot of these online colleges has driven alot of young folks to falsely believe they could afford the loans they signed on for. Misleading information such as the cost of future years tuition, the amount financial aid will cover, the transparency of what is included in the class. All of these things contribute to impoverishing tons of people who given the proper information would not have taken out loans and would be making far more money without a degree and thereby contributing more to the tax system. If you want to get upset let's get on to the fact the president kept tax breaks for businesses and corportations while eliminating tax breaks for the middle class.

Yeah, a lot of projection going on here, I think.
I'm still extremely optamistic. The owners have said they are willing to go into the luxury tax and I can see why they wouldn't over pay Brogdon. We made it to the ECF without him. We knew Middleton was gonna get almost the max. We were all worried about losing Lopez. We got our 3 and d center back for around the price everyone hoped for. We got trade assets now with the picks. People get lost in that 50/40/90 stat. Brogdon was not the biggest key to this team. Let Horst do his job. Hell did we forget about the development of DJ that never saw the floor in the playoffs or Captain hustle known as Donte DiVincenzo. Relax people.  Edit. We also have that Giannis guy who only seems to get better every year and once he starts shooting 40% from 3 next year. Will win 5 MVPs in a row.
I had a call once from a stranger looking for someone called Steve iirc. I don't know a Steve. The guy was awfully confused that I didnt know where Steve was. Even after telling him he clearly had the wrong person... I dont think he quite got it... Anyway I hung up, he called back about fifteen minutes later to let me know he had got hold of Steve.... I don't know what he expected me to do with this information.
