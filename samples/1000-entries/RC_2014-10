You're absolutely attacking him personally.  &gt;John Boehner is a terrible leader and **about as mature as a 6 year old**.  &gt;**I won't even dignify him** by calling him a leader.  &gt;There's nothing else Boehner can do to against Obamacare, **except throw temper tantrums**  These are all personal attacks.  Moreover, your OP shows a lack of comprehension of the political system and a lack of historical knowledge, both about how the Congress operates and about Speaker Boehner's history as a representative.  I don't agree with many of his positions, but I am also able to look dispassionately at the man.

All I hope is that you understand how the money spent yields tangible returns. The allure of high-end performance is like a spell and often many features aren't ever used (or you pay for that last 10-30% bit of performance for up to double the price).  Oh, you should get WIndows 8. It will have many years more of security updates over 7.
One of the artifacts Vash brought (the one that contained the energy creature) caused power drains on the Ganges and later on the station. It's not unreasonable to imagine that the artifact would also give off some sort of radiation or interference that would prevent a transporter lock, but no footage of anyone saying so was available to put into the *Q-Less* installment of the documentary.

I haven't run mine with a dual coil yet. The air hole ring (if you aren't familiar) has holes on 2/3rds but is solid on the other third. You're able to turn the holes so that one is blocked if you choose, while still having access to the various hole sizes near your coil.
Bonus points if they lull you into a false sense of security and the softer new designs are WAY more dangerous than the freaky, decomposing originals. Like, with newer technology they should be smarter and react to your game play like Freddy. The devs could totally run with this and have the original ones be more aggressive initially then boom, the newbies come out to play.
First of all the premise of your argument relies on the assumption that every reported tweet about a team's actions is 100% true.   You know, just like I know, that over half of those reports aren't accurate.   Front offices are supposed to guage interest from other teams In their players when trying to rebuild/retool like Dallas has been over the past few years.   Failing to do so is a betrayal to the fans and staff.   There's a giant difference between gauging interest and actively offering the player to other teams, which didn't happen  TLDR Your case is built on rumors. 
Either way you're getting pussy

That's what she said. 
We did get outplayed, but just enough to get beaten. Little things like a shoelace tackle on Kap as he was about to escape the pocket, or Boldin drawing a PI penalty when Flacco threw up a duck. And that second half kickoff return was a killer.

A weapon infused with a certain element and buffed with the same element (lightning weapon + Sunlight blade) will pretty much always be stronger than a buffed mundane weapon until you reach an absurdly high level, and even then it's elemental damage type vs physical damage type. I would stick with the elements until you hit upper 600's
I'm split.  I strongly dislike language that carries implied prejudice, even if it's minor, because language impacts everything.  It's the reason comments like "runs like a girl" etc are problems.  So I find "minor" shit like that *really* annoying and am strongly PC about it.  But what I'm not PC about is protecting people from themselves.  We need to be taking more responsibility for our actions across the board.  And the PC tendency to buffer, pad and warn about everything pisses me off...

If you're looking to reload, consider something called .22 K-Hornet. It's like .22 Hornet, but with a sharper shoulder and a straight body.

We'll see how those 3-D printers work out.  They don't exactly print themselves... yet.  Not even the RepRap can do that, even though some people are trying very hard to make that happen too.  That is why I think it will need to be much more primitive tools that make tools.  I don't think it needs as much "modern technology" as you suggest.  This is also why I think pulling up technologies of the past, things that worked doing similar things to what will be needed on Mars, will likely be needed.  Ignoring those ideas and concepts in favor of systems that will easily break down and require a supply chain from the Earth is going to be far more dangerous than simply using systems that may require more manual labor but can be made from basic local materials.  BTW, this is the philosophy that is being used in the design of the Inspiration Mars mission.  They are purposely including systems that may not have so much in the way of advanced electronics and technology in favor of things that may require some physical labor to operate but can be fixed in space with few parts or even machined on the spot.  Life support systems in particular are being made in a way to also occupy the time of the crew so they are in effect an integral part of the system.  I anticipate it will be that way on Mars too.  Besides, I think you are too dismissive of the technology of the 19th Century.  They weren't exactly cavemen scratching their behinds with their stone flint axes.  Railroads, steamships, telegraphs, and even a digital computer was built using that technology.  They also had at the time the ability to take some basic tools and move into a wilderness to create whole new cities in a matter of just a few years using local resources, which is a skill that hasn't really been needed since.  I think there is a thing or two we could learn from our ancestors about how they did that.
well, its true that its higher than it was, it usually hit 42-44c at its peak, now we're at 48c? I believe we've seen 50c in Anarchy tho?

Thanks for your compliments and reading through my wall of text. I don't have many plans after high school. I'm just in AP because it was expected and, for the most part, I like the topics. There's not much that can happen for me in terms of financial aide because my father (someone who is legitimately psychopathic) is making at least six figures a year. As for scholarships? I don't fit into the caliber of excellence needed for a scholarship.   I was vaguely thinking about getting my CNA license for free through the school and then saving up enough money to go get an RN or something like that. Seems like that's what all of my old classmates are doing, they've even asked me why I'm wasting my time in all of these classes :P.   If the world was perfect I'd be a Human Geography lecturer or some kind of upper level history teacher, but the world isn't perfect and I wouldn't like grading papers. And if it was really perfect I'd just be a housewife :).

It doesn't seem rational to skip CV1 only because Crescent Bay wasn't as large a leap as DK1 -&gt; DK2.  What would it have taken to "wow" you?  The problem here is that Crescent Bay is essentially feature-complete.  DK1 to DK2 was as revolutionary as you described because DK1 was lacking so many necessary features for good VR.  Now that most of the missing pieces are in place, we will only see incremental improvements in the headset itself.  Eye tracking and foveated rendering are a couple of features that could elevate CV2 over CV1, but they aren't as fundamentally important as something like positional tracking or low persistence.  The tick-tock development cycle mainly applies to chip makers who march to the beat of Moore's Law.  Coincidentally, that's where you should be looking for the next "revolutionary jump" in VR.  We need GPU tech that runs smaller, faster, and cooler than ever before if we're going to be able to drive the sort of experience that you crave.

Also appraisals are not zoning/code checks.  They are about value.  Maybe the guy should have seen it as an issue originally, but they very much are not in charge of inspecting every characteristic of the property.  Fire inspections are for fire issues.  They give two shits about the use laws and zoning.  They want to make sure there is fire separation etc.
Yep.  
All I can do is comment with my own experiences.  Husband cheated, didn't tell me.  I found out a year later.  I'm more angry that he didn't tell me than the fact that he made on mistake.

**Club:** I moved Stoke down to League 1 and I've been rebuilding with British youngsters.  **Best player:** Aleksandar Mitrovic. Scored 26 goals to win the golden boot in league 1. Scored a hattrick in his first game!  **Best signing:** Andrew Robertson, LB. Bought him at 69 rated, already 73 and he has been upgraded to an Exciting Prospect. Absolutely rapid on the wing.  **Best player that was already at the club:** Bojan. He is great in tight spaces and has already grown to 80.  **Biggest Bargain:** Declan John, £1m. An exciting prospect!  **Player who has disappointed me:** Will Hughes for me as well... hasn't grown at all.  **Top Scorer:** Mitrovic  **Any youth players scouted?**   I have like 4 or 5 youth players that I got to Potential to be Special via the may growth jump. My scout future star has been disappointing, came into the team at 56 rated, but has grown literally every month so far so there's that!   **Silverware:** FA Cup / League 1 Trophy
That is terrible posture..

Nice clean looking landeron. What's the case size?
yes, yes he is.  I can guarantee if his kids ever find out it will be detrimental to them, especially at the young ages they are at, this alone makes him a shitbag.  if you honestly think this guy did nothing wrong, except not ask his wife for an open marriage, then your moral compass is really screwed up and you need to check yourself.  This dude's selfish choices are potentially/eventually going to really hurt a lot of innocent people in this situation and ruin a family (or two); and for what, to get his dick wet, this sounds like the decision making skills of a child not an adult/husband/father.  I don't know at this point if OP is the bigger shitbag or if its you for thinking the dude did nothing wrong.  I also laughed at how SHOCKED you were about people being "such hateful assmonglers" about OPs story; I mean for one it is a royal F up with the only real losers in this situation being the co-workers fiancé and OPs wife and kids, and two...this is reddit, do you live under a rock or something?
Kirby happened to be in the first few comics solely because I think he's funny. He's funny-lookin', funny-soundin', probably funny-smellin'. Once he starred in the first few, I decided to just stick with the guy. He's served me well over the years, I think.  All three books? I think getting them all in paperback is $80 through the Kickstarter. Free shipping if you're in the US!

You have to get all the expansions. They totally change the base game. But make sure you only get the expansion if you've played the base game less than five times. I mean, that's where it really shines.

This reminds me of a story from the development of the BattleChess game  &gt;It was well known that producers (a game industry position, roughly equivalent to PMs) had to make a change to everything that was done. The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.  &gt;The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the "actual" animation.  &gt;Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, "that looks great. Just one thing - get rid of the duck."  http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/

Not having day/night cycles is a real negative impact on immersion for me. I think it's particularly bad certain places, like Tatooine where one of the iconic shots of the entire series is Sunset on Tatooine.

It's mentioned in the description of the soul of the bed of chaos as well as in Quelana of Izalith's dialogue.  Soul: &gt;The Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate the First Flame from a soul, but instead created a distorted being of chaos and fire.  Quelana: &gt;My mother, the Witch of Izalith, was one of the primeval Lords… &gt;Her power came from the soul that she found near the First Flame. &gt;..She focused this power to light a flame of her own, but she failed to control it."
In this case they're practically the same kingdom. After the dwarves were driven from Moria they founded Erebor, with the same royal line and everything.

Dude I've work at Walmart for the last 14 years.
I like all of the above. I collect nail polish to the extreme, I adore fashionable clothing and spend hundreds on the shit while raving about sales with my friends (both sorority girls and geeks). But I also watch anime, I listen to weird fucking indie music (as well as Gaga and Beyonce), I play videogames from casual to hardcore genres, I play sports and I run, both because they're fun and because I want to be hot. I read excessively, from college textbooks to computer programming guides to YA romances and sci fi dystopias.   You cannot fucking judge a person from their surface interests because that's an extremely unimportant aspect of who the person is. 
Photoshop movie posters/iconic photos and replace the faces with your colleague's faces.  Did this often at a place I studied.   EDIT: Then of course, stick them where everyone can see.
If they printed that exact headline for 500 years, it would never end.   In 500 years they would still be pledging to write the same headline for the next 500 years.
He needs to use his meteors to clear the wave effectively so chances are when you get to the first mid camp respawn he won't have all 3 up to fight. Noxious fumes is used to combo the stun and path of flames shouldn't be used aggressively as you leave yourself without an escape. so really you walk into the fight with 1 or 2 meteors and flame wave. where as ,say Scylla, can just 1-2-4-receive kill and still have sentinel to escape.
I don't always watch the WS games, but I would make a point to watch as many as I could if this was the matchup.
Uh, it's not meant to be funny. It's actually a kind of depressing song about a hikikomori feeling shut off from the rest of the world and would rather live life as 'human baby' to not suffer everything that an adult has to go through and that everyone should do the same as not to be hurt by others. This is flawed in it self and only continues a cycle of a hikikomori. The whole song basically sums up 'Welcome to the NHK' and how the main character feels. The song is just done with a quirky sound. Example of the lyrics:  When humans are born naked everyone is loved the same Why then is it that during our lives Our fates are divided in a most cruel way  Some look people in the eyes, others are not seen, some know love, others don't If that's the case I would rather be a baby until I die - a baby human  "Oh what a cute baby! He makes me want to love him!" (All according to plan!) (That went great!)  The baby she hold is actually a baby human Behind that innocent face he is snickering inside You should be one too! It's nice and easy! Baby human Ababa ababa, dance, multiply, and then world domination! Conquer Russia, Canada, and India too  They don't do what I say, even though I'm the king, she doesn't look at me, even though I am her lover Why is reality like this? Do we even need truth?  I pretended to laugh it all away, but the day I was told that was impossible I decided I have no choice, but to be a baby until death - a baby human

You have so absolutely no idea of WoW that it hurts to read your bullshit.
All the manual blasters are still here. If you liked the Alpha Trooper you'll love the Elite Alpha Trooper. That aside there's Rampage, Retaliator, Hammershot, Roughcut, Slingfire etc etc.   Also, there's nothing "silly" about the flywheel blasters. They are popular for very good reasons - they are extraordinarily capable and reliable weapons for wars and HvZ after some electrical modding, and not half bad in stock form either.
there it goes!
Man, I would never have thought that the first reports of invasion in America would have come from listening to German radio broadcasts, but it makes absolute sense to keep D-Day a secret for as long as possible.   Fascinating.

I'm not certain, but I'm pretty sure it uses the same double din stereo as B5s.  In that case, I've heard of some guys who have done some electrical jerry-rigging to get an aux in there, but the easiest way would be to spend $100 on an aftermarket stereo and just chuck it in there.
From my understanding it used to be at the intersection of Yager and Lamar.  Now it is a temple across from a charter school.

This is such a overused and inaccurate argument.
I think the extent of Windows 10 opportunities for Xbox One will lie in the OS that handles the apps, the Kernel. This would allow for the develop for one platform, deploy on all devices approach they're wanting to go with along with a shared app store.  For the Xbox OS itself and how that translates into what will be done with the home screen, pins and the customisation in general, I think that's specific to the Xbox One at the moment. Even if it isn't, I don't see this drastically changing the Xbox One interface just because it doesn't make sense.  Background colours and images might be added, tiles may gain additional functionality for live tiles and resizing pins, all of which would be nice but this doesn't have anything to do with Windows 10. They could do this now and they are probably going to start (if they aren't already) working on some of these features to implement in a monthly update at some point.  There's lots of exciting potentials for Microsoft's approach to apps with Windows 10 along with it being a single OS that scales for the device it's on. That will allow MS to build up an ecosystem that may bring more users to more of their platforms. It will also likely solve the problem on all MS devices of there not being many apps to choose from.  This definitely does affect the Xbox One in some form though. I grabbed [this](http://i.gyazo.com/721afda093e998a3c57fcccc69b6d82f.png) screenshot of from their [video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=84NI5fjTfpQ#t=197) of when they showed the OneNote app for a second in their Windows 10 event today and that suggests we'll be hearing some news soon. Others have noticed this but I've yet to see a screenshot of it so I thought I'd do that.  I'm pretty excited to see what comes of all this but I'd keep my expectations tempered for how this applies to the Xbox One. There's no point setting ourselves up for disappointment.
With his symptoms, absolutely not. I think the dude just regained his ability to play golf.   He's still on LTIR and he's gonna be there for the rest of his contract. 
I can imagine people will often take your "Are you OK?" post-game replies as sarcastic, belittling and provocative, or are you not experiencing this? If I would've lost a game and would be tilting, I'm sure I would go into an even worse tilt if my opponent randomly messaged me if I'm ok.

Wasn't expecting much, but hot DAMN that was a nice compilation video. Kat was flat out MADE for these kinds of insane flashy plays. I'm going to post this everytime someone calls Kat a button mashing, no skill involved champ. "Oh, just jump in when they're low and press R to win".   That Zhonya's play against the Zed and the Kha'Zix was just beautiful. The only little complaint I have is, it would be nice if you showed the plays in regular speed first, and then played them in slow motion. Some of these plays happen so fast, it's hard to tell what's actually going on the first time watching it.

I think it also helps to put things into perspective; influenza contributes to or causes 45,000 deaths in a typical "flu season" in the US.  In the same time period, Ebola has caused roughly 6% of that...it's not an apples-to-apples scenario, but neither is Western medicine compared to Liberia and other West Africa nations.
Lol does it really feel that good to say 'Nigger' on the Internet? It must by how often you throw it around on this sub, posing as a libertarian (which you are not). Perhaps you should go out into the real world and tell people how you feel in person. Might be more rewarding than spamming the Internet with hate speech. ;D

I don't have a foolproof answer...that's why I was so psyched when I saw the sub...however the confrontational method doesn't sit well with me...seems like it is egging them on to act like dicks...and we know they rarely need an excuse...Even though I resent them, I kill them with kindness...im not saying I OFFER any info that isn't directly asked for...but if by telling him where im going makes the whole situation over faster, ill do it...if opening my window and flashing a smile defuses things when I know ive done nothing wrong im doing it...it intuitively feels better than starting off by opening my window a crack and announcing I will answer no questions unless Im being detained...So like I said I don't have all the answers, just stating my opinion...

I understand where you're coming from too. It's a team you want to compete year in year out, and they're, in a sense, wasting a 2nd/3rd rounder on a guy that hopefully never sees the field. After seeing the Packers/Bears go through it last year, even if Brady misses a half with a concussion and is back that next week, I'd rather be safer. Plus  happy Hoyer is in Cleveland. Hometown Boy is an awesome story.

&gt; She pretended to be someone that lived in areas that she did not live in. It doesn't matter if it occurred during registration or not, it was fraud and she was pretending to be someone she was not.  Yes. It was fraud. But she wasn't pretending to be someone else. Asking for ID would have shown that she was who she said she was.  &gt; However, I would imagine that a voter ID would have an address or voting district on it and could probably prevent people from either registering illegally or voting illegally in the manner she did.  No state has a voter ID of that sort. No state even has a voter ID. Driver's licenses or other forms of ID are used.  If you want to go with a state/national ID card, then great. Try proposing that, see how far you get. It's taboo in the US.

I respectfully disagree. If men and women were 100% equal, male disposability would only be an issue to the exact same extent that female disposability would be, and the same would apply to every other issue. I don't agree that "egalitarianism acknowledges both sides of the issue whereas feminism can have a very polarizing effect." I think the word "egalitarianism" is often just a cop-out or a way to avoid the negative stereotypes around the word "feminism".   I'm not trying to make it into a feminism vs. MRA thing at all. I'm trying to say gender quality is not a result that means women are better off than men, because by definition that wouldn't be equality. Feminism focuses on the female perspective because today, and even more so historically, women are the more disadvantaged sex overall, even if there are some areas where men suffer from sexism. The goal of feminism is still gender quality. It emphasizes women for historical and practical reasons, not because the goal is to replace a patriarchal system with a matriarchal one. 
Genitals are literally a binary. There's no spectrum; you have the parts of a biological female and/or the parts of a biological male (or nothing).

I'm starting to think the best way for non-marketers to learn marketing is to start marketing themselves. Start a blog, write a book, build a list, teach a class online... Start yourself, don't wait for a company to put you on.
Familiarize myself with every bit of UI there is, then jump into a custom game to try it out, goof around in each game for a while until I'm comfortable enough with the controls and everything, then play a multiplayer match starting from Halo 4, then one in Halo 3, then one in Halo 2 (hopefully I get classic, then anniversary), and finally one in Halo CE.  After I've gotten the feel of it all downpacked, I'll play matchmaking just like I normally would, and have fun forever and ever and ever, forever and forever ever... always.  I'll probably start the campaigns in order of 1-4 on the 2nd or 3rd day of owning the game... depending on how much free-time I can put into it.  Yeah, I've had this planned out for a while... ^^help ^^me

The reason people hold TB in such high regard is because he is a funny fat white heterossexual gamer who is brutally honest, and the majority of fat white heterossexual gamers relate to him.

Our hitting was historically bad this year. A gritty leader isn't going to change that. We just don't have the talent. I like Cashner a lot but our pitching is good now and has upside coming up from the farm. Our hitting is shitty and has very little upside coming from the farm.

Maybe they'll stop calling programs "apps" too
You may activate abilities so long as there are no restrictions and you can pay the costs. If the cost is to tap the creature, you can not pay the cost the turn it comes into play, and you can't pay the cost if it's already tapped.  The slightly more verbose way of saying "you may activate abilities multiple times a turn".
Try this: go to windowsphone.com, navigate to the app and select install.  WP8 or 8,1? Cyan?
u dumb
&gt; I don't believe it was worth it  It was a gamble. On the one hand is Ukraine joining EU and potentially become successful country thus making revolution in Russia possible. On the other is regaining control over Ukraine, raising nationalistic ideas in Russia and increasing power by "small victorious war".  Russia gambled and lost.
Any chance of an explanation or is that all we're going to get?

Got it, thank you very much.
which is why you see innocent people get hurt when they do something stupid at a traffic stop. cops see videos like this in training and deal with dangerous and belligerent people all the time, they are going to be on edge from the outset. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/25/south-carolina-police-officer-shooting-unnarmed-man-charged  Watch the video here. notice how he jumps out of the car right away? then dives back in for his license? yeah the similarities between the two are striking. obviously he shouldn't have started firing but when you look at the two side by side can you see why he might have?
Interesting stuff. Thanks!
Sorry to hear that. Being stuck on a sealed plane with someone with TB (likely many people) must really up your chances of contracting it. My exposure came from a drunk girl who had come down from a northern native reserve. She got into a fight with her sister at the movies and got beaten up. We had her in the back of the ambulance and she did as so many drunks do, she spit at me, and a bloody gob of spit landed IN MY MOUTH.  The nurses pulled me aside after I gave report at the ER, and told me that she was a known patient, and was already actively being treated for TB. I started treatment that day and began having chest x-Rays every three months. Luckily I am clear, I wouldn't be allowed to work if I had a communicable disease, not to mention the effects of the disease itself.

People are saying it is a bad normal summon and doesn't help progress anything. I think they are missing the point entirely. If you are running 1 copy, you aren't too likely to draw it. You play 3 unuk and 3 rota, you can dump him easily if you want to. It gives unuk a purpose after you have dumped Deneb. Then you just summon it off of Altair when you have run out of good Deneb targets, or if you can burn for game. It adds up pretty quickly. I have been running 1 since I started playing the deck and it has only been bad at MOST 5% of the time. Play it if you like it, don't if you don't.
I heard that you can repot Nyx Milk and any jumbo pencils by heating them up (while holding with tongs) and holding them over a little container. The product slides out all melted and hardens fast again. Maybe that would help.

It's pretty much any doorknob. When H1N1 was a big crisis, I was shocked that the advisories didn't include cleaning staff wiping all door knobs and touchable surfaces in buildings and in trains and planes... A disease like this can spread also at restaurants, where infected workers can easily contaminate food without anyone knowing until it's too late. I feel like the real measures to stop the disease from spreading will not really work out well in the long run. Luckily the rich will survive in their panic rooms.
I think it was a case of, we can do it the hard way, or we can do it the easy way, either way, you're gone Mr. Walker.
What is diverse about destiny to you? Honest question. It can't be the environments that are entirely the same every time you go through them, nor the constant horde missions you have to replay, nor the utterly pitiful and lacking story, nor the areas of the map you can't explore/invisible walls, nor that every class is nearly identicle in crucible (and even pvp) minus supers to a small extent, nor the exotics that aren't really exotic or unique at all, nor the exotics that eveyone now shares thanks to xur, nor the level 30s/29s who all share the same armor and to a similar but slightly less severe extent everyone above level 24. I could go on and on. Destiny is BY FAR one of the least diverse games I have ever played. The only thing I can think of might be the aesthetic environments.

Yes, it comes out (officially sold) on the following Monday.   The reason we got a Wednesday chapter release a few chapters back is due to that Monday being a holiday, so they shipped out earlier.
Zemaiah tapped on the scabbard of his straight-edged, European-like zanpakuto as he listened to Shinya talk about his decisions. Although he didn't get into further detail, and was rather vague like his former captain was on what exactly happened, Zemaiah had already decided beforehand that being on the fence about issues regarding the Gotei was not effective and that he would have to choose sides sooner or later.  He had already left Panda to her duties and reassured her that he didn't need any help. Now it was time to choose a path. He removed his face mask and gazed at Shinya with gleaming, emerald-green eyes seemingly piercing into Shinya's soul.  "You may recognize me; you may not, but I when I returned to Seireitei after dealing with issues in the World of the Living, I realized that I didn't belong anymore."  He kneeled onto the ground and bowed his head.  "Tsubasa-sama, please accept me as your pupil."
WOAH. Hippy, man..... *hippy*.

Yeah, that law sounds pretty much unconstitutional.  Hopefully it will be found to be so the first time it is invoked.  Wait.  I'm not sure the innocent until proven guilty thing is a constitutional thing.  It might just be our legal tradition.  I hope it's a constitutional thing.

Understand that you shouldn't immediately dismiss a black person as a potential partner simply because you don't like the way they look because theres a huge amount of diversity within ethnicities and you might even find a black person you like on a personal level and you shouldn't dismiss them because you don't find black people attractive.  Overall Don't feel bad about it, we can't really help our preferences. I don't find South Indian women attractive on average, but that doesn't mean I'll never date a South Indian.

Maybe, but things are expensive enough without adding delivery. Besides, the walk and the wait are a nice break.
BTW (just started watching so I don't know if this is mentioned in the episode) the Octium 4 chip (besides the name being a play on the Pentium 4, released late 2000) is probably based on a real chip released by the NSA called the [Clipper chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip). Basically if a telecom company used these chips, every key they generated and programmed into a chip for use by a customer had to be handed over to the government. Then:  &gt; If government agencies "established their authority" to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone.  So the NSA has free access to all the keys, and in all likelihood the NSA, not the courts, would be the one who decided whether an agency's request was adequately "established". The chip turned out to be shitty encryption-wise, but the NSA still tried to force it on telecom companies until there was a huge backlash and the chip was scrapped. It did encourage people to make strong open source encryption packages, like PGP, available to render the clipper chip obsolete before it ever saw any use.  Of course the NSA managed to attain their goal of freely spying on US citizens regardless, but it did set them back several years.

I'd think that at 12,000lbs the 4bt would not be optimal. The 6bt is a near bolt in swap from what I've read. Some relocation of transmission mounts and maybe and adjustment to the doghouse area, but the motor mounts are in the same location as the original and can use the same brackets.   From what I've read the hardest pars are pushing the radiator forward an inch or so and routing the turbo intercooler piping. 
The page file will grow as big as it can, but will stay at minimum size if there isn't enough space available. It will just start swapping files in and out quicker ... thereby slightly affecting performance. The only caveat on this is to leave enough space to accommodate the minimum page file size.

I've received several hate mail because of knowing how to push people's buttons. Several of them were from people I trolled on purpose with a lightning mage. They ranged from "get gud kid" (when they're at least ten years younger than me) to "ScRuB ;-)" when I was dominating them by at least 15/1 ratio. These were actually before I had a clan tag. "F--king mother hacker" was probably the best one when he lagged horribly.
I disagree.   1. Punching. A punch can stop a fight. A punch can block. A punch can disable your attacker's arm. It can disrupt your opponent's mind. It can do all of these separately, or it can do them at the same time.   2.  Everything else.   Although I'd put any skill that avoids or de-escalates above punching. 
Good riddance. Original is shit.

it varies wildly from episode to episode. It has average animation for the most part. Sometimes for important episodes or important fights like the ones from the links above, they hire a special animation crew. Those episodes generally stand out. Filler is always nonsense and they spend the minimal possible amount on it.

Uhh.. nobody is disputing the fact that the star and crescent isn't Islamic in origin. It's a Turkic symbol. The only reason it's associated with Islam is because of the Ottoman Empire's status as the most recent caliphate for nearly half a millennium and many former Ottoman states adopting the star and crescent.
In college I did security at concerts. I loved it. It wasn't just standing around listening to music for free but it definitely didn't turn me off to going to concerts. The perks were amazing (like working back stage, or getting your friends great seats or the drunk women who love guys in uniform lol).  I would imagine being a grunt at Oracle Arena would be a similar experience for a Warriors fan. Don't see why it would ruin the appeal.

I once had a technical director refuse to take my calls as director during a basketball game because he didn't like the shots that I wanted to use, even though I was doing what made the most sense on things like free throws, getting a nice top of the tee slight to the side full shot centered on the shooter, transitioning to either some form of straight on backboard shot or upwards from below the hoop in some form.  Nothing crazy, always with the ball clearly in frame.  Don't want to push the buttons I want you to push? Stop being TD and get out.  As much fun as having greater control is, being the control freak I am and we can all be, I always found it most fun to do the crows nest camera for football games.  Nobody else seemed capable of actually keeping the ball in frame on long passes, I don't understand how hard it is to operate a camera on a tripod, we were using really nice ones.

I feel way more proud about writing a paper that I know was objectively good than I do about graduating from a college which judged me inaccurately based on criteria that are not ones I care about.

They're *my* feelings, and besides, it's not like I control them directly anyway.

The frame where Korra is jumping out of the car is not before she cuts her hair, it is after. Also, Jinora is a master airbender and can look after her siblings, who both happen to be very competent air benders themselves. They are certainly a better fighting team than Opal and Kai. Tenzin ain't slacking; if Jinora is dispatched it is probably for something really important that Tenzin won't trust anyone else to do (If Tenzin, Mako, and Asami are busy and Bolin isn't around. Also other peeps like Zuko, Tonraq, Suyin, and Lin are also probably busy). Theoretically, [since episode four is called "The calling", it is possible that the swamp somehow calls Jinora and Korra there for some higher purpose.](/spoiler).

The thing is, out non conference could be much better but Brandon refused to play any of them away. Oregon wanted to set up a 4 game series with us playing 2 home and 2 away. Great right? Everyone wins? Nope Brandon said we'd be glad to play them but they had to come to the big house for all the games. And that wasn't an isolated incident
There are dozens of us! DOZENS!

I've played for only a few matches and already it's a massive improvment. I'm 400+ hours into the game and I'm extremely happy with the upgrades to it.
Who could possibly say no to that?!

i was looking for a replacement for my factory top. i found this one cheap on craigslist ($75, which is crazy cheap for an lj top) so i'm giving it a go. it keeps my stuff and a dog from bouncing out, but mostly i just kinda liked the look.  That being said, i'm taking this top off soon. it increases the blind spot behind the driver with the black panel (dunno why they didnt make it out of cargo up to there), and its about to be winter where i'm giving the factory top its last go. come next summer i'll replace it with a frameless rampage or the like and be done for a while.

Yeah, the almost complete lack of combos (outside of the triple-tap move) was annoying. And they could probably put in a virtual thumbstick to accommodate for fireballs &amp; such, even if it's locked from moving the character.
If you can make it a job. What about the thousands of kids that play it all through their school and college years? Still the majority of the risk with none or little of the reward.

What about the habitat itself? For a trip to the moon you can get away with just cramming everyone in a tiny capsule for 3 days, but people tend to go insane when you send them on a multi year trip with no leg room. Even without any radiation shielding that's gonna be heavy. A BA330 is about the lightest thing I can think of per volume at around 20 tons for 330 m^3. 20 tons is a hell of a lot of mass
Do you mean White Wonderland? Nocturnal just happened a month ago.  And I have heard terrible things about POPNYE. Especially how they handle traffic going in and out of the floor level.  
Awesome that was a quick response, sure il get back to you in 3 hours.

For what it's worth, I think the life begins at conception, but personhood, the obtaining of a soul, may occur with the first signs of the pineal at 49 days of fetal life. Of course, this is all massively speculative, but that's how I envision the process. I think the soul is immaterial but it affects us and is felt through physical-chemical processes. I think people can have souls who are born without pineal glands, so clearly there's more work to be done. Is the pineal necessary? Probably not. Something else may take its place in its absence.
I'm planning to do this. Eagles offense is a mess at the moment.

For boys I tend to like classical names. Examples: Henry, Francis, Walter, Charles.  Girl names that are feminine.  Middle name spot I like family names to honor loved ones or another meaningful name.   Not a fan of unisex names, unique/incorrect spelling, or super trendy.
Yo have no idea how many guys like you we deal with, even worse for guys like Dean who've got so many people excited for the product. Just cool off, write some constructive bug reports and if you cant manage that, come back in 3-6 months.
Doug Martin is kind of an unknown at the moment. He had an OK week last week, but can he sustain it? Matt Ryan &amp; Shane Vereen for Manning is good, andre johnson for doug martin is bad. No matter how you slice it I don't like the deal for you **unless** both Johnson and vereen are riding your bench.

I was stuck by Liverpool fans...but here's the catch- this was inside of the "manchester city supporters section". We paid $100 per ticket instead of $35 to be sat inside of what was called the manchester city supporters section. We called the company after asking if they know what a "supporters section" means but they said "this is america, not Europe. We can't control who sits where" and the stadium was maybe 50 to 1 in favor of Liverpool fans literally dead serious. With that ratio I wasn't surprised at all the city supporters section was filled 75% with Liverpool fans. Bottom line is Americans fuck just about everything they possibly can up dealing with the sport I've always loved. My friend has been to a handful of mls games and last year went to London and saw a game at craven cottage and said it blew everything he's over seen in America out of the water, and that's just craven cottage. I can only imagine the etihad

Another great vid from Stony. Can anyone fill me in on what he's been up too? He seems to have gone AWOL, even from his og stuff. 
Great work I love Odin. My Instagram icon is not being themed for some reason does anyone know how I can fix this?
I imagine its more of sex drives changing over time. It happens. I definitely agree about doing what it takes to keep things together for the kids, except if arguing becomes a regular thing, and the kids know about it, especially if there's regular yelling. Obviously, professional help is the first step, though. 
Go pistols. I LOVE TKA and always have one for just running missions to grind for cash but you're limited on types of damage. You can only do Kinetic.   If something has 100% resistance to Kinetic (like A Janta Rockshaper) you can't do any damage. Or other high end stuff has higher resistance to Kinetic.   With pistols you have energy and you can get an Acid pistol. Being able to switch types of damage is useful. 
I'll play. Level 26 Titan play both classes no mic but good at team work
Kittball Records been coming out with some good shit recently.
Wow. Here is a poster they did for a TV show, [Deadbeat](http://bravodesigninc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/hulu_Deadbeat_vertical_V1.jpg). They love to piece shitty isolations of actors and force them all into the same scene. There is zero consideration of the lighting from each photo, and no attempt at color correction to make them fit together.
It can work the other way too. Homerism is heavily biased towards recent results.
I think the person who hurt her threw it out the window to get rid of it quickly.  Then a pedestrian walking by noticed it crumpled on the ground, and thinking someone dropped it accidentally, they picked it up and spread it over the bush so it could be spotted easily.

Everything that needs to be said has already been said. Don't forget that this doesn't define you as a person, nor does it make you any less of one. You should be really proud of yourself for taking the first steps towards helping yourself. Good job and best of luck OP!

I entirely agree.
Alright, updated version. I did this really quickly.  1. What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class at Iowa State University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret houseparties on fraternity row, and I have over 300 confirmed tailgates. I am trained extensively in barbeque and I make the best barbeque in the entire US. Your school is nothing to me but just another community college. Our team will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of referees across the USA and your team is getting blacklisted so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your chance at a bowl. Your team is fucking screwed, kid. Our offense can be anywhere, anytime, and can score in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with the read option. Not only are they extensively trained in read option, but they have access to the entire arsenal of bubble screens and I will use it to them to their full extent to wipe your miserable team off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Your team is gonna Clemson hard, kiddo.
For one, he sounds like either a shitty teacher or a shitty person or both, and anyone who sees this video will see that. US doesn't need very many people to teach English as a second language, and he doesn't seem to know very much about English, so he probably wouldn't make a very good English instructor.

Basic story is, these two guys have been best friends since the first grade. They went on to start a business together (making commercials), make their own award winning documentary, and start Youtube. They're pretty good, and I watch Good Mythical Morning (their talkshow) every single day before I go to work. They also seem like generally nice people.

[](/wmapth-i)Yeah, the one thing that's really bothering me are the upvote/downvote icons. If they're going to put the effort into changing the icons, they should at least change the upvote/downvote/neutral flairs to match.

I hear good things about TrollXChromsomes
Yea that's another way to look at it as well. It just feels like I'm not getting the same thrill for winning as I did on other generic FPS's. 
While I agree, unfortunately the mindset that they are 'other' and deserve hell drives too many people away from compassion towards violence and malice.

I was not sure about this since it has a amazing  price and i really need to replace my rubber dome keyboard as letters are wearing off not a big deal since i am pretty much a touch typist and the little risers on the bottom both broke off.
Yeah, there is zero reason for that horn to be in Winterfel, and even less reason to blow it if you find it there.
Why would I want to spend time in hospital just to get stronger medication? That is not what I'm looking for.  Edit: And I have been to hospital, some nights my legs are in so much pain I can't sleep or walk. Tramadol was what I was given.

Within the last ten years, but largely since Obama, the old style of both sides of the aisle compromise disappeared and only a handful of senators carried on that tradition of compromise in order to do the people's business. Olympia Snowe was the last of that breed on the Republican side, for the most part, and too a certain extent, Susan Collins followed that same tradition....but only to a certain extent. For example, she voted twice to shut down our government, kow-towing to the Tea Party extremists. Many see her now as having sold out. Others are less informed. She still does not appear to have completely gone over to the Tea Party side of the force, but she's no Olympia Snowe, that's for sure. Some people are overly loyal to her, mostly out of the sentimental tradition of Snowe and Margaret Chase Smith they imagine she carries on.

You know what I don't get?  Why a company with so many pretty good iOS apps doesn't have any that directly connect to their flagship software. Why can't I use figure as a controller?   Why can't I convert figure riffs into rns files.  It's a huge missed opportunity 
I've seen at least one, and I know who it is, but I can't think of the name. Usually hung out by /r/science.
Yeah, but with the ability to get away with it for so many years comes arrogance. Its almost like Bill was like "hmmmm, I wonder how shitty of a team I can win a SB with!", and he set out to build a shittier team each year as a challenge.

I have no idea what the laws are like in Australia, I just did some quick googling and found that sport shooting and hunting were common reasons that people got permits. Just don't be afraid of pursuing the permitting process, if you're a law-abiding citizen with no criminal history you should easily qualify.
Being chased. It originated when I was a child and my mom used to chase me up the stairs to get me to go to my bedroom to sleep. She did it in a kindhearted way and obviously never meant to cause me any real harm but damn did it stick with me. 
Yeah and not going is for the Lazy.
Sweet Mango Relish would be a good name for an old-timey bluesman.
This is honestly a question only you can answer. You need to realistically ask yourself if you think you have what it takes to turn this into a living. If you truly feel you're talented enough and just need the time to make a name for yourself, go for it. But a college education won't hurt you (unless it puts you in debt, of course). I've been in your spot, but I'm fortunate enough to have a mom who will bust her ass to put me through college so I don't end up in debt. And I'm not gonna waste the opportunity for a free education.   I have told myself and others on multiple occasions that if I had to pay for my own college, I probably would have dropped out and just focused on music a few years ago.   But this question is a super grey area thing. Some people have dropped out of college and been extremely successful in music and some people have college degrees and have been extremely successful in music. The opposite is also true (i.e. an utter lack of success).   So really, you just have to ask yourself if you think it'd be worth it. I'm finishing up my last year and I can't wait to be done so I can just completely focus on music. But I'm still glad I went to college, if not for anything more than the experience.

Look I don't think ON players (besides boze) will do any livestream marathon, would be cool but I doubt. What i'm saying if they're doing a Ghost/BO2-AW livestream then it would cool to see Killa doing it. Killa would be playing 8s and wagers all stream long, there wouldn't be any strats in the first day. It would pros playing pubs, league play and 8s and getting use to feel of the game

yea it was a big cock tease throughout most of it and they have a lot of plot holes with the whole "Evil Alien Rabbit God that created chakra". But the last 12-15^idfk chapters really pushed forward. But it made a lot more questions than answers which is terrible writing. Hopefully the final Naruto Movie would further explain the whole "Evil Alien Rabbit God" with at least a back story what was the purpose of having a zombie army.
I was thinking more along the lines of /r/behindthegifs
Even and odd harmonics are a function of the distortion percent.   Current demand is not really very high for any of these home speakers at normal listening levels. A sign of this is the little $50 class-d powered the 86dB speakers to full testing volume(I had to wear ear plugs) without issue running off of a wall wart.  Transient response would have shown up as frequency issues - if the drivers were hanging more or less there would be additional energy.
Haha, thanks for the input.  I am basing my purchasing decision purely upon your articulate review.

He definitely should've won that game, he wrecked himself playing *way* too safe and trading way too hard instead of just slamming face when he had an impossibly huge board.  And then Thijs got an insane Thoughtsteal &gt; Hex a couple turns later.

I dunno, I agree with Belated Media - [Yoda never should have picked up a lightsaber to begin with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAbug3AhYmw#t=2m47s). I know it's unpopular to clash with the canon of EU, but it's the goddamn truth.
Its not like motels are made for married males cheat their wives. I think majority of population had sex in motels at least once in their lives, specially early couples that still don't feel comfortable to take the new SO home too soon (as most part of population lives with parents until marriage). Anyways, abortion illegality has more to do with the influence of religion in politics than anything.

One of the first books I ever read was The Andromeda Strain, I highly recommend it. I was 13 and that book got me interested in biomedical research and the scary world of serious extraterrestrial diseases. Thanks Michael Crichton.
Well, to me personally, trp is about the sexual marketplace and women are not special snowflake. It's about unplugging from the disney fantasy most guys grow up with like true love and all that shits.  I honestly couldnt give a rat ass about men rights movement and all that crap. I downvote most of those thread actually because it's not relevant to me.

I genuinely do too. When an actor takes a movie and reads the script, they have no idea how it's going to look or sound or be promoted. The best they can do is study up on the director, but all too often you see an actor who might have potential, ending up in a shitty movie, and wonder how they felt when they first found out they just wasted all that time, and how it might affect their career.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but I thought Washington state has it on the lawbooks that if you are a waitress or server (essentially a tipped job) you have to be paid the Washington state minimum wage IN ADDITION to tips. So someone being a waiter would make min + tips. Other states have it at the federal level, which allows employers to pay a couple bucks at most. Is that wrong for Washington state?

Indeed; especially since Underbarrel Flamethrowers, Underbarrel Monofilament Combat Chainsaws (**PROFESSIONAL AS ALL FRAAAAAAG**) and Underbarrel Bola Launchers are apparently pretty common.

Dolphins are probably much more dangerous than sharks. Not because they are more likely to attack you, but because if they do they'll fuck around with you and kill you slowly just for fun.
Maybe it's the other way around: they see the world from a childish perspective, unable to grasp its always shifting nature.
I'll give it a try. Thanks!

It's a special scanner by [Matterport](http://matterport.com/). There's a good post about it over at the [Photography for Real Estate blog](http://photographyforrealestate.net/2014/09/23/is-matterport-an-important-tool-for-real-estate-photography/).  I don't think it's caught on because it's expensive! You need a $4500 scanner and Matterport is the only one that can turn the results into a tour. That tour service costs from $99/mo to $199/mo.
as a guy who went thru that with a spouse that withheld on me.. this is going to backfire on you.   the longer you hold out, the sooner he is going to start resenting you.  and when that shit happens that opens the doors for him to get some strange from somewhere else.  just break up with him and roll the fuck on.  if you don't care about the relationship just pack up and get on.

Or treatment from the Architect. Or exposure to Old God Radiation from killing the Archdemon, or some other kind of link to Urthemiel.  The question is whether the devs want to go there or not.
I think /u/sourbeer51 is addressing the safety of riding bikes on campus.  Mission St. might be the busiest street on campus but nobody would be driving fast if the bike lanes were full.  I think the pizza delivery would be a good barometer of safety for the bike lanes.  People delivering pizza on bikes would familiarize the car drivers with people using those lanes.  The car drivers would learn to use caution around all the bike lanes.

I've always thought that a pony car was a small block that was made just to look good. Kind of like a modern v6 Mustang, Camaro, or Challenger. I don't think any of the v8 versions are pony cars.

Mono R Storm - Modern  T1: Hand is Manamorphose, Manamorphose, Simian Spirit Guide, Simian Spirit Guide, Locket of Yesterday, Mountain, Gitaxian Probe  Play mountain, tap, play Locket. Exile both Guides, Manamorphose adding RR, drawing Reforge the Soul. Repeat, adding RR. Locket means the 2nd Manamorphose was cheaper, so your mana pool is now RRR. Draw Grapeshot off of the 2nd Manamorphose. Storm = 3.  Cycle Probe for 2 life. Draw another Manamorphose. Storm = 4  Cast the 3rd Manamorphose for RR, with RRRR in mana pool. Storm = 5. Draw a Past in Flames. Miracle Reforge the Soul, drawing 7 (lets say 2 Pyretic Ritual, 1 Desperate Ritual, 1 Faithless Looting, 2 Mountain and another Probe), discarding Past in Flames and Grapeshot. Storm = 6.  Cycle the probe into another Desperate Ritual. Cast Desperate Ritual Spliced. Mana pool is now 6x R. Cast 2nd desperate for R. Mana pool now 8R. Cast both Pyretic Rituals, first costing 1 and R the second just R. Mana pool is now 11R. Storm Count is 11.   Flashback Past in Flames, cast your Manamorphose s again (3 total, Storm = 14). Do the same with all 4 rituals (storm = 19). Then, Grapeshot for 20 damage.

Someone stole my copy in high school and I've never forgiven them. Joke's on them though, because I'm in charge of the high school reunion and there will be blood.
Right. The person I originally replied to was saying that in Ohio the work was outsourced to the lowest bidder and that that's not the case in Michigan because the people pay taxes.  All that's irrelevant because the funding is the same regardless. So there's variation is how they're run, because that's handled locally, but it has nothing to do with their funding.
If all else fails, it's a US copy and I would be willing to sell.
alright
The art is really on point.
Thanks for your input! I think I'll go to 3 dictates. You're also probably right about Sorin, so I'll try testing with him more. Another big problem with this deck is that it loses steam after turn 4-5. Can you think of any good card advantage engines this deck could use? 
You'd be a pretty average real world gambler. Gambling is inherently in the house's favor, so everyone looses more often than they win.

I'm focusing on building a nice social circle right now. I just try to talk to whomever I want to become friends with in all my classes. I just literally approach them and say things like "How's your day going?" or "What's up?" and jut start from there.  Keep in mind that you're not going to build up a massive social circle in a couple of weeks. It takes months and months of talking at school *and* hanging out outside of school. Hanging out outside of school is really important because it's like the next level of a friendship. 
And you can't teach that!

You can't really avoid the system, the whole game is build on it.

Honestly there really isn't one, it's an idea we came up with as a band out our initial ep cover featured a bulls skull with 4 horns and I just extended on it, - black river here in townsville is famous for its rodeos so we just thought we would carry on the tradition, and because we are all metal heads I thought I would just make it "more metal" but also paying homage to the cover of black Sabbaths, self titled album,  granted the figure in black isn't pointing, but the idea was to say "you're next". Haha I hope this is at least something of a back story :)

They would still be able to play that type of land. This is because Godsend specifically says "cast" but lands are not cast, they are put into play as a special action that doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.   &gt; 115.2. There are seven special actions:   115.2a Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during each of his or her turns. A player can take this action any time he or she has priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of his or her turn.  So while older cards said "play" for everything, nowadays the correct term is "cast" for spells and "play" for lands. You never cast lands, thus you can play lands around Godsend's ability because you're not casting them, since it's just stopping you from "casting" them.
Yeah, the man spreaking German really belches it out, I'm sure it would sound at least better if he said them nicely. 
10 (septenary) = 7 (decimal). Coincidence?
The fact that it wasn't even in tune tells me that it probably wasn't being included in the actual mix going to the audience at a high enough volume to be heard over the other instruments. They probably went to the trouble of actually plugging it in and keeping it in the mix at low volume just so that they wouldn't risk a Milli Vanilli moment where if for some reason there was a point where she played through a rest or otherwise was "playing" guitar and no sound was coming out it would be blatantly obvious that she wasn't plugged in.

Well I am appalled at how bad that referee was. Neither of our players should have been sent off. Mildenhall won the ball and Clarke's first yellow was absolute bull shit.   Ollie Clarke's goal was magnificent.   Found it embarrassing that Eastleigh were time wasting while drawing at home against 10 men (only had 9 for the last 30 seconds or so). Hard fought point which I would have taken pre-match but am delighted with considering the (two) sending offs. 
Ok thanks :)

In the event of bad weather, I always have my weather radio on and leashes at the ready in case we have to get out. I also make sure I have plenty of my meds and gas in my car during that season, just in case. I have a hardhat too, but that makes people think I am crazy.

There are bees in Extra Bees/Binnie's mods which can produce Uranium (which by default can be used in place of yellorium)  The MFR laser can produce yellorium off of the power created by the reactor - probably not enough to be totally self sustaining though  You can use the cyanite re-processor to produce blutonium from your cyanite waste at 2 waste to one ingot. Blutonium also produces cyanite waste, so if you reprocess whenever possible, you essentially double the life of a single yellorium ingot.
I have do ask.  Do you even play guitar?  Muscle memory doesn't just mean you flip a switch in your brain and your muscles start going through the motions of a song.  Your muscle's "memories" are triggered by what you hear on a second-to-second basis.  All of these motions have to be adjusted on the fly by your brain, something that takes feedback from hearing yourself.  On top of this, playing to live music 100% means you need to hear yourself as a live band rarely plays in perfect time. All this aside, you really are just hating on her.  Defending Courtney Love is the last thing I thought I would be doing in this thread, but it's so obvious that she is putting on a show in this video and not even attempting to play.  She knows no one can hear her, makes no attempts to sound good, and people like you are trying to use this as an example of her ineptitude. If I was a successful musician that had played the same song thousands of times I would probably get drunk and perform on stage like this in my forties too.  
Corvair's are cool cars. Don't listen to people badmouthing their handling characteristics, especially the '65-'69's. The reason so many early examples crashed had more to do with the fact that Americans didn't have a friggin clue how to drive a rear-engined car (keep in mind that Beetle's and Porsche's were still were fairly uncommon in the early 60's). It's a *completely* different driving experience. Besides, by the time Nader's [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed) came out, the rear suspension had already been updated to be a bit friendlier to the average US consumer, but the damage had been done, reputation wise... In any case, the real problem with Corvair's are finding parts and then having to empty your wallet to pay for them.   If you're into mid 60's Chevy styling, you could always go with a '62-'74 [Nova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevy_II_/_Nova). There's a *huge* aftermarket, prices are affordable, they're easy to work on and the cars themselves can be had fairly reasonably if you look hard enough. Especially if you don't mind a 4-door ;) Good luck and let us know what you get!

SF and Oakland were mostly homeless encampments that did drugs all day and shit everywhere, it was insanity.   edit: http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-Occupy-camp-now-a-homeless-haven-3884645.php
These are the terms and definitions usually associated with them for the steps in the process.  The pre-approval is the document you need to get a letter sufficient to make offers.  Pre-Qualification: A verbal discussion that allows the lender to determine what they think you qualify for based on numbers shared on the phone or through email, with out documentation backing up the information.  Pre-Approval: Requires an application, credit report, income/asset documentation.  Loan is run through automated underwriting (AUS, LP, DU).  Now you begin shopping and look for a property.  Conditional / credit approval: AFTER the contract is ratified and the underwriter reviews the full file with the contract.  This is initial approval, with varying conditions that are required prior to...  Clear to close: All documentation is in that didn't arrive by the time the loan was conditionally approved, and the lender is ready to fund your loan.

Which model though? Some are far worse than others.
Just did my 10 times today. I will do another 10 tomorrow and every day after that until it ends.
What's that? 
And alcohol is the legal drug.
You've come face-to-face with an Omnipotent Internet Organism.  It knows all posts, and all post origins.  All original content is filtered down through it; it sees, knows, and has experienced all.  Your attempts at Internet have been collected into it's galactic maw, and a Big Crunch is imminent.

I'm sure that naturally, Annie will absolute wreck everyone else, but I'll do what I can for my favorite [Manga Spoilers](/m "split-personality mass murderer.") 
why are not all police documents on public searchable data bases? FOIA requests seem so pre-internet. 
Nope. Dont see it. :(

Well this is tremendously inconvenient. There's no way I can make it to a T-Mobile store in the foreseeable future. Seeing as I was trying to create a family plan, if I just had say, my brother create the account with his information and transferred my number, would that circumvent the issue?
You make a most apt comparison there. Have an upvote!
I have no idea, I was AFK for a lengthy period of time and I bet someone was not too happy about that. I didn't even notice it until I watched the video on youtube hahaha :D
I'm not sure what safari I have, but if you send me a friend request it may be what you are looking for.

That sort of thinking is shit flawed man.   It's like saying "oh it's easy to lose weight, just upreg your metabolism and run a temp of 101 for a few days.  The fat will melt away. "  You can't do that, because your body regulates metabolism and temperature.   But for a lot of people who can't lose weight, their body's "nutrition" thermostat is defective for some reason.  Yes, they're eating too much.  But if it were really as simple as "eat less", they wouldn't be fat.  The issue is their body is telling them to eat more than they need.  (which is where your thermodynamics comes into play).  When your body wants food and you're around food, it's really really hard to resist. But the goal is to reset that thermostat in order to then lose weight.   
Add me plz I need floette.
What a nice little bum. 
This can look pretty baller when done right, but I'd actually call this pretty advanced, and I think it gives off more of a mafia look than business.
