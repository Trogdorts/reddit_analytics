She can't make you tell her anything. You don't owe her anything. Tell her to mind her own business.
Nope never heard of it!
Why would he do this? It feels like a better ending when he lets himself die, maybe he suddenly realises this is a dream, perhaps this is why it's important to make it through the entire game without dying until that point. Simulation mode.
I've tried both of those already. And I've tried reinstalling the drivers to the audio and those were fine as well

I actually love the Blues driver and don't think I can get rid of it hahahaah. It's like my favorite pedal. But I am going to get the tube screamer as well. Thanks so much for your help man. My new years resolution is to build up my pedal board! But i'm actually considering buying a guitar synthesizer after a nice amp since I'm heavily into noise rock. 
Far Cry 4. It was a re-skinned Far Cry 3, but with a less intriguing story. 
thanks for the breakdown 
I recommend playing the games in release order not because of the story but because of gameplay mechanics.   It'll be pretty jarring to go from solid 5 to solid 1. In terms of story it might be best to start with the worst story.   It can only get better with each game played if done that way.
That's an interesting reaction, I use it daily without any issues. I don't give it a wait time though, maybe that's the difference?
Only way I'd like chip here is if we bring in shwartz to coach the defense cause chip sure as hell won't.

Okay, so (as you can tell from my posts elsewhere in this thread) I am very vocally **pro**-vaccine. Viruses and other pathogens are as big of an existential threat to humanity as you can get. On a population level, we *must* vaccinate if we want to have a snowball's chance in hell of having a healthy(ish) society that cares about and protects its most vulnerable members.  **HOWEVER** - at the individual (rather than population) level, unless you happen to be in an area with a currently-ongoing outbreak of the specific diseases for which we vaccinate, the *realistic* difference is going to be somewhere around zero. Not exactly zero, but not very non-zero.  Now - I personally would go with Pediatrician A, not only (and not even so much) as because of personal safety or philosophic reasons, but because of what each respective pediatrician is *signaling*. I personally prefer someone who takes a hard line based on contemporary medical research over someone who is willing to waffle because of Internet-inspired pearl-clutching. I don't argue with my accountant and I don't argue with my lawyer and I don't argue with my plumber - because if I thought I knew better then them, I wouldn't be bloody-well wasting my money on them. Same thing with doctors - I do my research, I can read Wikipedia and various online twaddle as well as anyone, but at the end of the day I don't have an MD. And I am *just* educated enough to know that I am *waaaay* out of my depth on medicine, just as I am with law and plumbing.
Haha. I still check my burner account for email from her. I had Hangouts notifications set to use special settings just for her and I glance at my phone constantly in the hopes of seeing that notification. Cray cray! lol  I still miss her like a mother fucker three weeks post NC. No regrets though. It was intense and I loved loving her.   Anyway, while I'm still mildly insane about losing her it has improved slightly and I know over time it'll get better. Hang in there! 
Did anyone else read this first as  "If Blake Bortles throws this many yards on Sunday then he'll have thrown for more yards this season than Blake Bortles threw for his entire Jaguars career."  I was like.... "No shit. He did better this season."  Then I reread it and felt dumb.

Wow, I'm not a fan of that. While I respect the value of portraying college as a 'youthful' competition environment, I don't think it's fair to discriminate against participants who may have been unable to attend college during their young adult age.  Regarding your four year in five proposal, did the surveys the board talked about sending out ever turn up a response? What do you think about the board sending out surveys to discuss the revised college eligibility rule proposal?  What is the process for submitting a proposal to the board of directors? Can USAU members submit proposals? Or do we need a member of the board to sponsor the proposal? I imagine it would carry more weight with the latter, but I don't know if that's required.

I said this somewhere else in the threat but Vasquez's works were always became the poster child for the type of people he'd make fun of.  It started with Johnny The Homicidal Maniac which made fun of the goth subculture and eventually the fanboys it got.  Zim is doing the same by having the new comics open with a recap done by a character meant to mock Zim fans.

You are so helpful!! Thank you so much, sooo this is probably stupid but I truly have no idea what I am doing... do I just mix the apple slices in with the sauerkraut? or do I saute it with the onions? And should I grill the kielbasa a little bit before I throw it in with everything else? If you're in pittsburgh, feel free to come over for dinner!!
Those are eggs or..?
I took Golf and it was absolutely amazing. It's not much of a accede mix course but it got me outside and exercising and in the sun. I learned a relatively simple sport that I can do with my Dad and my older brother. The teacher was awesome and a super laid back guy, would cancel class for rain but would still be there at the range if we wanted to hit some balls or practice form. It was an overall amazing experience 
Seriously, this guy is MVP
He shrugged, and smiled.   "Not enough alcohol."
I really don't understand how coaches allot minutes anymore. Bjelica has gotten 12 minutes while dieng has 9. Dieng has averaged 12 minutes/half as a freaking reserve. One would think he could get some solid run as a starter but whatever.

Yeah, its fun. Its actually called 'The Great British Bake-off' when it screens in the UK, and has been insanely popular (there's lots of Brits scrambling to explore baking now).  Paul Hollywood is a master baker, and created a series on bread baking which is well worth a watch too.  Its not as entertaining, but very informative if you fancy trying your hand at bread.
&gt;Sadly, however, when I use it, I get a short two paragraph post that I started last night and then abandoned, after deciding I didn't want to post about that after all.  That's probably the one about TWOW.  Edit: GRRM debunked this. Thank the Seven!
yea, that's why I dislike "art" it's subjective. you call that art? can you call my gum on the shoe art, also, drawing is losing it's grip now since everything can be done electronically, what do you think about that?  there's a lot of people who won't leave a mark on this world but guess what, each and every one of us will leave a carbon footprint and that's enough

Pretty much what /u/Alithnul said. You don't need any cards or bank account. All you need is a paypal account. Only downside to it is the paypal money stays on paypal I'm pretty sure, unless you order one of those paypal cards. So you aren't going to be able to spend any money in person, only online.

Yep, and then they let a geriatric with a pistol kill them with ridiculous no aim shots and continually missed a deserter not behind any cover while he killed them with no look behind the back shots.

I wouldn't be surprised if most of the problems CA has run into have all been Segas fault. The Rome II launch disaster was most likely Sega telling them to release despite it not being ready and CA doing it or else they wouldn't be able to continue. When people get pissed at CA they need to realize that they just make the game, most of the major decisions are made by shitty Sega.

The real question is why can't people talk about whatever they want to talk about without someone trying to censor them? Society has become too interested in removing people's right to share ideas about whatever it is they want to share ideas about if it doesn't suit their view of the universe. People talk about what they want to talk about, and if you want people to talk about these other things you're more than free to try and start those conversations, but if they don't want to talk to you about them you can't make them.

Thanks for that tip.  I checked it and compared it to the other device here that works and there were some differences.  On the slow machine, I had two options checked: 1) Sync with NTP when a user logs in and   2) Get user/group list with NT4 compatibility.  I unchecked both of them and it seems to have improved significantly. It idles at between 20-30% CPU.  The "smbd -F" process still takes a ton of CPU when it's in use but the ADS thing and it's CPU sapping is gone!

Yep. I was about to buy a ring and everything. Then she started acting weird. When I gently inquired she said I wasn't showing my love like I used to and that she didn't think I loved her anymore. I was broken. I had already given so much to her. So for the next few months I did everything and anything for her. Desperate to prove my love.  Then she suddenly comes out one day and says that SHE is the one who doesn't love me much anymore. What the hell?  Then she went on to mention how she was cheating on me. And that she wouldnt stop. And she wouldn't break off the relationship. I had to be the one to do it so id look like the bad guy...  Took me almost two months to proccess what was happening. And then I broke it off. She spread rumors and lies among our common circles and I have one friend left.   Messed me up good... Took me like 2 and a half years to get myself together after that

You are making a pretty standard german inspired dish.  As a corn fed midwestern boy this is my comfort food.  Normally I just do apples or potatoes. I would leave out the apple sauce though. It might be too sweet.  You can also add some dijon mustard or onion soup mix.
I havent played witcher 3. But to be honest, I don't think any game deserves game of the year. This year had good to ok games. But nothing that really really blow our minds. I feel like MGSV was a good game. But not the game that I pictured as a send off to the series.

You go into watching every game with literally zero expectation. During the Tarnstrom, Morozov, Fata, Kraft, Koltsov years I watched because I am literally addicted to Penguins hockey.  It just ends up being something to do to pass some time after work.   Watching 82 games of that type of hockey gets as anxiety inducing and nerve wracking as watching 16+ games of playoff hockey from a good team Usually alcohol helps,  but it sounds like you're just right under the drinking age.

From paper: magnetar flares[11], neutron star mergers [12], white dwarf mergers [13], collapsing super-massive neutron stars [14, 15], compan- ions of extragalactic pulsars [16], asteroid collisions with neutron stars [17], quark nova [18], and dark matter- induced collapse of neutron stars [19]. All of these mod- els considered FRBs as extragalactic burst sources. It is worth noting that some other models, which suggested a Galactic (i.e., Milky Way) origin for FRBs, have also been proposed, e.g., galactic flare stars [20] and atmo- spheric phenomenon
It conveyed the emotion I wanted, that's the main reason for the choice.

Well it's handy if you've broke your camera and need a new one in a pinch like in OP's situation. Now they just need to add props, motors, rx/tx, and frames. Then it will be perfect for all enthusiasts.
Fish and chips in Australia too. Here's an easy way to understand what we call everything:  * Chips = What the Poms call crisps, so things like Doritos, Cheetos, Lays etc.   * Hot chips = They're kind of like thick Maccas fries, you usually order them from fish and chips shops or pubs, but you can buy them in the frozen section of any supermarket (but if you don't have a deep fryer than they're kind of shit). Most people will order them with tomato or bbq sauce or a tub of gravy if they're normal.  * Fries = Thin hot chips, like the ones you get at Maccas. You can get fries at some Fish and Chips shops and most supermarkets though.

This is a very strange way of killing him.here's how i do it. this if from your pov.  Start on his left arm.  this is what seduces which is the biggest threat, burn that down asap. normally the wing and left leg dies by the time the arm is dead.  After that jump up and kill the left and middle head, the reason for this is the middle head does damage to the ground.  After you kill the 2 heads, assuming everything on the left side is dead, just stand on the ground and inch your way to the tail, you should not be taking any damage, his tail can one shot you, never ever ever be on the ground on the right hand side.  once the tail is done its ezpz, just kill the right arm and right head. the right wing and leg are always already dead from attacking other things.  i would assume op is probably getting one shot from tail damage which is easily avoidable, you shouldn't even move to the right side untill the tail is already dead in case you fall or whatever. seduce arm is top priority.  **the only deadly combo is getting seduced with tail still alive, it only makes sense to remove the seduce first because the tail is easily killable otherwise.always blow everything on the left arm, once thats down the fight is easy**
* Visit a town that won't allow weapons. See who can successfully smuggle a crossbow.  * Inundate the party in chests of copper. Far more than they can ever carry. Then give them a few harried but easy battles. Easy if they hadn't ditched their crossbow because it weighed to much.  * Rob them of their weapons and have them use makeshift weapons for a time. See who can make a 'makeshift' crossbow.  * Break the bow, see how easy it is to get it repaired  * Break the crossbow, see how hard it is to get repaired  Acknowledge that even with all those scenarios that make the bow superior, crossbows still replaced bows for good reason.  
Yeah im trying to make it happen.
If I recall correctly, Germany did have them under official surveillance for many years. 
So if I just download a bunch of episodes of a show, watch them myself, and then delete them it would be ok?

thats what I thought but then I realized that is 12 bytes shy.   Then my attention went back to the boobs. 
See I guess maybe I'm more forgiving because in the end, what I truly cared about was the characters themselves, not the actual mystery of the island. Which is what the creators tried to emphasize when the finale came out too, that the show was about the characters, and that's it.  And I just loved the characters in that show. They were all wonderful. And I bawled like a damn baby during that finale, especially after realizing this was them meeting each other in the afterlife, after death (in the flash sideways).  The show just really impacted me in such a way that I feel like I always have to defend it, despite the criticism the ending gets.
I suggest this: War Paint, you still need that, FA, Follow Through, WotB, Aftershock, Furious Blow, Nexus Blades. Give it a try.

I've never treated it as being additive. You have two blank spaces, and each die fills one space. __ __ first d10=4 second d10=6 so 46. 00 and 0 (or 10 and 10) is just the ticker rolling over so you end up with 1 __ __. Still works with a 10's d10, just ignore the zero and always treat that one as "the dice on the left."

All the cringe is located in the comments section. 
Agreed, good ending.
it gets released when the hype has died for a consistent 3 months, probably
From observing other producers like oshi people get gassed of consistency.   So if you save up 10 tracks and say ok I'm gonna drop one a week you have 10 weeks to make 10 more.   Now you are constantly in peoples feed especially if you get some reposts. So if people didn't check it the first 3 times they are like yo I keep seeing this fucking name let me check it out. If it's good, boom more followers.   It's like a how radio can make a decent song a fucking hit if it's in the a list because they will play it so much that it gets into people's heads.   I plan to do it but I only like 1 out of every 15 songs i make so it's like 1 a month for me which is pretty weak

Are you talking about finger picking?  Lots of acoustic examples in rock. Perhaps one of the best is Jorma K. from Jefferson Airplane on Embryonic Journey:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBGDRoFDUPY  Edit: You mentioned Hendrix and SRV - see examples of their acoustic picking on YouTube.  Both players are heavily blues influenced, so if you are looking for only current bands, search something like "acoustic picking blues rock".  Otherwise (i.e. you don't care if it is current), the world is your oyster, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBGDRoFDUPY  [more examples at http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/the-30-greatest-blues-guitarists-of-all-time-264246 ]

Stat wise, orion is better, but utility wise... *sigh* her arts only hit once, while her NP gain isn't bad per se, probably she wil scores more NP on AQQ rather than getting arts chain.  Having Arts NP doesn't help either, they are hard to be fully utilized for her own brave chaining, since she won't get the 20% NP, for comparison Buster will still deals even more damage in Buster Chain, and Quick still gives 10 star bonus in Quick chain, Arts, basically they are 'used up' of its usefulness after reaching 100% NP.  Her actives, are not so bad, but really not specialized either, having secondary on Mind's Eye is not desirable, since Mind's eye should be saved for enemy NP, and critical damage should actually be flexible, their functionality are contrasted that it's impossible to be fully utilized except by sacrificing other effect.  Also, being old gen servants suffers, they are HEAVILY outclassed by the sheer utility of newer servants, while DW seemed to anticipate Gil's consistency (because AUO), this isn't the case with Orion (nor Atilla).   The little tidbits, she has Sky, Divinity, and Archer class.   Being an Archer, she will deal 0.95 than she actually is, so let's reduce her base attack by 550~, Sky deals slightly more damage against Earth and deals lesser damage against Man, most of the servant in the game are Man.  Now her signature skill, Anti-Male, seems so good, 50% damage, but let's see, it's only active for a turn, there are only few monster which is classified as 'Male' and most annoying and strong servant bosses are Female.   Artemis herself is classified as 'Male', since it's Orion who was identified as the servant, she's an absolute nightmare as bosses. But isn't as deadly in player's hand.

I don't know much about film, but that looks like an amazing haul.   My partner got me some sweet stuff. Been looking at tripods for some time but was feeling overwhelmed.

Very happy with the haul this year.   I ended up getting him the 35mm f1.8. He's pretty happy as well.

Yeah, pretty much. I'm keeping it all DIY. A work lights from the hardware store kind of deal.   What I plan to do is backlight the subjects with work lights and then have the black lights hanging near them and they'll have black light paint on their faces.

He's about to get the message "look, the only reason your altcoin is sitting pretty to take the Bitcoin throne is because Bitcoin has voluntarily strangled itself. Your altcoin has the same noose on it right now, want to take it off before it gets tight?"  We'll see how "squarely" he's in the small blocks camp after that. If he still is, then yeah, by all means let's move down the line and see who's on third. Seems like a pretty convincing argument, though.

As a pyrotechnician, I did find it odd that they went ahead with the fireworks. In my opinion, that wouldn't allow much room for error if there was an unplanned incident relating to the display or crowd control.

My feet were cold so I put on bedroom slippers, but now the insides of the slippers are wet because my feet started sweating, and now I have to either deal with moist slippers or have cold feet (also I'm too lazy to find another pair of bedroom slippers)
that's pretty good comeback tbf
Fuck I pressed back. But basically everything is nice, I just said you should mix the vocals a little better in the beginning because the beat overpowers it. Also you should change your name because how are people going to find you? Would they look up "flow rapper soundcloud"? You should make it like your id Flow Tha Great. 
If your computer is already compromised TOR will do no good  Running vulnerable applications like torrents will also compromise you and Other people on network  You  may want to  modify your torrc file and avoid exit nodes in 5  eyes  As mentioned already here and on TOR website, enable NoScript always. Also remember TOR is just for TCP  You can isolated VMs like Whonix or Booting Tails or PfSense + windows to only allow TOR connection  If you are paranoid use VPN + Isolated TOR  And then there are rogue nodes. A adversary controlling both your exit and entry node can de anonymize you (Although this very hard). Avoiding this 100% is hard. Running own Exit node and using it may help but tor changes circuit every 10 mins on normal so you will need many exit nodes to remain normal.  And yea there is nothing to worry abt someone breaking the encryption unless they build a quantum computer  I cant give links for further reading as i am on mobile. But google is your best friend. You may wanna startup with the TOR white paper and other research papers

$40k isn't very low, the median household income in the United States is $52k and the topic was specific to people with a mediocre income.  I'd be curious to see the breakdown of how you're paying a 35% effective tax rate. Are you self employed?

The answer depends on if you expect your investments to outperform  paying down your mortgage interest. If you are paying 3% interest, and your investments would have returned 8% in that time period, you would have been worse off. If your investments were flat, then putting the money in mortgage would have been better, since effectively that money was earning 3%.  You didn't tell us what your RRSP is invested in, or your mortgage interest rate, so there is no way for us to estimate.

Baylor was a great team before all the injuries. Baylor would have competed with any team in the country. Injuries suck.
You have to evaluate it without hindsight. It wasn't a given that Kiko would get hurt, and it's not a given that he'll never be an effective NFL player. It's premature to make judgements about that trade. Would you say it's a good trade if McCoy goes down with a career ending injury next year?

My clothes and hair. I hit like 12 and my mom just kinda threw up her hands and told me I could do what I wanted. Of course I ran with it and ripped all my clothes up, started mismatching my socks (this was almost fifteen years ago before it became a total trend and they sold them that way), and tried to get as "edgy" and "punk" as I could. My hair's been pink, purple, blue, green, red, brown, blond. The only thing that really stuck after these years is my "punk" jean jacket, a preference for distressed jeans, and my pink and blue hair.   A lot of my friends in that age bracket had parents who were very touchy and sometimes even uptight about certain colors, designers, styles. They thought my mom was the coolest for letting me dress however I wanted. 
OU's inability to run the ball or stop the run on defense is reminiscent of UNC's struggles against Baylor. 
6-0  EDIT: Here's an actual reason  I've just been more impressed by M2K's play than Mang0's, especially because, since August, we've seen M2K place in the top 3 of every tournament he entered outside of HTC Throwdown, a tournament that I think we can all agree was a little unusual since it was a single day affair. Compare this to Mang0, who placed 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 17th in the same time frame.  I've just been very unimpressed by Mang0's performance in the latter half of 2015.
Personally I doubt it. But like many others here I would like it to be true. Simply because if he isn't a Sith Lord, Jar Jar Binks is truly just a pathetic blight on the Star Wars franchise.

I'd like to reach my goal weight, in 2014 I lost 15lbs. I mostly kept it off this past year.. Until two months ago in which I've put on 2-3lbs. I need to lose another 25lbs to reach my goal, which shouldn't be too hard as long as I stick to it.  I'm also going to tackle my IBS issue and do the elimination diet. I will be so relieved once I know and can get rid of which foods are triggering it.   Another goal is to continue passing and keeping my grades up in nursing. My worst class is physiology.. Only one semester left of it thank god!

Hey there, I noticed that you're talking about an event, primary, or caucus in your post! You may already know this, but there's a great ridesharing application to make it much easier for people to attend Bernie events together, **and ultimately go to caucuses and polls together with the goal of increasing voter turnout!** It’s called RideWithBernie and it's integrated into the official Bernie 2016 Event map. There's just 3 simple steps to set up your rideshare and make Bernie proud:  1) Locate and click on the event you wish to attend on [this map](http://www.bernie2016events.org/#zipcode=&amp;distance=50&amp;eventtype=R&amp;eventtype=CW&amp;eventtype=E&amp;eventtype=D&amp;eventtype=B&amp;eventtype=O&amp;daterange=all-events) and then click on the blue “carpool” button on the event popup. 2) A page will appear with basic instructions that say: *How ridesharing works: Fill out a quick profile. Contact nearby drivers or passengers. Confirm with text/phone calls.* - click to the next page. 3) Then, just fill out your first name, phone number, and location you’ll be leaving from in the text boxes - and then you’re done with set up!

I don't think you understand.  You dying and having Taylor's memories as your own but kinda fucked up because  " oh its a dream " is still fucking stupid. I fucking hate the BO3 campaign and just because it's all mystical and vague about everything is a terrible design.  If I am to be playing a game with a vauge story I should understand it after the end, you shouldn't be like " wat " throughout the entire play through, and I shouldn't have to sit down and look up 600 page Reddit posts and go over in film slowing down mission debriefings to make sense of a story.  It was stupid and not fun through the entire buggy unplayable turd it was.  BO1 didn't make sense at times, but later you understood what everything ment later, I  am seeing all of this and I understand what these numbers are because this, or Menendez with all his cryptic talk meant this, in BO3 its " nothing makes sense, and this isn't fun. "

This is the problem with this FOMO social media society we live in. Most people are just going to be chilling at home, and then 2 out of 273 of your friends are going to be out in some loud, sweaty, dirty club with a bunch of gross people...and then they're going to take a picture and you're going to somehow feel like you're missing out.
&gt; deliberate confusion  The very idea that a woman would say such a thing is pretty fucking chilling if you think about it.   It's like something out of a torture manual.  *Keep the enemy combatant in a state of deliberate confusion*.   
BME is an unusual discipline in that it isn't very well defined. As such, you'll have to fight harder to convince an employer to hire you over an ME, EE, etc. For this reason, an MS with a thesis will give you the chance to complete a major project, which will be proof of your capabilities as an engineer. In general, an MS will be more work than an MEng, but like others have said, I doubt most employers really care. But for BME in particular, I think you'd be best off with an MS and a thesis.

You'd have to dig moats to keep the dogs away from the supports unless you fancy suddenly finding your base toppling from lack of supports.
It's never too late.
My mom actually does this. Not enough to actually turn, but steering wheels usually have a bit of give so you can turn the wheel slightly left or right and it doesn't turn the car. I gave up trying to make her realize she can hold the wheel straight. Now I'm a bit fascinated by it and just watch her and observe. Like National Geographic or something.
I've never understood why people 'friend-collect' on Facebook. I have about 60 friends on there. Some are family, some are old school friends, some are people I work with. They're all people that I'm interested in keeping in contact with. If people add me and don't talk to me, then I delete them. I've no interest in people being nosey.  If I saw that you only had 30 friends on your Facebook, I wouldn't think anything of it at all.   I think you are overthinking this way too much. 
If it doesn't look like its moving, it's coming right at you. 
no worries...Ohio State gonna get worked tomorrow
If you deleted notifications after opening a chest, no.
It's pretty representative in the way that most answers lean progressive, non-religious, non-traditional and so on.  One thing I've noticed (happily) is that people here are very aware of things like racism, which unfortunately is not a well understood subject here in Scandinavia. It's pretty impossible to get a conversation going about it. While the people I surround myself with do not hold racist views, to my knowledge, they also unfortunately don't really care much about it unless it directly affects someone they know.
Rule 3: do not ask for meet ups
On fuses: I agree sometimes. If your unit went kaputz out of the blue, something else is probably wrong. If it died after you did something like plug in speakers with too low an impedance or you bought it broken (and don't know why it failed) then replacing them is fine.   On the radio section: I didn't mention the radio section because I've never dealt with them and am in no way qualified to discuss them.  On caps: it can get spendy (both $ and time) to replace ALL the caps. It certainly is a good idea, but not necessary in many cases.
Ugh, I can't understand why everyone is slobbing this show's knob like it's the second coming.  I watched one episode and thought it was pure garbage.  This can't even hold a candle to the vastly superior Daredevil

Sounds like a plan. 
What? No. I'm talking about them moving the show to Friday night, panicking when part of season 3 was leaked, switching to Nickelodeon's God awful streaming service, and the budget cut that happened when they were making the 4th season.  I loved the last scene. I shipped those two sence S3E1. Ironically, that's the only thing I give nick some credit. I could have understood if nick said "we aren't going to take the risk of blowback."   P.S. Name drop /r/korrasami if you doubt my shipping cred.

I'm very very certain that that is what he said. But I'm also not at home and don't really want to try to that part in the video on my phone 
Did you not listen to the commentary. Cops were all over that night looking for this shit. They do that from time to time.   Reaction time has nothing to do with it. The cop can easily see down the road behind OP. Its not like the cop can only see what the video shows. Knowing a car wont be able to stop at a red light because of how fast they are going isn't that hard to do. As soon as the guy broke the law, the cop went after him and radio'd for backup, which is why they're so far behind. The other cops were sitting at other intersections looking for the same shit.
Anyone know the source?
I just saw this article, obviously it's one of those "in 10 years maybe" type of things that often fails to materialize at all, but just the thought of it got me excited.  Even if it was prohibitively expensive, just a bunch of these existing out there seems like it would be a huge boon for the illicit pharmaceutical market.  Being able to print diamorphine and fentanyl is as good as being able to print money, no way all those machines could be kept locked up tight enough to escape the inevitable temptation.  The authorities will try their damndest to crack down but we know how that goes, the failed war on drugs will turn into the failed war on drug printing.  Fun to think about. 
This was actually pretty entertaining.  I'll have to show my friends later. 
Misleading title. Below the video, in a weird mashup where it's hard to tell if it is the guy who filmed it, or the guy that reposted it, you can read that the filmer (who is the probably-unbalanced guy pushing the button) asks for an ID on a guy at a certain time stamp in the video. Because the guy pantomimed drawing and pointing a gun. Not sure there was even printing involved. 
Just did. All my FLAC files are analog now. 10/10. 
HK-47, IG-88, IG-86, Poggle, ST Han Solo.   Solo is the sacrifical lamb that gives your damage dealers a few extra turns to destroy the other side before they can even react. Only downside is if the opponent just focuses Han before his taunt since he's slow and has low health. Even then, that's damage not on your more valuable characters.  It's an all or nothing comp, and the fight will be over pretty quick, one way or another.
That's a bold assumption, or is it a hole in the arm joke?

I don't have the Anova (was just passing through this subreddit), but from photos (like on page 10 [here](https://support.anovaculinary.com/hc/en-us/articles/203861170-Anova-One-User-Manual)) it looks like it may be a standard C13 connector, the same type used on the back of desktop computers.  So you can probably head down to the nearest computer or electronics store and buy one. Given that it has a heating element and thus high power draw, I'd opt for a heavy duty one like [this 15A one](http://www.amazon.com/TRIPP-P007-003-3-Feet-14AWG-Computer/dp/B00JT0DG94/).

Yes and he was SO smug in that recording. Like a chihuahua proudly pissing on his territory, it made me rage.
Blood and Iron. Maybe it's the descriptive buildings or the suspenseful warfare. Or maybe the dashing cavalry charges that you must defend. Or the catchy music. I just love the game.
What's the score?
Nope. Israeli ID cards have only NATIONLITY now. Both Arabs and Jews have ISRAELI under that category. Again, you need to refresh your arguments. And the ethnicity is now removed with **** instead.
You're supposed to do ppl 6 days a week, so by splitting it up you would have no rest day. Just go trough it as good as you can, you will adapt.

I want to get this good with Ryu. He looks like so much fun but it's so hard controlling how hard or how long to press A and using the different moves to combo with him.
iPSCs coupled with 3D cultures will provide the greatest insights into human disease in the long run (especially diseases that cannot be effectively modeled in animals) both in terms of general understanding and drug discovery. Cell based transplants are just starting to be trailed but they have a long, long way to go before they become mainstream.
Holy shit. How many people died? How horrible. 
No problem, there are quite a lot of anime light novel adaptations so if you can also look out for those series you found interesting to see if their light novels have been translated too.
The context for that joke? Geoff from Achievement Hunter said it (phrased a little differently) in one of the early MineCraft Let's Plays.

Tee shirts with animal print or animal faces on them actually add 5% muscle mass per print or based on the size of the cat/wolf. Little known fact. It's like how stickers add 5hp to your mom's civic.
Jiro Dreams of Sushi is my fav. Chefs Table series is an excellent follow up. 
I always give my partner the benefit of the doubt and trust them until they do something that would make me question that trust. Ask yourself if the feelings are justified. Her simply talking to other guys isn't cause for alarm. Her ignoring you talking to other guys is.  Her spending time out with friends isn't an issue. Her lying about where she was or who she is with is. You can trust others, it just might take you a bit longer. Keep an open line of communication with potential partners. 
I'm gonna tell you what I told the other guy. I think you have "someone who wants to not wear a seatbelt" confused with "someone who is asking you not to judge people while they're in the hospital for a tragic mistake that hurt themselves". I mean you're acting as if they were driving drunk. You're calling them "idiots", meanwhile they were just doing what 99% of humanity does, got in an extremely rare and terrible episode of turbulence that most people will never experience in their lives, and are now probably going to be too scared to ever fly again. And you want to sit here and call them idiots? People like you are what's wrong with humanity.

LoL is easier to get into on an entry level, but I also honestly think the skill cap is higher. Without the turn rates and with all the low cd skill shots I think the best LoL players are better then the worst by a larger margin then in Dota 2. 
I don't think it's extremely disturbing, because even if that *was* a man (spoilers: it's a transwoman) they look like a woman, to the point that you have to be a major jackass to fault someone for thinking they are.
Jungyeon obviously, she should be apart of the vocal line in Twice....she has pretty good range from what ive seen of her  But she has only been given a small role in the debut single, and then she didnt pick the song when they all decided which Christmas video they wanted to do (her fault i know but still) and she's been sick lately since before the last Twice TV so she couldnt have even done that Running Man performance that Jihyo, Chaeyoung, Tzuyu and Nayeon did even if she wanted to  The debut hasnt been all that great to her skill set, but she has shined in variety and she has a good amount of fans so i cant complain too much  I feel like she is really gonna shine in the comeback  Edit: Sugarman not running man
Thank you for the input! And by putting their label on it, are you referring to the ASIN?

Biggest issue I see with getting your chest up. Perhaps the best way to go about this is to position the bar a little lower of your back, and really focus on contracting your lats, pulling down on thew bar and keeping that chest up. A focus of big breathes between reps should also help.  This should help you falling forward, as a strong chest and tight back should keep everything moving more up and down.
Simpossible! Mac version was the best! 
No. "Good" doesn't do it justice. I have an adolescent jealousy of all your mirrors.  On a playground this would be the point where I tug a hunk of your hair &amp; bolt to the swingset; making gut churning eye contact soon after.  Ridiculous crush on you...ugh.
The kids on Xbox Live would disagree on the last sentence
Well yeah it woud be nice to have some way to get a higher Chance for an angel room by an often seen item , but if you have the key they are a lot more likely to get one. The Lost.... I like him.... I like him MORE than Blue Baby. I woud even say..... Blue Baby is the Worst Character... Hard to get Devil Deals , a Shitty Starting Item , and nothing intresting. The Lost has a the Spectral Tears to hide over Rocks , Free Devil Rooms , The D4 + Holy Mantle for a Risk/Reward System. About the Keeper.... Yeah... He is a Assaholic Bitch , but he is Very Intresting and unique so im not gone sweat it that he is so Bad and Hard , because First we had a Secret Character that was BS than we had him Buffed , than Buffed again so he is a balanced Character and than we got another Secret Character that is BS but at least he is unique.  
Hope more stuff like this comes out so people shut up
No excuses if they can't get the win tonight.  A few days rest and no long bus ride should have them ready.  
Some people tend to hold grudges for things that happened when they were younger, and would jump at the chance to validate themselves in the eyes of people they were previously intimated by.

Came from the S6E to the 6P and holy mother of Android was it worth it. I'd say nearly every department on the 6P is better except for the camera department. Don't get me wrong the 6P has an AMAZING camera but if you ask me the S6, S6E, S6E+ and, Note 5 have the best camera on the market as of now. Also the 6P does age better and is guaranteed to be supported by Google for at least 2 years. I would take the plunge if I were you.

I had this issue for couple of weeks and then 6.0.1 fixed it.
How do you know whether it is a Nexus 5 or a LG G4?
I feel like a guest at the Red Wedding right now
Will update later but my first response to this us insurgency is very different from all the other games you list because you only need one shot to kill.
The jump from Normal to Classic feels like a difficult spike because that is the point at which the game starts to teach you about loss and how to deal with it.  Several changes from Normal to Classic make this apparent:  * The A.I is unshackled, meaning they will (almost) always take the "best" course of action against you. They'll do things like aggressively take flanking shots or lure you toward other pods if the pod has a single survivor. Sometimes, they'll forgo a shot to lob a pinpoint accurate grenade at you. You have to study and learn all the enemy's new tricks and traps if you want to survive.  * Having a satellite over a country is no longer guaranteed to keep them in the project. At max panic, a country has a 50/50 chance of defecting even with a sat. Without a sat, up to 4 countries can leave at a time, rather than 2. You have to race to stop abductions completely if you want to stay safe.  * You do not start with a free sat, making panic management in the beginning that much harder. You also don't start with the OTS, making getting those squad level upgrades take longer. Your tactical play has to compensate for this.  * Global panic starts at 8 rather than 0, meaning countries get to red panic even faster with fewer abductions. Unless the RNG is absolutely perfect, you'll need to learn to go without some funding or bonuses.  * Soldiers get -1 HP, meaning they die easier to even normal shots without ranks or armor to keep them safe, especially early on. Aliens also get a plethora of stat bonuses, too. You have to learn and get confident enough to bring lesser ranked troopers in the tactical game to absorb losses you would not have had in normal.  Getting that perfect play on Classic is very difficult and at times up to RNG completely. But trust me when I say that you are meant to lose some things in Classic. That jump in difficulty is all about learning to cope and carry on despite taking a licking. Impossible is similar, but takes it to the extreme. You have to carry on with even less.
At the 1970 Mr Olympia, neither Arnold not Sergio would leave the stage during the pose off. Arnold told Sergio that they should leave so the competition could conclude, but when Sergio walked off, Arnold stayed and made it look like Sergio was quitting.  It's not fixed, Arnold just tricked him.
The problem with your argument, the thing that totally invalidates it is that you assume that any form or definition of "conservative" (or "Conservative") equates to racism.   Racists can be conservative, liberal, socialist, progressive, libertarian, or apolitical.  There is no causal connection between conservatism and racism. If you think I am wrong then provide proof. Simply because someone is a conservative and a racist does not mean that trait is consistent among all conservatives. Racism is a personal defect.   Conservatives are opposed to Liberal political philosophy. Liberal philosophy is a strict, static path towards socialism and control over the people by elites. Liberal philosophy is no longer a simple desire to expand rights and freedom as was the classical definition at the time of the founding fathers. 
hes a highballer :D
Okaka, when i first heard that he was coming to our club, i was kinda hesitant in thinking it would even be a good signing. He seemed slow as fuck but his workrate is really good and bullies alot of his defenders in the matches we play with him upfront. I still see improvement in his game but he definitely proved me wrong thus far.
omg this made my 2016
Article says she had a flat tire and continued to drive on it and another motorist called it in.
How is it not repetitive to fight the same 30 enemies over and over and defeat them over and over just to try to beat the boss?
I still don't get how she is 28 and OLDER than her more mature looking sister
The guy was an American homosexual being detained in Russia. He was willing to die for his cause, and I'm pretty sure him hanging himself in the very room she was sleeping, with Claire's own scarf, really struck a chord with her. He would rather die than go against his beliefs on live television, admit he was wrong when he knew he wasn't. I felt that guy was a very powerful character, personally.
Too soon bro
Since you are only 4 months out, I would start with your OB if you liked them. You could also start with your GP if you feel more comfortable. If you have an open insurance (pretty much anything that is not an HMO) you can go on their website, and find mental health professionals in your area that take your insurance. If you are not sure how to do that, feel free to PM me and I can help you out. (I work for a well known hospital and have dealt with almost every insurance known to man). I am really sorry you are going through this, just know that you are not alone. I know my first few months after the birth of my daughter were rough, and even now at 7 months out, I am still getting my anger/emotions under control. You are making the right choice by deciding to get help!
Ever been to Kennebunkport? There are three large black cars out in the big driveway all the time and sometimes you see the guys in suits walking around in the front yard. The house itself is on a mini-island of sorts with a long driveway that is either a bridge or a spit of land. 
Haha wow.
It's a starfox reference XD  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIkJvY96i8w
It's not. That's how I got my steam friends list filled with people. Granted, I hardly see any of them, but I've made some friends that way.
I am quite pink and pale, so I use a lot of foundation which can wash me out and make me look flat. I actually use my bronzer as both a "keep me from looking like a cadaver" and also as a contour,  but usually its just one or the other on any given day. Like OP, I am having a hard time finding a contour color that works well with my coloring.
It's a long story, but he went to high school with my sister so I heard a lot of stories about how much of a douche/dick he was. That's why I don't like him. Had I said Crosby or something your point would make sense but there's a personal level to the hatred
And Trance and Romi! Beka's eyes scared me though, it was like she was seeing *through* people. 
what are you talking about fam
How would you rate it out of ten?
I quite agree, but I want to add one thing. Secretariat's advice to young Bojack was to keep running whenever he gets sad. Before the scene Kelsey's note was that this is the moment where Secretariat decided to stop running. So after the shot Bojack is thinking maybe it's time to stop running. 
No worries, if you got it from GTS it's likely hacked so you can keep it, I'll still give you the terrakion though, jut give me a minute to sort out some other trades.
He also didn't have to share the ball with a 300 pound veteran who was 10x better than the next center in the league at the time for his first 6 or 7 seasons. 
Smokes and molitovs on this map are really easy but super powerful! 
Συγνώμη ... Τα ελληνικά μου είναι πολύ κακά, αλλά προσπαθώ να μάθω!
Sorry I did teach myself to hate myself as a safety mechanism. :)  Perhaps you can write in an attempt to find purpose? I heard a while back great authors have done this, their novels were a search, and the finished product the answer they found.  Can I hear your music somehow?
I did this morning for a ship confirmation for today as well.  I've been on the Medibuds ship for a while (3+ years) and feel confident this is nothing. 
Yeah.  The TH snipe defense made the game pleasant for a lot of people.  Supercell needs some way to compensate for the added unpleasantness.
It's the OU way. 
NightSkyline - Shortland Anchorage - Lvl 100  Started around end of March - early April 2015  [My Fleet](http://i.imgur.com/iOx9bbN.jpg?1)  For my first (half) year, it has been very progressive overall. A lot of hard-to-get ships have came in this short time (Yamato, Akizuki, etc.) so I'm really grateful for that. Overall just the growth of the fleet and all the progress through the maps and Spring-Fall events are my pride and joy. Notable shoutouts to:   -**Haruna** (especially) for finding Yamato, single handedly carrying Spring and Summer events while the fleet was still in its infancy, and just being the prime vanguard of the fleet.  -Choukai for her contributions in clearing event and monthly EO maps. Your sister is the Queen of AA saving the fleet from the plight of bombers, but you are the executioner with your god-hand day and night battles. Others helped wipe floor of enemy fleets, but you were always the one to put the final nail in the coffin.  -Yukikaze for her godly cut-ins in the darkest hours. Another event and monthly EO star, your torpedoes sank even the most ruthless of bosses in times the rest of the fleet was heavily damaged.   -Shoukaku for being boss despite her short time. I promise to get you to K2A before January ends. -Everyone else in the fleet. There's too much to name, every ship has their special moment and their contributions this past half year have impacted the fleet one way or another.   -And then there's you guys here. Thanks for the tips, advices, memes, etc. It's been great so far, keep it up for the next year.  For the next year, Musashi and Zuikaku are top priorities. Teruzuki and Unryuu if the chance comes by. Their sisters are lonely without their siblings around. Also to be more prepared for events and overall stockpiling. All my events thus far always start with average 20k resources and 100 buckets...absolutely horrid for farming and progression in general. Lastly, learning to fleet set-up properly without always relying on guides, advice, composition suggestions etc. Too often have I stuck to looking up info for maps and compositions and following everything word for word, really doesn't help if there's certain equipments or ships I lack.  Happy New Years everyone.
That reminds me, I have a Logitech G110, and the H key wont work while I am pressing the S key

There are some f2p games that are purposely designed to make the user feel frustrated in order to get them to spend money.
You're a bit late on that one - this one's called the Address and is a chain hotel. The Torch caught fire a little earlier in the year.
refs making up rules as they go along!
Yeah, I was a little confused at first, like, "why did this get upvoted, they're not great dancers or anything...". Then they through to the fly doing a backspin, and it was completely unexpected. Could've been even better if they were great dancers maybe, but either way, funny gif.
Everything is distant, and empty. It's like your soul is dead. I've been able to will myself to work, function, and do well, but every social interaction is taxing and hollow. It is like another job. It is an act. You forget what happiness and sadness *feel* like. Imagine a spiral that keeps repeating, an optical illusion. A broken record. That is how your thoughts play out. On repeat. All the time. You forget how to be human.  From that hollow interaction, You realize how lonely you are, and that this is how it will always be for the rest of your life. Even though you crave a connection, it doesn't seem truly plausible. If you have people around you all the time, you're still always alone. You will die alone and be forgotten within a generation or two. You want to be forgotten. Humanity will be forgotten eventually. The cold, expansive universe does not care that you or anyone else are here.  It is a weakness that hides behind absolute truth. It is a leech that sucks the life from your soul and a sickness, a weight, that clings to every inch of your flesh, working hand in hand with gravity and decay to lure you into your grave. It is a whisper that you do not belong to this world, and only to the void will you feel at ease. The void calls us all home.  I should start a cult.
Isn't he only essential for the first part of the game? Surely he should be killable by the player after that part is done, and then it's up to the player if they want to kill him or not. Sure, that might mess up the ending or what-ever, but you still have alternate paths. Let me mess up your ending damn it!
Yeah seems like the Crest was all I'd been getting, my first game as a titan though had a exotic chest drop. "Figures....wait was is this the trantella....faints dead away from too much blood rushing to my head"

Apparently it was needed, since you missed if the redskins win this week, the record would be the same, and who knows what tie breaker would be in play. We'd never know, since the redskins and cowboys go either way the last couple years. We lost to the romoless ones this year, they lost to colt McCoy last year. Who can say? Though I recall quite vividly everyone saying the redskins would easily lose week 17 in 2012, and we remember how that went. People still have the taste of crow in their mouths.

I think the filmmakers were trying to show that Avery &amp; Dassey were wrongly convicted; i.e. didn't get due process - and in that respect, some bias would be inherent, and some bias - and we could dispute exactly when and how much there was - is used to counteract, as I mentioned earlier, the inclination of some viewers to assume they're guilty simply based on past behavior, and by assuming that, lose interest in whether they were treated fairly or not. Personally, I don't think it's used to portray Avery &amp; Dassey as innocent, but I suppose some might view it that way. For some people, Avery's innocence and lack of due process go hand in hand, but that's not the case for me - he might very well be guilty, but that doesn't deny him the right to a fair trial.

I like that idea, I think there will be kind of a self-hate aspect to some of the younger people that live there, while the elders do their best to help them understand that they're not monsters.

I'll give a shot at explaining. The Asian financial crisis is an uncommon black swan event, unluckily, China faces even worse challenges that require hoarding of trillions in reserves. China, for example, has huge capital outflows every month that devalues their currency. To stem the outflows China needs to prop up the currency and the only way to do that is with reserves. China has reserves because of problems like this, a lack of stability in its own currency, lack of trust in its own currency, and finally leading it to value having the currency of its worse rival more than its own. This is really bad. China is a huge country and should have no problems spending its money and borrowing at great rates... yet it does. Because the economy is not stable and the country is not stable. Avoid mainstream media like the plague on any economic topics. People like Romney have been saying that China devalues its currency in order to support exports. However this is not really true, has no desire to devalue its currency because it corporations borrow massive amounts of dollars. If Yuan goes down billions of dollars of debt will be added to corporate balance sheets. What China is doing is propping up the Yuan (with reserves) to support the corporations. However in order to get into the SDR China would need to let the Yuan float more, hence the current devaluation. See "Mundell's Triangle Theory."  So yes having reserves is better than not having reserves, but not needing reserves is better than having reserves. China should stabilize its currency and political situation and then spend all the reserves, invest in the military, education, healthcare, one belt one road, environment, etc there's tons of things to do. Hoarding cash is a sign of weakness, hopefully by 2030 or whenever you think China will become a real superpower this situation will be reversed itself.  Japan's reserves are political baggage because it has a high debt to GDP ratio. Meaning, it buys T-bills because America wants it to buy T-bills. There are a bunch of books about this. In reality the reserves are barely relevant considering Japan's own debts.  Other Asian countries like Korea and Taiwan have a geopolitically insignificant amount of reserves. But you can be sure their T-bills are also politically motivated.

Well fuck then, you're right. Why should we put police officers in the way of harm over your $60? What's the value of a human life? A heart and lung transplant runs around $900,000, so we'll use that as a value for life. Let's make all theft under $1,000,000 legal so we don't have to worry about a thief killing a witness that saw their face on the way out the door. After all we don't want anyone "putting a pretty cheap price on your life and potentially the people's lives around you". I can't imagine how that could ever go wrong, can you?

I liked the idea of seeing comparisons and parallels between different books, but this way you'll never directly compare in the same list, say, any two Gospels.  I guess the only way to fix that is to scramble the lists (maybe every time you finish a book you pick another book at random to start).  It also ^*cough* ^^^leaves ^^^some ^^^books ^^^out.  I might try a modified version and see how it goes. Maybe something closer to [this](http://nathanielclaiborne.com/prof-horners-bible-reading-plan/).
I don't know how to feel about it. I've "completed" it, in that I've gotten Neutral/Pacifist/Genocide/[Genocide-Pacifist](/spoiler). I like it on the merits of not having to have to fight/kill enemies, but I dislike the bullet hell segments after a while since I feel like they distract from the game itself.  Even now, I don't know if I could recommend it to friends who aren't into games like Earthbound or other such games that aren't too traditional. It is a game I recommend to play more than once, at least, but the more I think about it, the more I question my own decisions regarding it.
Grats! I REALY want her, so jealous of you!

&gt; Authoritarian vs Libertarian in my eyes is the real struggle.  I highly recommend this book - http://www.amazon.com/Conservative-Affirmation-America-Willmoore-Kendall/dp/0895268116  Brilliantly written series of essays that speak to that point. I, too, struggled with Libertarianism for a while, and Dr. Kendall's work was instrumental in helping me sort that out.
That's why I think there is hope that it is finished. If he is joking I think he's doing it because he's done. If he isn't joking well, he's probably got a lot of people that hate him now.

I think it's a losing battle to try and argue against this being a rehash. It's just too similar to a New Hope. Remember, a rehash isn't a carbon copy. Although, an argument could be made whether that's a worthwhile complaint or just being nitpicky.  As for Lucas, he's out. If the prequels and the edits to the originals were "his vision", then I'm good to let him go. So I think your friends are wrong to treat that as a valid complaint against the movie. They shouldn't judge this based on what some other guy *might* have done. Still, the movie does have problems. I didn't like some of the odd conveniences, like Luke's lightsaber being on a random planet at a random cantina. And I'm in agreement that Rey's character was too perfect. Can Luke even teach her anything? Other than that, it's still a fine movie that can be enjoyed despite some the holes.

"King" is relative.  There's a notion that the blood of a king is powerful not because some schmuck recognizes him as king but because of the king's force of personality and inherent nobility.  Mance is a good example, because he wasn't born a king but was given that power by acclamation.  Khal Drogo was obviously a king as well, and Daenerys is obviously a queen.  Robert Baratheon was obviously a king.  Stannis... less obviously, though for some reason Melisandre thinks he is.  Here's something to think about: Robert's children.  He had a whole bunch of them.  Gendry.  Edric Storm.  Mya Stone.  Bella.  Plus more in King's Landing that were killed.  Jon Arryn was going about "the seed is strong", whatever that meant, but we have good reason to suspect that there's some way in which Robert Baratheon passed his king's blood to his children just by being their father.  It is *not* clear that Joffrey and Tommen, despite sitting on that metal chair, ever had king's blood.  For the characters I think of as having king's blood, just look at the leaders we know of.  Jon Snow, *yes*.  You can argue that he got it from Rhaegar.  Maybe.  Also with king's blood: Euron.  Neither is actually king, but both have the kind of larger-than-life personality that being king requires.  My guess is that this is what king's blood is.

So you would fall into what I would consider small business (sub 500 employees) in terms of an ERP.  At this level it's mostly a case of understanding that the software is generally built to do X and your actual business process is Y and finding a way of making them work together.   The core of what an ERP does is hold records and moves the data.  Basically like a massive spreadsheet that everyone can work on at once. Someone else in your company obviously signed off on the decision to implement this ERP, so don't stick your neck out.  Start to break each of the core business processes down and document them. This consulting company is obviously going to be doing the brunt of the work.  From what you have described they should be the technical and functional experts in the system.  At this point you want to make someone else sign off on EVERYTHING.  SQL requirements, server hardware specs, user functionality etc.  You basically get to play the role of managing the whole thing.  Personally I think it can be a really good career move and easy money, but if it's not what you want to be doing I would make that clear to your management ASAP.  I basically have no requirements from you other than "new ERP" so I can't offer much more help at this point unless you have any specific questions?

Why I hate mine craft now. When I started I was around the average age for the player base.cas I got 2 years older I began to get a little lover, but at the same time as every 8 year old in the fucking universe was getting their I pad, the pocket edition was rising in popularity. Suddenly I found the average fans age plummet to 4 years below me. That was a total turn off. On top of that the game was beginning to just become shitty modded servers. I wanted some vanilla fun like I had been doing for the past year. At the same time because a lot of mine craft you tubers began noticing a shift in their demographic, their content also changed in order to better accommodate that demographic. A rather small youtube I had been subscribed to since about 20,000 subs and was a fun guy (jeromeASF) later came on to become in the top 50 most subscribed channels on youtube. He completely changed his channel around in order to attract more viewers. Mine craft was becoming a business. Most mega servers would last 1/2-2 years and have some cool gamemodes, but there were always perks that made it pay to win. That really killed it for me. On top of that the uber popular team crafted nexus server was more like spy to play since higher paying people had priority into games. With the amount of popularity you basically had to wait hours for a game or spend $50 and wait minutes. Even the faction servers that stay true to the old minecraft have all been destroyed by hackers/cheaters and are quickly dying.

Why the fuck would you be friends with an ex? 
I would like to gift a game to my friend. His dog that he raised from a puppy died from cancer this year, and I don't think he has truly recovered from that. Maybe getting a game that we can play together can take his mind off of the pain, if only for a bit.
Awww.  Congratulations on your toxoplasmosis!

What type of work do you do for commercial real estate?
submissions have been closed but they've been reviewing apps during the downtime. 
&gt;Yes.  Again, care to support that with any evidence?  &gt;How about the completely institutionalized, up front, and uncontested discrimination? If a quota or AA gives women an edge, do you really think that doesn't affect men?  Your claim wasn't that there was discrimination, it was that it resulted in a tangible effect on men's income being less than womens. That requires a substantial amount of evidence. Again, I'm asking you to support your claim with some empirical proof or evidence which would show that this is the case.  &gt;This doesn't contradict what I said. It favors women, but men do it more.  But it's doesn't lend support for your argument either. Since it was being used as "evidence" of something which, in all honesty, you haven't even proven to be existent in the first place (That women make more than men), I don't rightly know what to say other than... you have to support your claims with some measure of evidence.
There are 3.9x surges apparently. When I try signing out it warns me about it?

No, but they did have that brief narration that was basically a spoken scroll. Can't remember if every ep had it but pretty much every ep I remember did.
Ok thanks! But Crab gets at least 1 RZ target a game and generally quite consistent 11ish targets (with an 8 and a 5 in there), Alfred has had some big dudds. Does look like Alfred does well at home though.

I have both on my team. I think it really depends on your style of play as to who is better. Stammer is amazing off of the rush. He can skate, dangle, and shoot very well. His shot from the high slot is unparalleled. Ovi is a cycle/puck possession monster. His checking is ridiculous along the boards. His balance is also really good so he can hold onto the puck really well. Both have amazing shots and one timers. I would say there is an extra 200k that you're paying just because it's Ovi though. 
I thought they already got a penalty on the sideline.
thats not dyel jesus. Im not saying thats good progress but he looks better than the majority of the population, all he needs is a quick cut. 
Yeah, they're more like Fireboards than Hoverboards.
U r so pretty hun
a Top Tier character should have some simple kill confirms, a good recovery, and easy follow ups from grabs. Cloud has 1.5 of those. Disqualifies him from Top Tier, really

I am fairly certain that this is not true. I've know the writers have mentioned a list of pre-approved names that they take most of their names from.  Quite a few fan names for background ponies have been canonized, but that's a bit different.
Is your friend's phone missing the IMEI as well?  Also if the game is on the play store it should be safe from those types of shenanigans. Not all types of shenanigans of course but those ones at least. So you could get it again from there.
Really enjoyed your write up, thank you for it.  It is easy to slowly slip back into that lifestyle, stay vigilant!   Your ability to identify this as a marathon gives me confidence that you will succeed in maintaining health no matter how the specific goals change.  You are really gifting your children an incredible blessing in many ways if you can.  Great Work!
Goal #1: Write down everything you spend, and stop spending on anything not completely and urgently necessary.  Goal #2: Put money towards emergency fund / debt. Make this a line item on your spreadsheet, and treat it like a bill if you have to.  Goal #3: Figure out your career goals. A masters can get *super* expensive and may not get you a career that makes the expense worth it, and cities are pricy. There are a lot of horror stories on this very forum of people saddled with grad school debt and still working at low paying jobs.

&gt; If it's true what they say about sequels being worse than the originals, I weep for humanity   Actually, Kent Hovind's real "sequel" (that is, his son) actually is worse than him in many ways.  He leans very heavily on presuppositional apologetics.

Everyone mentions this. Then a small percentage of fans come to their "friendship" defense. It's fucking ridiculous. Winning matters, a bromance does not. 
Get both. They're both amazing games. 
That's not that bad... but your time was cut significantly shorter because you used assets. I could probably stealth it on 75 detection risk as well. It's not too hard.   Keep in mind without assets moving the bags added in like 10 extra minutes for me. 
I was with you until the last bit. This is wrong and is very unlikely to be the case:   &gt; By the way, I'm guessing most people who are willing to assault other people over road rage are more likely to be packing than most.  Carrying a weapon in public has a way of calming you; has a way of forcing you to be rational and analytical. Understanding and respecting the weapon and everything that comes with it is large responsibility and it weighs heavily. I don't mean thugs walking around packing heat but licensed concealed carry holders intending to protect themselves.
Yea ya'll can get screenshots of sad OU fans but you can't get screenshots of the Clemson cheerleaders.  You all should be ashamed of yourselves.

In prisons, its common and sometimes mandatory practice to segregate the inmate by race in order to maintain the peace.   many inmates get released later in life and reintegrate that racist survival mentality back into society.    can never get over that fact.

You could also work on accepting the status quo, and rather than staying in lane against the malz look for roams to get your kills. Think less about the brainlessness of the champ and more about the situation they put you in. It seems from your list of malz and annie that you're frustrated by their ability to just push a button and magically with no room for counterplay you are dead. Just accept that this is gonna happeneed and rather then getting frustrated by the fact that it's true challenge yourself to find creative ways to deal with it. (Roaming, helping the team get vision control, farming jungle camps, teamfighting or split pushing when appropriate). TLDR: view these brainless champs as a challenge to find ways to win a game through creative means

Who said anything about domestic violence? Domestic violence is *at home,* usually between spouses.   You made the claim that "Every time a woman turns down an advance, she risks a violent reaction (either verbally or physically)."  Show me the data.

&gt;I gave that show an honest try  So did I. I heard so much about it, but I only got about half way into season 2 before i just said fuck it and moved on with my life. It felt like it was written by a bunch of high school freshmen looking to impress the senior girls. Normally I don't give up on a series. Like, there's always a part of me who wants to know what happened to a character(s), regardless of how terrible the series is. Not SoA. I didn't give one single shit about any of them.   I'm still shocked at how highly acclaimed it was. 
I worded it poorly but it's not practical. I feel there's too many units to go too deeply into the game tree. I don't even want to imagine how hot my phone would get crunching a mass witch attack.
I miss Coupling. The US version made me gag.

&gt; When I try to add my movies, for example, it shows the individual disks rather than the shares I have. This means that my media is spanned across 3 different HDDs, but appear as one "media share" as a networked drive.  Sounds like you're adding a library and starting with: /mnt/disk1/Movies or /mnt/disk2/Movies  That'll only show you specific disks.  To see user shares which are the aggregates of all the disks, navigate to /mnt/user/Movies
Never too late.  I moved out at 26.  I didn't have to pay rent and had a good paying job so I just saved and saved until I couldn't take it anymore.

BalooUriza, my friend, I have to respectfully disagree with you. Every county in Oklahoma voted for the Republican and against Obama in both 2008 and 2012.   Every congressional district easily elected the Republican to represent them in Washington.   Oklahoma had some proud progressive history but every county in Oklahoma today is Republican and they are not moderate.
Ok, I always thought that you and I saw eye to eye, but that just ended with your post. I really don't give a fuck which way you turn the lunch tray. It's gotta be pretty horrible either direction.

I gave up on nursing bras after my first kid.  It's surprisingly difficult to find actual nursing bras past a certain cup size.  I sure as heck didn't wear them in the hospital, but I'm the sort of person who doesn't wear a bra unless it's 100% necessary (as in, I'm not entirely sure where my one and only bra *is* at this point).  I've never in my nursing life worn a nursing tank.  They just don't exist in my cup size at all, near as I can tell.  (I'm a J-cup at this point, and praying they don't get larger again once my milk comes in like they tend to.)  Both things, to me, go in the category of "Probably nice to have for most people." I've never done a birth plan.  Well, I've written them out for myself, but never turned one in.  In theory, if you have one it should be in your file, but I'd definitely print out a copy to hand to your nurse when you're in a room.  I've never given my nurses a gift.  I've intended to give something to the midwives, but never managed to.  You will have one or two nurses during your labor and probably the same during recovery (depending upon shift change), but once you are on the postpartum floor things can get a little weird.  One hospital I was at was a teaching hospital and I lost count of how many different nurses I saw.  As far as a lactation consultant goes, I'd call and ask questions beforehand, especially about training.  I had a hospital admin for the system I deliver at brag that all of their nurses are trained in lactation, but when pressed he couldn't tell me *how* they were trained, and honestly my experience has not been positive overall, though to be fair, at this hospital someone always did stop by to see if I needed help.  If you've got the finances, and have trouble, you want an IBCLC-certified lactation consultant.  You may not need one at all, though.  It's possible to have problems breastfeeding, but it's also possible not to, and occasionally getting hung up on doing it the "right" way makes things harder.
