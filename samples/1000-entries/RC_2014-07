Interesting. See, I love popcorn, but HATE movie theatre popcorn. It's too damn salty. It actually dries out my mouth enough that it hurts after eating half of the smallest bag they sell. 
honestly, performing is one of the few social activities that gives me the least anxiety. i get more anxiety going to a dinner party or being at an airport. i think every anxiety disorder is different. mine is mostly based on small human interactions and conversation rather than being in front of a lot of people singing and dancing. it's kind of odd, to be honest. 
The hardcore fans obviously have no problem with it, based on the reactions/voting in the comments every time this subject comes up. But for regular fans it sucks and it becomes difficult to follow the rankings. Even if these were free cards, don't tell me PPV cards haven't been weakened by running weekly events because they have. 174 was pretty weak in my opinion.
There really isn't a reason to buy ALB at this point. If you already own it, sure it's fun to go back.  But I'd say go ahead and buy RD if you're wanting MP and are considering any sort of ranked play.

Yeah, I agree, you can't force yourself to be attracted to every guy. Hey, I'm not really that attracted to every white guy that I meet. The thing is that when someone is walking around saying "I'm not really into Asians", what they are doing is associating a huge group of people with a stereotype that they have in their mind. How do you know that you're not attracted to someone who is Asian? Have you met everyone single Asian person? Do you even give them a chance, or do you just automatically reply with "Not Interested" because they may look somewhat ethnic? The fact of the matter is that RACE is not a scientifically proven way of classifying people.

The only thing I actually remember and I don't know why was some dance with my great grandparents. I was sitting in my grandpa's lap and he was just dancing with me and playing with me. He died that night in a car accident. It's not a great memory to tell but the visual is unreal.

&gt; She was constantly in her bed with the curtains drawn during that time, and wasn't herself for weeks, but perhaps that's what it was.  Well, that confirms it for me. It was *definitely* a performance. Depression doesn't come on like a freight train out of nowhere because your friends tried to calmly explain to you how they feel about some things that you can do and can be fixed. And it certainly doesn't magically cure itself in weeks.   She played you back then by deflecting the blame. It's just like her refusing to accept responsibility for her actions. Classic manipulation tactics.

Not that you should or would care about my approval, but I respect the hell out of you for this. I think there should be a general agreement not to be a dick to people who believe differently, even seemingly irrationally. I especially think this should be the case when someone volunteers to do an AMA. However, I appreciate that you don't pull any punches or ease up on the pertinent questions while making sure to phrase them respectfully, in an earnest attempt to seek his answer to the question.

Well, to be fair (though I'm pretty sure this is not what she means), money devalues certain things becuase it adds a thrid iteminto a trade. So say you are a poor farmer in Thirdworldistan. You could trade 3 ears of corn for 3 packs of sugar. When money is thrown into the mix, now you cannot trade your corn, you must first sell your corn for money to buy your sugar with. So you sell your corn for 5 bucks but a 3 packs of sugar costs 6 dollars.   The capitalist system actually did hurt tribal areas because it closed off trading routes. NO trading routes means no wealth or information. It's why ares in Kenya, the Middle East and so for which were very rich and prosperous in the Middle Ages went to shit when Europe moved to a capitalist system ahead of them.  But again, I know this is not what she was talking about

Don't overlook MacProVideo/AskVideo. They've got the biggest overall selection of DAW/plugin/production videos, and the quality is generally quite good.  MacProVideo and Groove3 are more about tools and techniques whereas Sonic Academy is much more specifically focused on EDM and achieving a certain sound or genre. I respect the Sonic Academy guys, and what they give you is good for what it is. (They also sell a couple plugins which I like quite a lot.) But I've definitely found the Groove3/MacProVideo selection much more immediately and broadly useful.  Depends on what you need though; if you WANT a lot of stuff about "how to sound like X" Sonic Academy is the way to go.

Fleet Street likes to think it makes teams successful. When it is proven wrong it doesn't half get its proverbial knickers in a twist.

So baseball was a gripping and popular sport to you ... in the 90's ... as a kid ... who probably collected baseball cards and played little league. Most adults find baseball incredibly boring. Just look at the ratings the world series gets, it's pathetic. Cycling was never even big in the states until Lance Armstrong. And it was gonna lose popularity here as soon as he retired, no matter the circumstances. We just like cheering on one of our own. Don't be naive.   I just don't believe that Sonnen being a commentator, mostly employed by Fox, is going to lose MMA fans. But this is an empirical question, you can prove me wrong with data, though anything less and neither of us will budge.

&gt;(not naming names, but they might be located in either the Czech Republic or Nashville)&gt;  United and Pirate Press, I'm assuming. I don't have anything from United (at least that I'm aware of), but I have to agree that Pirate Press is hit or miss with their pressings. I have a few albums from PP that sound great, while others are just meh. Unfortunately, their main focus seems to be making records that are visually appealing rather than aurally appealing.  &gt;It also could be that, like record club pressings of old, the Hot Topic editions are manufactured by Hot Topic under license, to crapper quality standards. Sorta doubt it, but stranger things have happened.&gt;   Now THAT would be interesting. Pretty unlikely, but I could believe it.

One day, my boyfriend in high school ran away from home because his mother wanted to take him to Mexico, and he thought it was to abandon him there with his abusive father. He ran to my house. They caught up with him right under my bedroom window, and I ran outside when I heard the shouting.  His mother was trying to grab his shoulders, his grandmother was standing a few feet off looking worried, and his sister was crying and telling him to get into the car. I walk up to him and hug him, and he hugs me and starts sobbing. His family goes quiet and lets us stand there for a few minutes.  I walk him to the car and put him in the backseat. His mother gets in the driver's seat. His sister pulls me a few feet off and thanks me for calming him down. She tells me they haven't told him yet (because of how he reacts when he's upset), but he has to go to Mexico with them because this morning, his grandmother died in her home there.  Me and his grandmother had spent many hours together becoming friends despite her speaking no English and me little Spanish. She left me a pair of pearl earrings.  TWIST ENDING: His mother actually did leave him there with his dad after the funeral, so fuck her. DOUBLE TWIST: He kept tabs on me for years, eventually approached and rekindled a friendship, though I was engaged to someone else, and when I wouldn't be with him, he raped me and tried to stab me repeatedly. In all seriousness, every word of this is true. I've posted it a few others times from memory. It remains my only confusing "otherworldly" experience, I am a gnostic atheist, and I don't believe in life after our death.

In addition to the other comments, it's important to note that "Paki" is used as a slur directed towards just about everybody east of Turkey and West of Thailand.

That's not what is happening.
you're analyzing the lyrics of a song for partying and having fun, which makes you sound kinda lame. For what it is, the song is good. It doesn't need to have complex lyrics, that isn't the purpose of the song. Idk why people expect impressive lyricism and innovation from party songs, you're looking in the wrong place.

As much as I would love watching these guys play Risk, it would probably be frustrating due to all the pieces. With Risk, you sometimes have 30+ units on one space, and trying to organize that would be hell. Either the pieces would clump together like cards and be frustrating to take apart, or they wouldn't clump at all and be really irritating to move. That being said, it would be very entertaining either way.
Hey. I've added you, please add me back buddy!
It's a cool idea, but from a game design standpoint it sounds like a nightmare.  &gt;These monsters have survived confrontations with Hunters before, when you face them they will show visible signs of scarring, maybe their tails are already chopped off and they have a healed over stump in its place  Oh great, that's a whole bunch of new part models to code.  &gt;They'll actively try to dodge the hunter's attacks, if the hunter starts up a spirit combo with their longsword the monster will react and try to move away from the final hit. If a gunner is pointing their weapon at a veteran Great Jaggi for example, it'll do that large backhop it does except as a sidestep instead to stay out of the hunter's line of sight and away from the shooty end. Etc.  Oh look, now we have to make the A.I. more complicated for a very specific set of circumstances.  It's a neat idea, but because of the additional code it would require, it would end up taking a bunch of content out of the game for a feature a lot of the longtime fans of the series might never even see, or it would end up taking longer to make, and do we really want to increase the time between releases when it is already so long?
If you want props, you can probably get spent shell casings from any gun range. Or, just take a dremel tool and cut off the end of a blank.   Or, learn to shoot, and then you'll have plenty!

Out of the 2 I would say try out ALBW. It is a little easier to get into, a little shorter but still a really good experience.   OoT is one of my favourite Zelda games of all time but it is time consuming, fairly difficult and a little dated.

Great post. I can identify with a lot you have said. So what's your plan now? 
Fair enough. I just had to build my second crafting (actually more than 2, because of workshops), but that makes more sense.

Apple usually had the highest prices on contract. Everyone else is the same or lower.  The rest is up to you. When the iPhone 6 comes out the 5s and 5c will drop in price.   I would go with at least a 5. 
It means both "questioning" and "queer". It has been added because it emphasizes the discovery and acceptance of one's identity (questioning) and because a sizable chunk of individuals all-out reject the "traditional" categories of LGBT and the gender binary. Queer encompasses the LGBT community as well as intersex, asexual, and two-spirit individuals...AS WELL AS polyamorous heterosexuals and others that fall outside of the perceived "normal." Reasons for it's usage include promoting solidarity among all Queer individuals and because some appreciate the ambiguity of the term. It casts away many of the barriers and pressures to conform and pick a label ("well what are you??") that come from both the "straight" community and queer community alike. 
they have to choreograph and rehearse. And probably do special appearances.  Not to mention the insane amount of working out they have to do to look like that.
Absolutely he was over-hyping it, and consciously so. The game struck a deep chord with him and he wanted to do them a favor back so he recommended the hell out of it to everybody in his usual blunt and extremish way.  I really doubt even TB would deny that.

Because the expectations are the highest of any rookie I can think of since LeBron. Because he has the attitude and mentality it takes to be a star. Not saying he will be but if there was any place where you HAD to be a star and you would be absolutely destroyed by media and fans if you provided anything less. Its the Lakers. That being said, as of now he is our starting 4 on a team with limited scoring options. That could change in free agency though.

I run Relic of Progenitus in all my decks and Bojuka Bog in all the black ones. Instant speed gy removal is pretty important against Undying/Persist shenanigans.  The specific cards you'll want to run are dependent on your deck as well. Relic is the best all-rounder because it hits everyone's graveyard, cantrips, and can keep 'yards under control without being cracked. If you had Salvaging Station though, something like Nihil Spellbomb/Tormod's Crypt can be used repeatedly. Cards like Dimir Doppleganger and Scavenging Ooze are good for removing reanimation/recursion targets while also being useful creatures on their own.

Regarding OSX......   It's long... but I would recommend slowly and carefully reading through this thread: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5533298?start=0&amp;tstart=0  Make sure you read all 3 pages.. because on pages 2 and 3 are some simple suggestions about System Fonts and setting your Contact Card as your default identity. It could also be 1 of your conversations includes an Emoji or something that is corrupting, but if it were, I'd expect it to break iMessage on your iPhone as well.   My suspicion on reading through all 3 pages of that thread.. is that you've got some corruption (in the iMessage application) .. but I'm not sure how that would ONLY effect the OSX and iPad.. but not the iPhone.   That's really strange.   Don't be dismayed/discouraged that Apple doesn't know the answer to this. Their software/OS is incredibly complex and not everyone can know everything. The great thing however about being alive now (in 2014).. is that EVERYTHING is on the Internet... so this problem most definitely CAN BE SOLVED.. you just have to keep digging and be persistent.

I love greentext creepies because most people suck at writing, and you have to be great at writing to make a story spooky.  With greentext, it's about the events of the story itself, and not the writing, because the writing is supposed to suck and be basic.  It allows people with good ideas and shitty writing skills to still get those ideas out in a way that will spr00k ppl

Yeah I certainly disagree with that guy. 
After not getting needed bonuses from New Vegas (missed by two metacritic points) Obsidian bosses had to lay off a bunch of staff. They gathered everyone left in a huge meeting and basically declared "We're not going to make buggy games anymore." They made some QA software that will automatically find bugs and alert the coders, instead of the traditional way of having testers playing the game for hours and writing it down.

&gt; Because it's ridiculously easy for women to get laid so if they give it up easily, they're probably not that high quality.  How does this logic only apply to women and not also men?  The sad part is that, in the end, we all have urges.  Women's sexuality is suppressed because men fear raising another man's children.  This is much less of an issue nowadays that we have paternity tests.  However, this double standard has a major disadvantage *for men*.  Namely, we all get a lot less sex because women are taught that their sexuality is somehow more valuable, and finite (consequently, a man's sexuality is infinite, and thus, worthless).  The double standard represses women from acting on their natural urges, even when there is no logical reason to do so.  I have an example: once I brought a woman back to my place after a hot first date.  She wanted to fuck me, *bad*.  And of course, I was happy to oblige.  But she stopped it and said, "I don't want to be a slut..."  *Wat??*  "How can you be a slut if nobody is judging you??  I'm certainly not judging you.  And how can you be a slut, but not me?  I want to fuck right now too!"  This logic didn't phase her.  Thing is, society tells women day in &amp; day out that they can't be percieved as "too easy."  So they hold back because of this ever-present shadowy judgemental force.  But don't worry, I fucked her the next day.  You know... because its scientifically proven that waiting 24 hours reduces your sluttiness by 97.2%.  &gt; And I treated her extremely well.  Ok, so be it.  The way I interpreted your story seemed like you were being controlling.  Still, my words are valid for anyone who does try to control someone.  Again, nevermind the moral/philosophical arguments...on the practical side of things, those behaviors ultimately drive someone away.  &gt; Fake it til you make it though, right?  This is true.  "Alpha" is never a state one can fully reach.  Its like an asymptote: you can get closer and closer to it, but never quite reach it...

1. Ask your parents. They should know. We can't really answer this, as we all have different situations.  2. You'll have to research this. Search 'internet providers' along with your area in Google. You should find some, and hopefully one or two won't have a data cap.  In order to convince your parents, if you are serious about this, offer to pay a little each month. If you have had streaming issues, try to mention it to your parents and see if they will toy with the idea of paying for faster internet. Let them know that if they are past their 6-month 'deal', that their price of internet could probably be cheaper by switching to someone else.
The point is that a person shouldn't *have* to carry two pairs of glasses with them. Especially since the fears that banning glass would allay are completed nonsensical.  No film company will ever lose any money to a recording from Google Glass. Never mind that Glass can't record that long anyway (due to time recording limits and — even if the artificial time limits are removed — battery restraints), nobody can hold their head still enough for long enough to make an even remotely usable copy.  Cams that you find online are typically done in East Asia or Russia, where you can bet such ridiculous laws are *not* going to be passed or enforced. Even then, cams are more often than not barely watchable.  The fear of Glass being used to record a film is stupid, and banning someone from wearing their prescription glasses in a cinema is discriminatory against anyone who wears glasses and doesn't always carry around a second pair (which is a fairly ridiculous notion).
Your GPA is quite good as well, going to a competitive high school is hard. I understand your troubles, I went to Clements High.   Since you are interested in architecture, try to find the email of an adviser for the college and talk to them. In my experience, advisers are really nice and willing to help.

Have you mentioned what version of dataontap you're using?  Certain versions definitely have performance impacting issues.  You mentioned block size but as long as it's a multiple of 4k and properly aligned, it barely matters for the overall throughput in my experience. If you're using de-dupe, make sure background scans are not still running and making the problem worse.  "sis status" through the CLI. Also run "sysstat -x 10"  through the CLI and keep an eye on the CPU, CP time, cp type, and disk util.  Especially during and after a snapmirror update.   Disk util will go up during and after a snapmirror.  It should go back to "normal" afterwards.  If not it might be the snapmirror frequency as others have mentioned.  There's better ways to tell but they require privileged commands.  Are you running snapshot schedules in addition to snapmirror?  Any time a snapshot is deleted, there's an impact.  The impact varies widely based on your change rate. 
Why do so many people on here hate Remerton? Full of college kids?

1. Simply put, no. My main carb source is oats, so it can't be prepped. Same with the WW pastas and breads that make a lot of my diet. I don't eat enough rice to bother before it goes bad. Those uncle bens bistro packet a are convenient and delicious enough for when I do want rice, they're too damn expensive for everyday though.  I don't have a big enough fridge/freezer for large meal preps to begin with. I like cooking, so there's no point in prepping. I'm a student with assloads of free time between class and work, so cooking's easy too during the summer.  2. No. I've tried it a couple times and it sucks to go to the gym and not give it your all. If I need a day or two off, I take it.

If you want to keep the CR the same then you just swap out one level of Fighter with the advanced template. Now you get +2 to all rolls, +2 AC, +2 HP per HD, etc. One level of Fighter is not going to give you all that. I'd also strongly suggest that you pair him with a couple of mooks or something. Even if they're only acting as damage sponges they'll prevent your players from just steamrolling the Fighter.

Have you already done something about trousers? I agree that helmet, jacket and gloves are the highest priority, but I'd suggest that if you can't afford leather trousers, it's a good idea to get at least some kevlar jeans. Hood jeans seem to be well recommended, but cost about £100. I have some Oxford jeans that I got from Ghostbikes for £45 inc p&amp;p. Definitely not as good as leather, but better than nothing.  Have a look at [Sharp](http://sharp.direct.gov.uk) for some solid information on safety of different helmets, and some indicative prices. You can shave the budget there and still get a safe helmet. The down side may be things like noise and ventilation, but even so, they should be acceptable for that.  It's probably going to be necessary to budget a bit more for a jacket unless you hit a sale. It should be cow hide, thick enough so that it bends rather than folds or crumples when you flex it, and stitched at seven stiches per inch. Armour at the elbows is valuable, and most jackets have it now.

I've seen jail broken iphones running both siri and voice navigation, and whatever else the latest phone gets, and it seems to work just as well. I'm sure Apple can come up with some justification for holding back features, but if we're going to start calling "different phones getting different features" fragmentation than it's going to be a completely different discussion.
still makes it no less true, even if you invoke godwin's law (as it were, there was an interesting casualIAMA by a soldier on the german side recently)

The only thing I have to contribute is with regards to this:  &gt; but from what i've seen theres a lot more of "all guys are rapists or paedophiles" coming from the left then there is "all gays are paedophiles" coming from the right.  In your country, maybe (Jerry Falwell and his ilk are left-wing? Since when?) but not in mine. The nastiest homophobia in politics here comes from the right - Fred Nile (NSW Christian Democratic Party), Cory Bernardi (Liberal Party of Australia [the Libs are a right-wing conservative party], even Joe de Bruyn (right wing of the ALP), for example.
I was in an FWB type relationship off and on for over 8 years. It wasn't ever some super romance, but we really had the friends part down pretty nicely. Then I had gastric bypass surgery. I got sick from complications. I was in and out of the hospital for two years, with a grand total of five surgeries. I had bad muscle atrophy and all kinds of stuff, too much to list. Instead of compassion, my "friend" would constantly get pissy when I wouldn't run to him to give him sex. Guilting me and cutting me down any time I did force myself to go hook up (when I did it was never because I wanted it, I was sick, but out of guilt and a sense of obligation.) I don't even know why I put up with that as long as I did.... Then when I lost the weight and got healthier he would constantly throw in my face that I had been sick and not pleased him enough thru my illness. When I was big he had never said anything about me physically, he wasn't overly complimentary, but never degrading. Once I was thin he would talk about my skin being loose. Tell me what I should be doing to tone it better. Telling me I'd always be ugly if I didn't have reconstructive surgery on my stomach. (I'm disfigured for lack of a better term from all the surgeries.) It just got to be way too much and I told him off. It's been about two yearsish since I told him off. I really communicated with him most on yahoo and the occasional call on my land line. Never called each others cells, really. Since he's the only person I talk to on yahoo I just deleted the app. Then a fb friend couldn't send me photos thru her fb app so I redownloaded yahoo to use for that purpose a few months back. He had left like four offline messages and as soon as he saw me on started sending more. The four messages he left were like winkies, and "boo." No apologies anything. With every fiber I wanted to verbally abuse him, but I just ignored. OH and at one point he literally just came to my house, out of the blue. Showed up on my door step. My mom and I had been talking on the porch, I asked her to stay and told him to get off the property and if he showed with out warning again I'd contact the police. Anyways, it's not exactly what you went thru, but I get the hurt when a FWB acts up like that and tries to push boundaries and stuff. I'm sorry you went thru that. He's an asshole. 
You Shibes are the Best!

Amazing comment, thanks for the feedback. I'm really surprised you played for 15 minutes :D  Yeah the pressure of the deadline has been removed now. I'll likely put a lot more time into it with more everything and more random placements.   Different weapon types is a great idea. I kind of experimented with the potato item where it changes your shots to potatoes :) So I guess I could add all sorts of crazy stuff there, like cabbage shooter, brussel grenades. I have a lot more freedom now it's over!  Thanks for giving up some time to play it, that is awesome. Thanks for the feedback too! Cheers.
Yeah they were super cool and friendly, great music performance, too!

&gt; hey even proposed that the government should pay for it. You did read their arguments, right?  Yes, and that was in Kennedy's brief outright.  &gt;Somehow they are relieved of all the burden of those dead little boys and girls because the government is going to pay for it with tax dollars that they help provide.  Uh, because when they pay taxes to the government, they aren't earmarked for services they specifically disagree with == less burdensome.  The burden is still there, but it's less burdensome than the contraception mandate.   This is almost the *entire* point of RFRA.   &gt;Hopefully we can solve all of this by repealing RFRA   lol good luck 
HOLY. CRAP.  Wow.  That was an amazing piece. Just wow. Wow.
Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart all have great long johns, hiking shirts, and shorts. 
It's a big number, but saying that it's "needed to pay for it" doesn't seem accurate. All that labor isn't in the service of providing UBI. GDP is created from supply and demand, and the things that are created (whether products or services) will still be created whether there's UBI or not. An extreme example would be if UBI payments equaled GDP, that wouldn't mean that all the things that the people in the US made (labor, gains, output, etc.) would be gone, they wouldn't be used up.  It's useful to use GDP to compare to things like taxes or the debt or the costs of wars, or paying for a program. But in that case GDP is being used like a yard stick - the ruler doesn't go away when we measure something with it.  (and in fact, there's nothing even cataclysmic or impossible about UBI equalling GDP)
in the process of doing that

I'm not a garage sale expert or anything and you probably shouldn't ask me about haggling! One time I saw a box of yarn at a garage sale that I wanted to get for my mom but it didn't have a price on it. So I go to ask the lady how much it was and I was preparing what price would be too much--I thought I would offer $5 but $7.50 would be the max I would want to pay. So I ask her, and she says, Make an offer. So I do so good and I offer straight out $5...and she just stares at me for a millisecond too long so I blurt out ...or $10. And she immediately says $10 sounds good. So I had to pay $10 for a box of yarn that I would max pay $7.50 for. So anyway, my advice about haggling is don't do that. But yeah, bring cash (usually they have gone to the bank and can break larger bills but it may be less likely if you go later in the day). I don't know about trying stuff on but it might not hurt to ask! Sometimes if a shirt's only a dollar I figure it's worth the risk. You might try to know ahead of time what looks good on you so if you can't try it on you're less likely to get something you hate.

The problem with using a single current source to drive LEDs, is that the current will be split amongst the three emitters as you turn each one on, thus dropping the overall brightness. This is why you'll need 3 separate current sources, or at least a current mirror (a current source drives three transistors, each mirroring the same current). The problem now with a current mirror, is each LED gets the SAME amount of current, but red/green/blue require different currents to achieve the same brightness, so when you switch all LEDs completely on they won't appear white.  To answer your original question, there are "high side" current source topologies, like: http://www.talkingelectronics.com/projects/TheTransistorAmplifier/images/Fig71ba.gif and http://www.eevblog.com/forum/beginners/high-side-current-source-with-npn-transistors-possible/  Do you need a constant current source? Usually a resistor is good enough for a single RGB LED, along with PWM switching to adjust the brightness.  Another option could be the the WS2811 LED driver chips: http://www.adafruit.com/products/1378 They give you 3x constant current drivers plus PWM control over a serial interface, and they're very popular.
But for what purpose? Dogecoin as a currency won't get anywhere if we use it to purchase things in USD. After all, I doubt the owner is willing to sell it for Doge, since he is asking for USD. If the community purchases it in USD after raising Doge, it shows that we're not a viable currency.  We can't keep putting all of our Doge into random projects without a beneficial goal to the currency itself or for a true cause (buying a town doesn't seem to have any purpose).  Edit: typo

Of course, if you are logging it on MFP, you can choose to add raw or cooked meat. But 100g of cooked chicken will have more calories than 100g raw chicken, since raw chicken loses water during cooking, thus losing volume.   The same goes for most foods. The nutritional value for rice, pasta, dried beans, etc. will specify that it's for the raw weight. These gain volume during cooking, as they absorb water.
There's been too much pressure on their national team for a long time. Since 2002 a lot of koreans think they're world class, that they van play with the big boys.

They should also be happy, they got as far in this world cup as Spain, England and Italy...

I think too many people think feminists are man hating, crazy, angry, loud mouthed, bitches. This is not the case. Yes, there are some women who hate men just as there are men who hate women. But a feminist is just someone who wants equals rights for men and women. I wish the word feminist was embraced more than it is. I am a feminist and I love men. I love women. I accept our differences and even embrace them. The only people I truly hate are those people who have given me good reason to.

Thank you for your reply! I really appreciate it. Its an issue that's concerned me quite a bit. Catholics seem to have it figured out.

I don't think it is this year... and I have no idea why... the show that the mod drivers put on at NHIS is unbelievable.
I couldn't disagree more. Sure Vidal is great but everyone said the same about Spurs and their bumper list of pick ups, everyone said they would make top 2. I think we will make top 4 assuming we continue buying, but City and Chelsea and Arsenal still have the transfer window to strengthen and they have stronger squads atm. Arsenal need a striker and they will be problematic, Chelsea have bought Fabregas and apparently Costa, City I'm sure will pick up players. We have a weaker squad that we are improving, they have really good squads they are improving.   I think even if we get like 5 - 6 top player it will take at least a season to bed them in and get them playing well. I'd love to be proved wrong but I think top 4 should be our target this season. One player is great, but adding Vidal won't put us top 4 to first by himself.   Also how is 45m excessive if he wins us the league? Surely if you think he can ensure PL victory 45m is nothing?

Not remotely.  I mean everybody can pay for any medical procedure/service they want.  Or anybody can pay for insurance coverage of any procedure they want.  A person should be able to buy health insurance coverage for stomach cancer, skin cancer, HIV, and influenza.  Or for measles, infertility, and breast cancer.  So on and so forth.  Alternatively, any person should be able to walk into a doctor office or hospital and request any particular service and pay in cash for it.
Great response! 
im pretty sure low frequency stuff doesnt care about where you point it because its a wave thats generated "spherically" and has a huge wavelength. from whatever ive heard, its more useful to just place it somewhere and crawl than it is to actually try angling it various areas.
Just smoke outside. It's simple. That's what my cousins and I do whenever we all get together and hangout at my huge uncles house. He knows we all smoke, doesn't really care. As long as it's not inside and as long as it's just not out in the open. We'll go down underneath his garage (he has a two story garage, except the second story is underneath the first, it was built into a hill. And it's not as big so there's a ceiling over it so you could park a quad underneath it without actually putting it into the garage. we smoke right there, bring out some beers or whatever we're drinking out with us, sometimes we're out there for 10 minutes, other times we're down there shooting the shit just having a blast because we're all lit and we're down there for 2 or 3 hours. Have fun man, I love smoking with people. It brings everyone together. 
Kennedy's opinion (for 5 justices) struck down the Texas sodomy law on the grounds of 14th Amendment due process.  O'Connor wrote a concurring opinion.  She disagreed with the majority's invocation of due process.  Her opinion would have struck down the Texas law specifically on equal protection grounds: the Texas law prohibited sodomy only between two people of the same sex, but the exact same acts between people of the opposite sex was lawful.  She would have left untouched the laws that prohibited the same acts regardless of the sex of the people involved.  So I don't know that it's precisely true to say that O'Connor was "with the majority" in both cases.
I have heard though of bishops not letting a father baptize their child because he was not caught up on tithing  But as we know there are bishops who are asshats and peoples experience my vary.

I think that's totally backwards. I expect to pay for everything I want and use in every other aspect of my life. The fact that my employer has offered to pay even in part, something towards my health care, is a luxury that I am not entitled to. My access is not limited in any way other than now **I** have to pay for the thing **I** use, and my employer is no longer going to foot that bill.

That is why you can file to be a conscientious objector that would be assigned to non-combat duties. As it currently stands, it is political suicide to even talk about a draft. Even the war hawks on the right don't mention a draft. With the military technology we have, a draft wouldn't even be useful enough to implement unless there were troops on the ground in the US or neighboring country. Don't overestimate the power of the US. There have been much more powerful countries come before us and crumbled. We are an extremely young country when it comes to the big picture. We are powerful now, but the tables can always change. An unexpected medical epidemic, economic collapse, mass technology failure,or major natural disaster could put the US in an unexpected prone position for attack. That is when a draft would be a possibility. It seems unlikely, but we should always have a plan if the shit hits the fan. If political corruption gets so bad that the draft is used irresponsibly, laws won't stop the ones in power and would be grounds for civil war.

Did I miss /s?  Than, it doesn’t matter how do you feel or that the accident happened in 1996. Personal experience is a very poor indicator to make a judgement call in this case. Police it is not only the friendly folks walking on the street and hanging out tickets for minor misconducts. That, probably maximum what majority of us would experience during the lifetime.   By design it is a government institution to enforce government will.  There should be a mechanism for those, who are the subject of these enforcement, the people, to argue their case. If you don’t agree with you speeding ticket, you can go to court, for example. Situation with this girl showed, that in the serious cases of the police misconduct in the state of Victoria there is no such option left.   You pointed out that the accident was in 1996. Yep, that’s fine. It was long time ago. Many things has changed for good since then. However you missed the point that the decision by the UNHRC was made only about a month ago. 18 years! And the people who are involved in this case are still in the force and promoted.   Trying to see everything via prism of personal experience, in what, obviously, we are all limited, is a mistake. Think about, the limitations of the rights of the protesters [recently implemented in Victoria](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/20/victorian-anti-protest-laws-pass-lower-house), increase in militarisation of the police and 18 years of waiting time to get the justice. I would say, the central tendency of changes are alarming at least.
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know man 
No more massive open ice hits to the head kind of killed his game.
It's definitely harder to tell watching an online video but I found the PS4 version to be much, much better.  The PS3 version (which I love) has a that 'haze' to it (compared to the PS4 version).  Initially, I didn't think it was really that bad so I just plugged in the PS3 and threw it in.  It's definitely as "bad" as it appears in the video...  If the PS4 version holds up to what they're showing here, it will, hands down, be the best looking game so far for the new gen consoles.
So you know it has been busted it's not a bug and it's not slower.

I don't know about tabloidesque. There just doesn't seem to be any substance.  1. How the fuck is "So we sort of assume that you’re not part of an oil company" an attempt to discredit you? In context it's perfectly clear why he said that.  2. You never established that Lush actually took any oil money. At worst, it's money inherited upon the death of someone who made money in oil.  3. If you think that a vegetarian soap seller who eats fish is newsworthy hypocrisy, you shouldn't be a journalist.  4. As far as I can tell from your own article, the man in America isn't the CEO (I think you were talking to the CEO on the phone). And it's neither surprising nor remarkable that a businessman involved in a company that markets itself as green isn't actually an environmentalist.  5. That's not a dig. I worry for your comprehension skills if you don't get the point he's making there.  6. If that's a job offer then I'm a banana, as Private Eye would say.

I work for the mosquito control in the US and I'm about 99.9% sure that females are the only ones that bite all animals. As for malaria there isn't currently any cases of it in the u.s not even imported diseases. Now for WNV yes it is very commonly currently the state I work for we are hitting the starting point of the season. As if last Friday we found our first infected mosquito so most likely two weeks from now we will have our first case. But a disease to watch out for at the moment is chickengunya at the moment it is not a major problem because the vector is only found in aedes agyptie which are mostly found in New Orleans, LA but can easily mutate and be able to be transmitted threw aedes albopictus which are commonly found all over the United States. 
[Well to be fair, being atheist doesn't mean you have no belief. It just means you have no belief vis-à-vis the god question. Since atheists do face a social stigma in some places like the southern states (not *nearly* as much as LGBT people though), I can see why you'd want to increase awareness honestly.](/ooc)  [That said, the fact they're just hijacking a pride parade to wave a flag about atheism is pretty shitty of them. I get the impression these people are *that kind* of atheist. Like the ones you definitely wouldn't want to have a beer with.](/ooc)
The only other salada post here is for a facebook like.
Petrol prices *could* go down- getting rid of the subsidy increases its price, thereby reducing its demand, a trend that *could* result in a secular decline for petrol (kind of like what we saw in America where a few month-long period of high gas prices just exploded the hybrid/high mileage car market). Of course, if India gets back on the growth engine, this probably won't happen.   This is a painful solution, but the only long term solution I can foresee regarding high gas prices is letting gas prices rise up as high as possible- force people to think twice about gas-guzzling SUVs and the like and consider fuel efficient alternatives. During the big gas crises of the 1970s, Japan spearheaded the assault on producing low cost, high mileage cars while America continued producing those really wavy, gas-guzzling Detroit cars. Guess who's still in the lead decades later?

For similar stuff, try [You Are The Light by Jawaba-a-Shikwa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGNe-4oUt2M) and [Subah by Falguni](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0koAieXkfVA). In fact, the whole [At Ease](http://www.amazon.com/At-Ease-Dharma-Moon/dp/B000FQJPLO) album is full of gems.
Am I the only that thinks that as soon as you add something other than cheese it is no longer a grilled cheese sammich? I flippin hate it. It is a meatloaf sammich!

The __noun___ swung from the __adjective__ tree like a __noun__ in the wind.
"Ugh. What the FUCK happened!" I said, waking up in the inside of a dumpster. My head hurt, and my ears were bleeding. A quick check left a swatch of blood on my hand, which I wiped off on my shirt, albiet torn and stained with even more blood. "God damn, those mafia types really miss their money. Still don't know what happened." Checking my pants, I still had my wallet. "God i'm hungry. Might as well get a bite to eat." So I walked down the streets, and I noticed a horde of emergence vehicles storming down the streets. Curious, but not curious enough to see whats up. I had more urgent matters to attend to, such as my growling stomach. Thankfully, there was Dunkin Donuts down the street. Bashful of my torn clothes, I put my head down as I walked in. But oddly enough, no one was inclined to stare at the ragged, mishappen gentleman waltzing into the Dunkin Donuts they happen to be eating at. Not one to complain, I walked up to the register, where the lady there gave me an odd look. "Two donuts and a small coffee, black." I handed her a twenty, and she gave me a jumbled mess of bills and coins, still shocked at the disheveled looking man who just asked for a breakfast. With donuts and coffee in hand, I took a seat, and stared at the T.V, not believing my eyes. There I was, or at least, there my body was, being shoved into a body bag by paramedics. Right next to that dumpster where I woke up. A raspy voice called out to me, "Dave, it happened." I swung around, and there he was. Death, in all of his hooded glory, scythe propped up on the table. "So, I guess my time is up. I cheated you enough times. And to think we were such good friends," I said with a hint of regret. I didn't want to leave this Earth, not yet at least. "Yes, we were. You played the game well, but you lost, and and now you pay the iron price. To be honest, I thought you were going to die a more glamorous death. But killed by some goons in a dying criminal organization?" Death let out a loud guffaw, but no one seemed to care. "Yeah," I said, "I thought I was gonna die that time in Afghanistan. That was one hell of an ambush. But loansharks, what have I become!" The tinge of sarcasm was hardly overlookable. "Yeah, and I was right there too. But your time is up. Come, i'll put in a good word for you. This is the end of a fun game, my friend." And with a swing of his scythe, the River Styx loomed below, and I fell, Death looming over me. They say you see I white light when you die, and that white light is Death's bony skull, whiter than a dove.  (First story here, surely not my last.)
You're Welcome.
Sounds like a too short track!
I'm going to assume that the headphones are backwards because most are designed with a cable on the left.

That's what I do. I had one die trying to get inside the airlock and his body was never removed.
add me plz
I was going to say it would be a nice place for a sling mount, but there is a sling mount on it like a half inch away.   maybe it's for adding something under the cheek riser? In looking through pictures I can't find a single photo with anything attached to that rail. real or airsoft. 
does it matter if i buy an early access or standard version?
Sometimes women your age *do* get breast cancer, but it's not common.   Lumpy breasts from fibrocystic disease or some other benign condition are much, much more common.  You are doing the right thing by getting it checked.  Let us know that everything's OK tomorrow.

Holy fuckballs, this.  I had to drop about 1800-2000 on a friend's wedding because I was his best man.  2 plane tickets for me and my SO, transportation, hotel, etc...

I've got a US account set up from when I bought God Hand but can't add funds through PayPal as it uses my UK billing address, can't be arsed going online to get US PSN monies. Ash well, think if I looked I've probably got a copy of the 360 somewhere..
kind of, there was just a single strap, it was thick and across the middle.  Thank you for trying.  Found a photo of me wearing them: http://imgur.com/DnjiOYR
Not OP, but thankfully not everything is built on a business model, particularly in healthcare. I think the telling sentence in your question was "if providing critical women's health related services is so fundamental.... then why not stop doing them?" Abortion IS a vital women's health related service, and thank Christ that people like OP and PP see the importance of that over the financial issues. 
Same to you!
Are you kidding? Jose Canseco's AMA was amazing. He was such an asshole to everyone, it was hilarious.
Who would have guessed that Colombia would be favorites among Brazil, Germany and France...
I have seen one at 7 Eleven station
I wonder why hobby lobby didn't just opt out of insurance and pay the fine. At the same time do they make their employees sign a contract that says they will not use their pay checks to pay for abortions or anything that contradicts their religious beliefs. 
Unless you're not using any of google's software, you'll see Material design. Even if you're not on Android. And you're assuming Touchwiz won't adopt material design, which I wouldn't assume.

I was placing a lot of faith on my ability to not get turned around maneuvering-wise in case I needed to boost away from a cliff face, miraculously that bet was never called and Bill sailed on through to the other side without incident.   I'd compare going through this stunt to a roller coaster, with the same mixture of "This was a bad idea", "Holy crap that's fast", and "We surviiiiiived! *kisses ground*".

It's your choice who, but do an impersonation of each other. 
Sadly, that's pretty common. I've seen them stuck to the back of the stall door in airports. Get in the stall, close the door, period. Ugh. Nasty bitches. 
I think at this point we have reached a point where we fundamentally disagree on certain things (i.e. the source of the hate towards ZeRo, the type of people that watch each event, when exactly the hate started) and as such I feel that we should stop, and we could go on point and counterpoint forever. I would like you to know that I did thoroughly enjoy this argument, I wish you well in the future. 
Those would be red monkey jeans, popular in the rap scene some time ago. Those are fake knock offs tho, real red monkeys didn't have those frayed pockets.

I pretty much use it as a play time activity since they both love the water so much. If they're bored I put them in the bath. The pool counts too for the four year old. They get baths or showers maybe 2x a week unless they're sick or it's needed. 
No thanks, GW2 taught me this is a crutch.
probably the most generic emo lyrics
I would like to see it. Adding is presets would be a nice touch like "I am always CPU bound" so that it would lower only settings that take CPU horsepower. Same for GPU as well.  I think a big issue that many players have, with getting poor performance, is having feature enabled that tax the weaker part of their system and have no idea if what is CPU or GPU dependent. So they put everything on low, and the game looks terrible.
My list only consists of champs that scale well late game, not of champs that are good in the laning phase. It's written poorly, I'll give you that.

&gt;Today, the United States has one extremely conservative party, and one moderate party.  Or a liberal party, and a left-wing party.  I mean, here you have the government **forcing** people to violate their personal beliefs and pay money for other people to do something they think is immoral.  And the Democrats are saying "it's my *right* to **force** you to buy this for me, your religion and personal beliefs be damned! I don't care about your religion or your so-called 'ethics,' because I want to legally require you to pay for it."  It's like the anti-freedom anti-religious crazies have convinced the people that they're somehow "pro-rights" by taking away basic human rights. It's amazing.
vector is about watching someone you love hurt themselves emotionally while you drift through life, wishing you could help them.  chia is about emotional isolation and how that can produce apathy towards other people who "have a life". 
Corporations aren't people, but are made up of people - we all agree on that.   Corporations are legal entities designed to limit liability to individuals - that's a fact. But why do corporations get to have freedoms normally reserved for individuals, and at the same time they can't be incarcerated or put on death row?  Corporations are made up of individuals that are already endowed with all the rights of normal people.  Seems to me that shareholders and owners are double dipping in the rights bucket. Corporations aren't people, they have no soul and usually no conscience.  They are exceptionally greedy, wreak havoc on the environment at times, and will destroy jobs on a whim if it saves profits.  They are obviously not religious if they act as they do and have no soul.  It's ridiculous to give religious rights to a corporation. 
Thank you. 
If it works like I think a raid will have a lockout of say a week. You have a week to beat it, not clear how it knows the progress I guess it will remember where the group left off provided the first to enter was present in all the runs up until then. I honestly can't remember what game it was I played that had such a system, maybe Rift before it went F2P.  Really there isn't such a system in place currently that I can think of we can base how Destiny will work off of. Until they make it clear the mechanics it's a guessing game. I know in the past some mmos people were intentionally left out of a raid to save progress to do more runs in the near future. Not sure if this will be possible or if it tracks individual progress vs group.

Assuming, of course, that the courts even pretend to care about the law. If the UK has an equivalent of U.S. family courts and if it's even only a quarter as bad as what we have here in the U.S. then the fear of financial liability seems reasonable to me.
Oh god, the bhangra one was too much. 
The comments on this article make me cringe
It's an article daily on this never really proving anything. It seems some times a witch hunt. Where are the conclusions? It is a valid question, the one I saw yesterday was clearly marked "questionable". I am not saying your wrong. I want more proof.
Name calling. It was below the belt. 
My Dad is president of a DJ company, and they not only do exactly as they ask even if people bug them for the really corny things, but they also help coordinate things all around.  People really do appreciate it.

The Western Hills viaduct was built to accommodate trolleys. Never occurred to me before seeing this picture. It explains the strange design. Also, I miss Trolley Tavern and Swallen's.

Nice try.
Maokai's buffs on the PBE make him (dare i say it) pretty OP at the moment, so expect to see a fair bit of him. I'm also expecting zac to come back because of his recent changes and the fact that he was incredibly popular when the meta was all about tank junglers. Amumu and Nautilus however, still suffer from the same problems that they did before; their early game is awful, the changes to tank junglers actually mean that their early game is slightly worse than it was before, which leaves the aforementioned champions way to vulnerable to early counterjungling; keep in mind that just because tank junglers were buffed doesnt mean that you wont see aggressive early game picks like evelynn, elise, Vi, J4 and the ever annoying lee sin. Nautilus also suffers from the fact that if you pop his shield he literally does 0 damage and until that changes i wouldn't expect to be seeing much of him.
Exactly. I know some people who only seem to end a sentence with "friend" when it's in the middle of an argument. It comes across as an insult.
Because paying my taxes in cattle and tons of wheat would work out sooo fucking well...
According to /u/kris_willis because Goodman broke the story of Mack's QO it likely came from his agent. Whereas if it came from the team Vivlamore is usually the first to know.   What this means is because the team likely did not leak the Mack offer Scott probably has received his offer but it just hasn't been released yet. Vivlamore says there will be a report soon
The going price seems to be about 70ea+shipping?  I am in Australia though, so shipping will either be $10 or $20ish, depending on how light I can get the parcel.  I'm open to offers though, I want these things gone
If you're looking for a DH bike, that's not really a good choice.  The seller says it's a DH bike, but it looks like it only has around 120-140mm of front travel, which isn't really very much.  It's more of a park/freeride bike.
Prove him wrong. I was told I would never make it as a Marine when I was in high school because I was overweight. I dropped 70 pounds in boot camp and was a squad leader by the end of boot camp. It is all about determination. If you want it bad enough, you will get it.

Thank God! The office I work at had a Rolodex when I started there. One day I looked through it and made sure everything was in the computer and went to toss it as it wasn't necessary. The bosses wife almost had a fucking coronary. Come to find out the reason she wanted to keep it is because they didn't trust the computer system to be reliable. I promptly said "what happens if the building burns down?" She had no idea how to respond. I then said because everything is backed up offsite (both psychically and online) it was ludicrous to keep such an archaic thing around. 3 years later we are still charting patients by hand and in the computer, doing books and ledgers and keeping financials in the computer, and scheduling in a book the size of a desk even though our software can do everything. My life at work is very sad and redundant.  
i dont know if i could live through the pain of that, but i have been thinking about it
Hey Max! My name is Kyle Colgan and I have been listening to Say Anything for 10 years now and I just love your music. You are a great lyricist. I just wanted to ask: how long does it take you to write a song? Do you ever just get every line, every guitar riff right away? Or is it trial and error? I love Hebrews. I was at the show in NY at the Best Buy Theater!
I like being catcalled. I feel complimented by them.  I know plenty of others who also take catcalls as compliments. Both men and women.  I don't like ketchup. Repulses me. Do my personal feelings about ketchup suddenly make ketchup bad?  No. It's just a preference. Just like your preference against catcalls. Sorry you don't like it, but the reason people see them as compliments us because, spoiler, they actually feel complimented by it.
What do you mean pull them out and put them outside?   That may lead to bugs, fungi, etc.. and stress, but if you have no other choice get a sunny spot with atleast 7 hours of direct light. 
This has nothing to do with WWE wrestling. The maneuver is an arm bar and it is a very common joint lock used in ju-jitsu and MMA.

He shoots a little too accurately at the opposing goal keepers. If he could find the corners, I'm sure he would be a fan favorite.
I love my early poor efforts, as they make my recent models look good. You might even want to re-visit the Chipmunk one day... though you could surprise yourself.
Uhh yeah? It didn't seem relevant at all.  Incremental zfs send|recv is pretty nice and not mentioned... cpio can be pretty fast (piped to nc, etc).  The 'mbuffer' util is also handy for optimizing network transfers.  Pipe any/all through pv and you're pretty much set.  Then you can get into the whole other world of mcasting the data.  You can really push a set piece of data efficiently to a ton of nodes or just back and forth with lower overhead that way.
Haha I think we were all in shock and too upset to do anything.

WELCOME, TO MONDAY NIGHT CENA! "JOHN CENA SHOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW JOHN CENA SHOWWWWWWWW!"
Your mother has made me want to watch Johnny 5 now. Last time I watched it I cried like a baby.
Lovely
Weird, this story totally reminds me of the movie "Baby's day out"- a kid's movie I watched when I was younger but now that I'm older has a really sick plot. 
REPO and The Bastards both do a good ransom business.  They also have forums with their ransoms.  What I've noticed though, is that they do way more PVP than ransoming, and don't seem to use things like ECM and smartbombs.  
Being stalked. He watched us. Called us and told us we was warning us. Described our clothing and what we were doing. Creep.

Yeah, I'm a big fan. It acts on your pituitary gland, but just improves overall functioning, not encouraging it to produce more of one specific type of hormone or the other - just enables  it to better find the correct balance. It's great, IMO.  Have you tried replacing coffee with tea (even mint tea if you're trying to eliminate the caffeine variable)? If you don't even like coffee, it could even be a placebo effect like your brain is saying, "I'm taking my medicine!" and responds positively.  That said, caffeine is a stimulant and that's standard treatment for ADHD so it could be an example of self-medicating when your emotional reserves are getting low. But if it's cyclic like you're describing, I'd start at looking at hormones and when it occurs. I swear my hormones make me think and feel all sorts of weird shit that I thought was just me until I started observing and experimenting.
&gt; literally a decades old repost  Almost had it, it was actually one score and 2 years ago now.

To put this in perspective, he is older than James Harden. And the same age as Kevin Durant, who just finished his 7th season.   But Kane will stick in the NBA. He has the talent. But he's too old for a team to draft. 
Might be a codec issue, yeah.  Try opening your stuff with different software. I recommend MPC with K-Lite Codecs which you can get at [Ninite](https://ninite.com/). Or get VLC, since that will play literally anything.
I really like your response mike, even though the OP is bashing you, you've side stepped the situation and given an actual answer to first part of his post instead of just sending an abusive response like some others might. Good work! 
Our editor thought it was.  Keep in mind this was his first experience with a ufc simulation.  Regardless it's a pretty intense and fun game in my view.  What do you think of it?  Thanks for the feedback.
Did i overlook Andre Johnson... or did he not even make the top 100?
180cm, slight overweight, smallish hands,normal feet and I love BMWs. So nope.
Where is this ground wire exactly ? And the abs module
I'm going to sound insensitive but why didn't you just kill and eat the injured chickens?  Good luck on your stitched up chicken, hope it gets better!
I guess it really depends on the nature of the stuff that's to be released.  Although I do understand the distinction between when it's released.  My point was more about if Snowden is considered a traitor right now since he's already done so much.  I would think that he would be convicted at the moment if he were put on trial, so anything else he releases isn't suddenly going to make it worse for him. 
I think the favors should start out small and painless for the mage.  And over time, they become gradually worse.  After completing many favors, the mage would become used to doing them, and perhaps progressively tougher will saves would be required to refuse.
It was actually a different sale the [Great Steam Treasure Hunt](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/The_Great_Steam_Treasure_Hunt). You basically had to buy 25 or so games then complete an easy achievement in each one (usually 20 minutes per game if you were just grinding for it).  You had to buy a few newish games for a relatively small discount (RUSE, Empire Total War, and Black Ops come to mind) and they didn't tell you the reward beforehand so it was pretty dumb to go for it at the time.
Not WTF but I get it 
I am gonna hold you 2 that

Yeah, that's why I posted a link where you can watch them online via illegal uploaded files. I simply found the show really interesting and it seems others never saw it. Marketing plug. Sheesh.
What are you doing for birth control now? Are you still fertile?
The point of the deck is to make them think you are zoo then surprise them. This is one of the most underplayed decks in the metaaa.......
It isn't there. No one knows where it is. My guess it's stashed somewhere in some rich dude's basement and he isn't telling anyone.

Okay, that makes sense.  I'm sorry for not quite understanding what you were going for there.  Hopefully someone else will know.  
Unless it's changed, just unplug it from the PC and press the PS button. 
So my best bet might be trying Corki or Kog? My ADC mechanics are decent, I love playing Lucian, I'm just having trouble figuring out what to build and haven't been doing very well in ranked with him lately, so I want to just explore some other options!
mmm... They do have good meth.
Valid point but that issue doesn't seem to be as apparent as you'd think.  There are countless ways to play this deck out so you have to play with the cards you got post mulligan.  If you didn't get images, wyrms, lepers, juggler, then you have to accept the fact you aren't putting early damage into him.  Which means your win condition changes later game.  If you don't have those early rush cards, it means you either have a sick burst combo or lots of card draw... either isn't very bad.  If you don't get the early rush then it performs much like a typical giant freeze deck.  I think the vods cover about 15 games, most of which I won.  You can see how I typically am like "SHIT, this is gona be rough" after a mulligan, but with the variety in the deck combined with the fact your opponent doesn't know what you have, make it quite successful.
Good luck, you'll do great!!!:)  I only want a kindle but I will take anything
I just bought these today too, went out and played with them and they are great!
um lets see some normal pics without the banana up your butt expression then we can make a call on it?

You're stepping on top of your comments. Can you address your first comment of church and state separation? How is that applicable here?
WWP has helped a lot of my Marine buddies who were in a dark place at one time.  They give much needed support to those who really need it due to life altering physical and psychological injuries.  Thanks for supporting them OP.  It means more than some stupid yellow ribbon bumper sticker (I fucking hate those things, but that's irrelevant).
&gt;Caliber isn't what makes a gun easy or hard to shoot, generally speaking.  I feel like you're trying to talk down to me on this one. I've been shooting for 10 years, so please don't. But, I digress, caliber affects recoil.. which can make it harder to shoot. I hate shooting .45 because it's "snappy" compared to my 9mm. Some might like having a .45 instead. I said 9mm/45 because they are usually the "go-tos" for home protection (aside from a 12ga or 20ga with slugs.)  &gt;If a stalker sees you with a gun and sees where you keep it, they may either steal the gun and commit a crime or even use the gun against you, as they know where it is, too.  Well, assuming you're over 21 (the legal age to buy a handgun in the first place) you could also get a CWP, and keep it with you, or you can carry it in your car without needing a CWP. (I.E. it's always with you.) If you're home you can keep it on a bedside table, or right next to you if you're not in bed. That way it's always by you. I personally keep mine within arms reach..  &gt;Definitely a shitty situation and it sounds like it is still ongoing. The fact that the guy has a young girl living upstairs makes me wonder whether he isn't actually the target here. I'd just get a dog.  Dogs are a good investment. If he knows you have a dog he can bring a nice juicy steak for him, that'll shut him up real fast- Unless you get a trained guard dog, which will run you a lot more than a handgun. If I had to pick one or the other I would stick with a handgun, though, If you could, I would get both.
Sorry you're right, Wow that's embarrassing
For some reason he won't offer to move to my town, I don't think I had ten villagers o.o can I just check quickly?

Wait, garlic can't go in the refrigerator? I've been having to keep that and onions in there because it's too damn humid in my house and it keeps going bad so fast. 
Im Lebanese, and one thing you notice is that a large portion of highly educated men move to other countries to seek their success. My Father moved to the US to finish his doctorate in medicine and to work here, while I have many uncles who moved to work in Saudi Arabia, Canada, and several other countries. Highly educated women tend to stay within the country. Maybe this also occurs in other Middle Eastern/North Africa countries.
I'm waiting for the Israeli hired shills to come on here to explain why this is anti-Semitic. Seriously, Israel advertises and pay college students during summers to troll social media websites. It's a disgrace.
The guy killed you with G36, jumped into a heli and you accidentally refused the revive. Refusing revives show your killer on killcam but medkit on feed. And the guy could've jumped into the heli after he killed you.

The way I justified it is that he was trying to delay the progress that you made until he had as much power as he could. One of the reasons why he didn't let you die right away may have been because he wanted the satisfaction of killing you himself, knowing full well that you would destroy everything he threw at you. What an ego boost it would be, if after being revived over countless times to bigger and more badass enemies, he would be the one to finish you off.  That's just my theory. It's probably wrong though.
I would go 200 shipped for you
Thank you again! The movie idea seems great. I was thinking video games but realized I chew or smoke a lot more doing those. Movies not so much. I've been looking into some of the side effects but didn't know about the fatigue part. That explains a lot. I always thought of nicotine as a stress reducer and relaxer but I noticed recently how "ill" I feel after. And you saying just wait out the craving is exceptional. I think I was looking for a easy way, a quick fix. Now I know it's going to be a bitch but fuck it I don't want to have my whole life revolve around when I can get a fix. Tomorrow seems slightly less daunting thanks to you and hatiekolmes. You're awesome
who won then?
Nope. Cannons are defined, if memory serves, as anything 15mm or greater

There's always that one guy that thought this advice was a joke.
You have exactly diagnosed the problem. 
I actually was wondering that myself.
Get a dog if you want to feel safe. Cattle on the Trail are a greater risk than anything. Wait 'til you're crossing a field and have a big ass steer staring you down. A dog is always a welcome companion on the trail and in any camp. A gun  is an aggressive way to say "hello" to hikers you meet, a dog isn't.
No, it's imaginary because only a total of three died in that instance and Dry only killed two. So he's making up two additional people, hence imagining the situation.
What are those? I looked it up and they look similar to cheetos?

I'm 4.7k, I was playing mid against a gyro the other day and he maxed homing missile. I had never encountered such an occurrence before, and so every time he cast it on me I cluelessly ran back almost to my t2, and so I complained to my friend : "Wtf, this shit does 440 damage how is that balanced" and he explained to me that it does more damage the farther you are from cast point and that every time I ran away I was just hurting myself... he's 3.8k. Was really embarrassed.

Yeah but bottoming out is no fun for anyone.

Unless you're flying in WHs, it's almost pointless to fit T2 rigs on a triage Carrier. They're meant to be disposable.

It's not IMPOSSIBLE it's just really, really expensive and bothersome to work on that sort of problem. Damn safety and damn the environment!
Definitely agree. There's so many advantages to it. You can even use it to get that mental edge, or a cs advantage, or even to zone. If they walk back in to lane and you instantly burn them down, they're forced to play a lot more passive, meaning less harass/chance of dying for you, less roaming from them, easier time cs'ing, makes them miss more cs, etc etc etc.  There's just so many advantages to it.

Saving this for when people are sucking Jordan's dick while bashing Lebron for passing so much in the fourth quarter. Huge double choke by Jordan.
Because Orion gets hate everyday for trying to give everyone a better experience.  I bet it would get annoying to the Orion Staff when they have to deal with this toxic and wining community.  And they don't have your RS account info.  They can see how long you play for and use their software from RSBuddy.
Colombia.  I know I sound like a dickhead pointing that out, but I work with somebody who is from Colombia and they get **incredibly** pissy about the spelling of it.   Columbia with a "u" is in the USA, it's where Obama lives or something. 
there's really not much you can do to change it, try to allow this stuff as much thought as is practical to give it in your life, that is to say, if you cant change it, dont dwell on it, better to just concentrate on getting your own life set right before getting worked up about this kind of thing.

Thank you!
The Z2 also has the best battery life though, so it may be worth the trade off. 
Exactly this. It's such a great deal and bundle. I myself can't wait to jump back in Halo 2 on-line and play some good games. All the glitches are still gonna be in so I'm sure I'll spend a good amount of time getting out of all the maps all over again.  Really hyped up for Destiny as well and these two games have sold the console for me. I know it'll be on PS4 but TMC is a big selling point. And you can bet your lucky stars that there'll be a special edition XboxOne for TMC.
Thanks for the yamask and enjoy your shiny :)
If there's anything Johnny Knoxville has, it's gotta be confidence.
Fuck that bro. I gots me a hankerin' for exploited poon. Ain't no satisfaction to be found otherwise my man.
Fantastic, thanks heaps! I'm definitely going to give 310 a go and Nashville is a place i want to get to also.   Can you recommend a good pub where you can strike up a conversation with strangers and play some pool?
This is what we do too. We quietly hold hands and wait, but I keep my eyes open and wink at my daughter when she looks at me during the prayer. It's important to learn to be patient and respectful of people who believe differently than you, but that doesn't mean we have to lead the prayer or anything. 
Not a happy bunny. 
I have had mine for months with no problems and iv been pretty rough with it. I would contact whoever you purchased it from.

Citalopram x 20mg. But I'll say that I believe the actual med doesn't matter because individual results vary; it's trial and error finding one that works.

thanks! appreciate it man

going to have to figure out how to keep your back flat.  it's rounded in your set up, and you never make an effort to straighten it out before pulling.  starting rounded then pulling your lower back into position at the top is a good way to fuck up your discs in your back. check the [so you think you can deadlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS2wLZSdeDg) series - all 7 parts - and start working to correct that rounded back.
And failed miserably! 
My production improved substantially when I dropped all "production" and focused on theory and playing my midi keyboard. I took a basic coursera course on classical harmony which drilled all the basics (plus some more advanced stuff) home, then loaded up my piano sampler instrument and just jammed. I can make stuff I'm pretty happy with when I just play my midi keyboard but I often can't get the same ideas out of my head by trying to click it onto a grid. You can "audition" chords so fast with a keyboard whereas you have to click them into your piano roll if you're solely relying not he grid. Go play with one at guitar center at least, see if it would be helpful.
Whenever I think of Ron Paul 2012, I think of /r/circlejerk. Could you imagine…  &gt;CONCORD, NC — Phil Parsons Racing is proud to announce a new partnership between reddit and a passionate community: /r/circlejerk.   &gt;"With a vivid fan base, we hope that the \#98 team will bring even more fans to watch NASCAR racing every week," said team owner Phil Parsons.  &gt;Along with new fans comes new sponsors, with a crowd-funded effort to help Ron Paul campaign for his 2016 Presidential election. Other sponsors will also be on the 98 car, like Staples, Mountain Dew, Doritos, the hit movie "Getaway," and the Adventurebilt Hat Company, producer of the world's finest fedoras.   &gt;"I'm really grateful of all the attention that our efforts have brought to PPR," Josh Wise said in a recent press conference. "One day while training, I became enlightened by my own intelligence, so I'm really glad that /r/circlejerk chose me." PPR also stated that they would consider changing the team's number from 98 to 69 in order to secure the sponsorship deal.   &gt;"I mean, it's habbening."
Who wasn't in DNS alliance lol. XD  I agree there was a time when EVERY1 wanted the fn cargo hub which I think is what usually ended in the ring map. I &lt;3ed that map in the beginning.   Just from what I saw, didn't matter if you had good gun game and generally a pretty good player all around. If you didn't follow the basic tactics, you weren't asked to play very often. The good games, the close games seemed to always end on who deployed the better tactics. Didn't mean they kept the tactics throughout the entire game, but the deployment of them set up the finish. The last paragraph hurts to read lol, oh the memories. Helping defend pfc before it went into flames and ringing for corps that simply would buy districts. Just to shitbricks a few days later when they were attacked. Brings back the ringing memories. The amount of times I just simply took my headphones off and sat them beside me as I played. Didn't mean anything by asking what corp you were in lol Twas simply curious. 
They passed up Vos?????   "Louie!!! ........ Beans!"

Cool.
1) Stick with it long enough so the cravings go away (it really happens!  Or did for me, anyway.)  2) Don't let yourself get hungry.  The only times carbs and junk food look good to me, now, are when I'm *hungry*. It's a good idea to just keep the sweets away, if you know it's your downfall.  I have been avoiding keto-baking for that very reason - I used to LOVE baking and more importantly *eating* baked goods.  If there was a cake in the kitchen I would eat half of it in a day, "Just one tiny slice!" at a time.
I don't know if they are the same. We should ask Buckley or Valeo.

Sebago Fairhavens are much, much better looking than these. I don't believe they still make em, but you could likely find a pair on ebay. Granted, they aren't a mixed fabric, but I'm not too sure they'd look all that nice in person anyhow.
Oh god, this would be amazing! 
Next time try chopping up some potatoes, turnips and carrots, tossing them in olive oil and salt, and using them as a bed for the chicken. The juices from the chicken drop down and cook the vegetables, it's absolutely amazing.

I'm glad you managed to get some of it back at least!  If your percussion stuff is MIDI you could try exporting that track as a .MID file. Highlight all the regions on the track and do File -&gt; Export -&gt; Selection as MIDI file... then at least all you have to do is set up your software instrument again.  If you have audio in there you could try exporting the project as AAF (File -&gt; Export -&gt; Project as AAF file). AAF is a "cross-platform" project format - think of it as a stripped-down Logic project. You get the audio tracks, region position/length and that's about it. But if your corrupt tracks will play at all, you can load the AAF back into Logic, save it as a Logic project and then try re-importing the corrupt tracks from that.  Failing that you could always just look for the audio file itself, load it into the new project and align by hand.

This is probably gonna get down voted to hell, but I'd blacklist this guy if you've ever used him. And consider him burned and clean house. Yes maybe he had a personal emergency, but anything out of the ordinary, to me constitutes this. You never know especially everything being anonymous. But Id consider him arrested and they are now trying to get his pgp key. Everyone do what you will, but if you're smart you'd stay away from this guy for awhile. 
That looks fantastic, but it also looks like it doesn't ship to Canada. I will definitely look into Canadian vendors, though. Thank you for the hard work. I really do appreciate the time it must have taken to find a deal like this, only to have it wasted by someone who didn't do the research.  Thank you, fowlslegs.
Rate of fire refers to how many rounds it can possibly shoot in a minute (I.E. 650, 900, ect), you're talking about selective fire (burst, semi auto, full auto)
I think it has to be over $1000 to be a felony.  I could be mistaken though.

I'm doing it! However I'll break it if I'm able to make a trip to sephora (I'm two hours away lol and I need to ask for a color match there so I may buy a small thing). I'm also extending no-buy July to clothes, books, plants, and basically anything else that's not a necessity.
I love it when a fighter throws a 1-2 then clinches to stop a potential counter, thats the sweet science right there,  i also love it when a fighter holds the one of the opponent's arms and basically prevents from connecting cleanly, i call that a chess play but what i love most is when a boxer throws pity pats never hurting his oponent and yet he scores throughout the fight, i call that a freaking clinic.
I'm for it, I actually suggested this to weeksly and he said no, him and JL didnt want it haha. But yeah, awesome!

(Disclaimer: I also think most facial/neck tattoos are a bad idea and am also opposed to racists/gruesome tattoos in visible places.)  1. With the expection of a tattoo that might make me believe that I was in for poor service or a rough time, I'm not sure if I could care less if the person serving me or working on my house/car/dog/body has tattoos. it has NO impact on their ability to set my dog's busted leg, inject me with a needed drug or cook a burger. Why would I care about what these people look like so long as they do good work and don't cheat me on the bill? I don't think a tattoo is much different from a fashion choice. The hostess at my favorite restaurant dresses like a cheap escort -- the kind that works in Vegas. But she's nice, polite and always gets me a table a little sooner than she should because I'm a regular. I may not like how she looks, but it really has no impact on her ability to recognize me as a regular customer and get me seated in record time.  2. no comment.  3. Again, how does a tattoo or a whole bunch of them have anything to do with my Manager's ability to make decisions for my department? I mean, if he had oh... some half-fish, half-girl mess on his arm and he wasn't Navy I might have some questions about his ability to make a good decision, but if I otherwise saw no indication of cloudy logic i don't know that a tattoo would necessarily count as one. If he was a total scatterbrain that consistently made bad decisions, then his tattoos might be the result of that, but they alone do not confirm or deny decision-making prowess. Furthermore, tastes vary. My boss might think geisha with swords on both arms is TOTALLY THE MOST AWESOME THING. Whatever.   4. Why is it childish to write a story on your skin? People wear permanent jewelry, they show their scars and they look like they do all the time. How is a tattoo different? Really, there's not much substance to your rant here. HOW is a tattoo childish?  (I get the impression you feel like his decision to get a tattoo is somehow invalidating to your idea of common sense. Trust me, unless it is in direct reaction to you, someone elses' life choice cannot invalidate your own. That's like arguing that my choice to not have kids is a judgement on your decision to have kids, or my desire to not smoke at a party is somehow a judgement on those that do. You can construe it that way, but it's going to make you pretty unhappy.)  Edited: STUPID BULLETS

Ha don't know.  Shes a great girl and well we get along amazingly well.  However I do want to sleep around still. The problem when you find a girl who is pretty much a unicorn.  Suppose its a good problem to have but anyway.  If she was going to trap me she would have done it by now.  I know she wants a kid but she wouldn't trick me to have one. Her morale code is insnaely strong.

I wouldn't feel bad.  Some people here dislike /r/baseball some subscribe to it, we have freedom to do what we want.  Not saying its a free pass and go act like an idiot in /r/baseball , but this is reddit who cares if we have some fun maybe hype up the team.  People aren't going around saying "oh boy those folks at /r/brewers sure are a polite bunch."  If I would have seen that thread I would have predicted a wild card team, but I don't check out /r/baseball much. I also was hyped up and after the Rockies sweep went to /r/milwaukee and posted about the Brewers going to the playoffs and its time for the city to rally behind this great team.

But how is it confirmed? The article on tvline.com just cites it self as the source but did they ask Donald Glover? All it really says is that all the regulars from season 5 will be returning, that doesn't mean Glover can't sign on.

Hi please let me know if OCC Annika and Lime Crime Suedeberry are available =)
So, the idea of prayer with the saints is less controversial than you might think once you understand it.   There is no notion that prayers to god himself cannot be received. In fact. The entire mass can be construed a prayer, and it isn't to Mary.   The idea of praying to saints, is better understood as praying with saints. In the same way you might ask a dedicated church goer in your life to pray for you, so too can you ask a saint in heaven, of which Mary is an obvious choice.
Warm brown. Favourite animal? 
I've been using the Z10 for several months now and recently got a Q10. I skipped the Z30 because I personally find it too big and inconvenient for easy handling and one-handed usage.  I am almost inclined to say to the prospective BlackBerry owners that they can't go wrong with the Z10, but it's mediocre battery life is a big drawback. Heck, it's one of the main reasons why I got the Q10. However, when I swapped the Z10's 1,800mAh default battery to a third-party 4,500mAh battery I found the frankenstein Z10 to be perfect. The Z10 is now a heavily discounted phone that you can get for really good prices, and I think you should give it a try.  Of course, since you're coming from Android and if you're currently using larger devices like the Galaxy S5 or the HTC One, you may find the Z30 a good fit. Frankly I find that there is absolutely no drawbacks to the Z30 other than the larger size.  Hope it helps.
