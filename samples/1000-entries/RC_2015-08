Agree he owes us.  But if it looks likely he *wants* to leave and if we get fair compensation, then why try to influence him?  There's nothing worse than someone staying and playing for a team when their heart is not really in it.

Yeah, it's kinda weird, [especially after just reading this post](http://nwn.blogs.com/nwn/2015/07/second-life-mixed-reality-stalking.html). I can understand the reasoning behind it, but I would keep all interaction inside the dating site and if I felt nervous I would ask to Skype before hand or something.

Not answering does not weaken an argument. It only shows a lack of willingness to answer and nothing else.   It is the duty of the person making the claim to prove it, however when two people start a debate a certain amount of context is assumed to be known by both arguing parties actually have a debate instead of just answer g a million questions. This is a WWW thread not a respect thread and people should be expected to know who they are debating about (at least some basic knowledge), do personal research or be silent.

You clowns should read the article.  "Shooting at aircraft poses a significant safety hazard. An unmanned aircraft hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil charges."

This would not work with the company that I work for or several other large groups as far as I know.   Most rents are set by a third party company that uses market value of the apartment along with historical data as a means to control the rental amounts. We are not able to change the amounts that are given to residents. However, there is a wide fluctuation in pricing based on lease duration. Longest lease is not always the best price.   You're also going to have to worry about state and local law in regards to this. Haggling is a potentially major fair housing issue. This isn't to say that I haven't been told that it's allowed, but of the 100+ properties I've helped at only one property did it.   Edit: To add context to the 100+ communities. I worked for a staffing agency that was specific to apartments. I moved from community to community as was needed. I changed hands so often and so frequently that there were weeks where I would be helping at 5-6 properties at a time.

Good question, it really does depend on my mood. I have so many yoyos that I want to generally play with them all, so I really will flip between 2-3 per day per of how I am feeling.  Example: Yesterday I brought all five of my Yoyo Officer yoyos with me. I played all five throughout the night as I was bored. The day before that? I was throwing a YoyoZeekio Anarchist exclusively. And the day before that? A modded Black hyper-freehand.  So really, its just one of those things where I look at my case, randomly grab one and go from there. However, if I know I will be recording a trick- I will grab a Clyw throw specifically. 
I had the chance to ride them in my friend's S14 and they're pleasant on SOME roads--if you drive in a city with mostly shitty roads, you'll hate your purchase. The high spring rates were valved appropriately and if your car is on the ground with some room for some wheel/shock travel, you'll definitely will be getting the most from these.  The mindset that you want to come into when buying a set is that "my car is going to be purposely low, not super functional, but I'll make the necessary things to make space and/or make these ride decently"  The reason why I say "or" is because not very many people go as far as to modify their suspension bits to accommodate for the really low ride height.  The wheel well factor is really more so for 13's than 14's but either way, making room is always necessary if your goal is to have wide wheels with negative offsets which is right up 326's style. Hard to tell with only your handy dandy butt dyno but these dampers do compress and expand. Give them room to do so and you'll have yourself a OTS-slammed-ready coilover set that will need supporting mods to mate them on a relatively functional purpose.
Gameworks isn't a driver though, and even then it tends to work alright in Nvidia cards

(Casual) I loaded up what I thought was 300 on the bench today, got a spot, and really struggled with it, but was able to get it up without help.  After my set the guy spotting me asked why I was using the 55lb barbell...  I didn't know our gym had 55lb bars, I thought they were all 45lb, so turns out I've been benching 10lb more than I thought and actually did 310 today.  (Serious) the tendons in my elbows, and my wrists are feeling a bit banged up and sore from the bench frequency... any suggestions? (Other than reduced frequency)

I'm a professional archaeologist. I absolutely love my job, but at the end of the day, its exactly that- my job. When I come home from work and decide to dick around on reddit I don't really want it to be a continuation of my work day.

I'd be more worried about them pissing the tarantula off until it flicks hairs in their eyes and then deciding to sue.

&gt;Actually as I type this, I'm sensing that you'll experience one soon, but you're going to ignore it or rationalize it in some way.   Self-fulfilling prophecy. It is inevitable that he will rationalise something very soon, as rationalising is something people do routinely. All it takes is for him to rationalise something slightly odd, or uncanny, and boom, your prediction will have seemed spot on. When of course in reality, you have predicted nothing.   You are not as open to the world as you think you are.

It is kind of self-righteous to donate and have your name associated to it. It's sort of donating the money and screaming "Look at me! Look at me! I donated $X to charity.

I only just recently got a stuttering problem in the game, in the latest update.

I read in your first update that you're applying a lubricant prior to sex and that you refuse to masturbate for religious reasons. Have you considered buying an enhancing gel/cream to apply with your lubricant before sex? These creams are usually pretty cheap and you apply them to sensitive areas (clitoral hood, clitoris itself, labia) and they encourage blood flow to come into the areas and engorge them. Engorged areas feel better when touched, caressed, and penetrated.  If this isn't an option for you, I suggest you seek out a woman in your church who has a marriage you want to emulate and ask her out for coffee. Be honest and tell her what is going on. Have her give you advice. I feel like you're asking Reddit for advice but because we are faceless strangers you do not feel like we really know what your life is like. This woman would. Ask her for help.

Very well! We've discovered that he can really take a lot more than we both though, in terms of CBT and edging. I have him on a very strict daily regimen:  - 35 edges as soon as he wakes up - 15 edges at lunch - 35 when he gets home from work - 50 before he goes to sleep at night  That of course doesn't include the times when I decide I want to use his big cock for my own pleasure, or when I just feel like being mean and adding edges ;-)  He's been kept in the CB-X Curve around the clock since we purchased it (55 days now). The only times he is let out are during his edgings/fuckings, and when I personally clean him. He hasn't touched his cock with his own hand since it was locked up.  We are still going for 100 days minimum, but I very much expect to add another 50 or even 100 to that once we get there.

It's pretty good for seeing how good role players are and how effectively they use their minutes. If a guy is putting up 10/6/3 in 18 minutes, his per 36 numbers would be 20/12/6 which is almost unheard of. And it's not to say that those would be his numbers exactly if given that much time, but it's a good indicator of the fact that said player uses his minutes very well and produces at a high rate.

My favourite routine is to plank 3 times for 30 seconds, with 1 minute's rest between each plank. Then the next workout day do the same but 35 seconds for each plank. Keep going up by 5 seconds every workout until you can do 1 minute each plank. At that point, start again at 30 seconds but add a small amount of weight on your lower back. Keep repeating.

Ledger's portrayal has always given me chills. Try as I might, I fail to see him there at all. I see Bale, I see Oldman, but no Heath Ledger, only the Joker.  Makes you wonder if the role really did scare him so bad knowing the ability to portray someone so evil was within him all along. I can understand the depression now.
Okay n_n I'll be doing it a lot the next few weeks. If you join that forum it would be easy to see when i'm hosting :)

The best overall card is emperor thaurissan and he's in an early wing. I think only warlock gets a good card from the last wings I can't remember though. I just remember thinking I could've just bought like 3 wings and been fine with that. 
Probably Liberland. As far as I know they haven't committed any atrocities yet.

Because she'll no longer be treated as royalty.
We point out that we have already banned sale of arms and munitions to russia and that it is not the fault of the russian people but their tzar that this war has begun. For that reason we do not find it appropriate to embargo materials not relevant to the war.
Im sorry.  If you believe in the adaptable religion, then it wouldn't be able to adapt.

The only other interpretation I could think of was that you have to take some kind of action to transfer energy from the battery to the weapon, sort of analogous to cocking a gun, but it seems unlikely and impractical that you'd have to do that more than once per battery swap.

It would probably be a nice touch. An unexpected twist on the normal scenario of man giving woman a ring. But not necessary.   Ultimately you know him best and know if he'll take it well.
The article you link is ridiculous and misleading. Looking at the state level to determine which political party received the most welfare is meaningless. These "Red States" are not made up of 100% Republicans.

No, but that's the industry standard. Portal 2 is ~8 hours for the campaign yet I've never seen people complain it wasn't worth the $60 they paid for it (although I'm sure some ne'er do wells are going to comment saying that very thing just cause). It's quality, not quantity. 
Really? I've never heard you mention it before on reddit.
* -------First game--------- * Title: Dying World * Type of game: A zombie survival MMO * Where it take place: The entire planet. You randomly spawn somewhere on the planet. If in the same group, you spawn in the same area * Description: Survive! that's the only goal of the game the more it goes on the harder it gets because there is more zombies and less ressources . Don't die or your corpse will become a super-infected and you don't want that because they are extremely hard to kill. The world is reset after 3 real life months   * ------Second game------- * Title: Splinter Cell: Targets * -----Available gamemodes----- * Single player: The Fourth Echelon spies are getting hunted one by one by a new world wide organisation called: Blackwatch. Can Sam Fisher stop this plot before all his allies are dead and Fourth Echelon destroyed? * each times you replay a level the guards &amp; the obstacles ( Lasers, Cameras, Codes etc) are randomly place in the level &amp; the codes are never the same  * Co-op: You maybe killed Michael Harlington (Blackwatch boss) but the remaining cells are still active and dangerous, stop them.  * 4V4 Spies vs Mercs  * Training simulation: play in the community created missions  * map editor: create your own Splinter Cell missions!

Lot of early deaths in wrestling, lots of substance abuse.  They put their bodies through hell in and out of the ring, for sports entertainment. 
It seems like every team has a one-sided rivalry with the Lakers. I think it makes teams even more bitter when you say that.
That is a valid point you have there. I literally hadn't thought about it that way before.
Yes I work in mental health as well. It's not suspect. I wanted to know what the cops thought. We heard what this guy said, saw the video, now I want more information. So I went and found it. It's still bullshit, but I think it's important to know different sides and perspectives of a story. No where in any of my comments did I defend cops. In fact it was quite the contrary. I couldn't have been more clear when I said "I think what they did was shit" 
That's what my dad and stepmom did (mostly because she was pregnant... and meet at a church singles group... Oops) and they've been married about 25 years. Honestly I just really don't want to spend the money on the dang thing. 
Thanks for your response!
Talk to your gynecologist, it could be an issue or you may just need to go on birth control to make it more regular. It's something you should really talk to your doctor about because it'll be an issue with a solution specific to you. 
True, but I think the clear target is Shelli... even a backdoor of Vanessa isn't out of the question. 
Which would be a great idea.
Pretty sure you can use their characters if you dont charge money.
??? Isn't the point of this just to demonstrate that these combos/strings are possible? People aren't just saying "WOWZA LOOK I CAN DOWNTHROW COMBO THIS GUY CHARIZARD NEW OP", they're just saying "here's a little chain you can pull off." They do it against stop CPUs so that lag and other player inputs get in the way. It's not like a montage video of SIQ TREINAN MOAD COMBOZ is making the rounds or anything, they're literally just a demonstration so others can apply it to their gameplay. 90% of competitive smash is labbing and part of that includes fucking around in training mode for a few hours to get the feel of your character before applying what you learned to human opponents.  This is a silly post and I'm honestly surprised Reddit is riding ESAM's dick so hard over this. 
&gt;human/Vulcan hybrid is lame  Have you seen how hot vulcan chicks are?

Great article from Niche Gamer, I didn't realize the data was so old. I was kind of questioning why people were still playing Halo 3, but then again we had people playing Halo 2 on Live until they pulled the plug so it shouldn't surprise me that much.
It's going back on the November 2016 ballot.   San Diego is still working toward the ban, like Encinitas and other cities in the sate.   "The statewide ban prohibits the use of single-use plastic bags at the point of sale at all retail shops with over $2 million in annual sales as well as at all supermarkets."
Normally I have a bad habit of staring at things that I want - like if a friend is eating a delicious-looking pizza, or the crotch of a man I want to jump on.

Legitimate question, where are you getting this data?  This shows the US [much lower](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?order=wbapi_data_value_2012+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;sort=desc) than what you're claiming.

So why does she look at fan reviews and stuff like that if it bothers her so much?  She is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  I mean it'd be one thing if she just wanted to stop using the internet cause she felt like she was losing connectivity with real people.  She seems to be using it as a way to shield herself from the negative opinions of people.  I hate to tell her but that is life.  Not everyone is going to love you.  Especially in her position of being a comedian!  When you put yourself out there and say, "hey look at me Im funny Im funny!" and some people dont agree you are opening yourself up to some degree of rightful criticism.  I just dont understand why she had to stop using the internet all together though.(as I said baby out with the bathwater syndrome)  Its like she is blaming everyone else for her issues with negative feedback rather than dealing with her own insecurities.  Excuse the internet for actually having an opinion!  I guess its kind of pointless to type this cause she will never read it.  Maybe her bf pass it on to her.  /sarcasm 
You need to chill. 
&gt;But then they shouldn't complain, it's their own fault.  The issues might not become obvious until weeks or months later. 
The words mean the same thing though.   "Fuck her right in the pussy" and "Sexual intercourse right inside her vagina" mean the exact same thing. One is just frowned upon for no real reason, other than it can be. It's ludicrous.   Not to mention, we live in a world where Literally and Figuratively can be used interchangeably. Language doesn't make sense at all. We just keep going with it.

I can tell that I will have to do some work on it (of which I have no experience) but you can't beat the price. When I set it down on my porch to take a look at it, there were tons of little plastic pellets that came from the back end and I found that it was missing one of the Styrofoam floats on the side. It will do for now, even if it is a little cramped in there (long legs) 
I'm not a fan of Orkin. But again, thats an opinion.  Do it yourself, save hundreds.

How many people do you have left? You could still probably sneak a trade through if you had a willing partner.
But where were your sources to back up your reply? Where is your research? It's just a discussion. I'm not making policy here.   I believe in social healthcare, and part of what I mentioned was subsidized gym membership. I'm far from some right wing nut bar. I just believe if we're charging people more for motorcycle insurance because it's dangerous, shouldn't unfit people pay a bigger premium too, if they can reasonably become healthy?   I'm not saying charge people for having diabetes. If a health condition is out of their control then that's cruel to punish them for it. I'm saying give them incentive not to get to that point. Give them tax breaks for hitting the gym, and lower their insurance premiums if they stay healthy.   We reward safe driving with lower premiums where I'm from. Why aren't we rewarding healthy behavior?  Or tax shitty food more, maybe? There's no reason we couldn't add a 5% fast food tax. Give Incentive for companies to offer healthy foods, or reduce crappy foods from their menu, and use the tax money to fund health programs in schools.

Not really, no racial riots going on here and no cops that constantly shoot gypsies or turks in the international news because of a questionable approach. We don't blame these minorities for every crime either because for that there would be too few gypsies or turks in our countries. Xenophobia, a clash of different cultures might be an issue, but it's nowhere near as systematical as in the United States.

That seems a good plan, but that kind of transference of personal liability totally much everything up.  After thinking about this, you have to realize: you can't actually control people. And I mean that literally, you can't control their actions, unless perhaps they have a cybernetic radio control implant in their brain. All you can do is offer them incentives to act in certain ways.  So, still use lawsuits and liability to solve it, but instead of piercing through the organization to the individual, apply corrective pressure to the org. Lawsuits for $500m, for example. The idea is to make it impossibly expensive for these organizations to operate in the way that they do.  Put a budgetary burden on the Police Department that is so big that they simply will not be able to operate. This will cause the impossible proverb to happen: shit will roll up hill. The city will be forced to address the issue. Will they simply shutter the police department wholesale? Will the city itself have to unincorporate to pay out the billions it is on the line for? Will the city try to pass off a tax assessment for the payouts to the residents, so much so that they will simply leave, and the city won't exist anymore?  There are cases of rural police stations and forces being totally dissolved and shut down.  The notion of regulating the behavior of each individual officer is an impossible proposition.

From what I understand, credit cards are better for those who do not pay in time. If you fail to pay your credit card in time, sure the interest rate is high, but it's just one month. If you overdraft on your debit card, you get stuck with fees that can be much higher.

Reading through this thread I can say I understand your gripes. They sound like terrible people. No one should be pressured to do anything romantic.  But to exclude a group based on five people?

You can't pull the (ball of) wool over my eyes.
yes! i think i just got it. user inputs 10 as the getint input variable value. you need the loop to run ten times to print a hash and move to the next line. since your input is 10, you need to print a hash and skip to the next line from 0 to 9 or 10 total times. So if instead i set my variable into to row =1 I would have to set up my for loop as for(row = 1; row &lt;= input; row ++) to get the same result. Initially i was thinking the condition should be row ==10, but now i get it. Thank you so much, that was the perfect explanation.

Idk about you, but during Trials and IB i always start trying to sport some different gear, maybe a scout rifle or an auto, then i get smashed by Thorns and i can't do anything else than using mine too. Fuckin boring.

Shortly after the event is over, yes. They're extremely expensive right now, though; I would suggest waiting for a 50% off sale like they've had for the first series of figurines to even consider it, but I'm poor right now so perhaps a little biased.

Vanity. I can't look like a super hero unless I eat clean and lift weights. I started by looking at muscle magazines to find different workouts, narrowed down through trial and error the lifts and styles I like, and stayed consistent. Diet is the worst and most important. Start with limiting/eliminating sugar and drink a ridiculous amount of water.
You also used time manipulation to try to get me to murder my family and my best friend -- then, when I resisted, you made reality break if I didn't at least fake their deaths.  *That was the most disturbing RP I had ever had to go through.*
You shouldn't need it for AP econ but if you can take a derivative, you'll be good.  It helps for all the "marginal" questions (first derivative of a "total" function).

Like I said, 6 years for all 4 consoles so far. At 25 mil after 2 years there is no way it'll reach enough steam to get 125 mil in 4-6 years. Sure, people wait till the end of a console cycle, but not 10 million, let alone 1 million.

If you see someone pick shyv jungle, go fizz jungle. He just shits on her 1v1 with red smite and completely blocks her splitpush. He is also worth a damn in the early game and can gank well. His teamfighting and pick potential are also all way better.
Attracting new players is easy with game related news with big battles and thousands of real life dollars lost (as put by the headlines). The problem is retaining them. Brave is huge in having newbie players than now no longer log in. Once people experience the real hurdle of SP, how mindlessly boring grinding ISK is, the more the game becomes something that no longer resembles a game. Add TiDi on top of that and it's definitely not for everyone.  While EVE is good at being a social MMO where player interaction is a must. I bet a lot of people do not want to rely on other people, especially those first few months. Flying tackle is not for everyone. 
Yes, I think it should

Make sure you touched that creepy skull thing in Amelia's boss room and saw the cutscene there.   So where you should go next is a area in the cathedral ward in that big courtyard area. Looking from Amelia's boss room go to the right of the big courtyard until you find a door. You should be able to open it.   If you need a visual aid here's a video. https://youtu.be/TYMx-91lb9k
Yes, that's not the whole story, but that is indeed a significant component of the story for the majority of Christian theologies, no? It can't be discounted if we're talking about what is and isn't wishful thinking. 
It's a fine line to walk when so many people are worried game development time is being spent on DLC, but I know what you mean.
I mean more his passive play.  He's not slow, but he's also not leaping out into super-advanced positions.  He's a more defensive AWPer, which is completely fine.
This guy has a point but when he starts talking about how the lifeguard is going to start drowning that's when it starts getting ridiculous.  When I was doing my bronze cross (pre-lifeguard courses) we had to do fully clothed swim. On top of that, lifeguards are trained to swim with weight. His claim is pretty stupid.
I didn't say anything negative about the sec. All I said was they are unfairly propped up by circular logic due to espn investment. That isn't their fault. I like sec football.   But if you're gonna try and argue that espn doesn't have a clear and incentivized biased towards them you are fucking blind. Look at the pre season rankings, that should be enough. When the entire sec is ranked preseason and each team plays one decent OOC, they are guaranteed to unfairly benefit just like they do every season. 
This works only on teamers who are so fucking stupid that they can't even team properly. Good teamers are not bothered by shooting viruses, unless you really know what you are doing and have someone who is ready to attack them as soon as you virus them.

When I left, I just knew they were full of BS, that the bible did contain contradictions. I did not dismiss it as entirely as I have now, after coming to the conclusion that the Judeo-Christian god that is all-knowing, all-wise, all-powerful and all-loving is not making a presence in our world. Then I learned what archaeology says about when the various parts were written/edited, and that explains it. I do still believe that some of the sayings attributed to Jesus are worthwhile.

I always play on normal and attempt no kills/no alerts my first run through. Then once I have some unlockables I fuck around and see what kind of chaos I can cause.  That said, I have an idea for a move I want to try out in TPP which I call the "bomb in a box." In the trailers we've seen snake dive out of a box leaving enemies to investigate it. I want to try planting C4/the non-lethal equivalent, walking over it with the box equipped, diving out the side and detonating once the enemies approach.  This game seems like it will be full of neat little experimental tricks like that.

&gt;continue to pay down in order of interest rate  That's what I would do.  &gt;closing a new low balance card will do little to nothing for your credit  As far as credit score goes, closing an account can only hurt you because it will increase your utilization (if you carry a balance on any of them, which you do) and decrease your number of open accounts (more accounts is better for score).  You can not benefit from increased AAoA (as explained above).  If you have significant annual fees or other reasons to close it, there may be a net benefit to you personally even though it won't help your score.

No he doesn't because he never said it.
I experimented with TKD for 6 months, trying different approaches for approx 2 months.  First was 20-30g dexteose pre workout. Mixed results as far as energy, BUT undeniably hit higher intensity in my programming despite not "feeling it".  Then did 20-30g dextrose post workout. Seemed to give me more stable energy levels in general - nice flat "plateau" of energy in and out of gym. Maintained intensity of TKD but felt better.  Finally did 20-30 g dex both pre and post workout (40-60g total workout days). Actually lead me to feeling energy peaks/valleys. I believe too much carbs for me and did not benefit my workouts more than my previous TKD variants.  Overall, found TKD post workout most useful for me. Speaking anecdotally I believe it simply replenished my glycogen more effectively for the NEXT workout and helped with post gym recovery.  I can only speak to my own experiences.   For clarity: this was training as a competing powerlifter, 5 days a week on a GZCL variant of high intensity, undulating volume, 4 week micro cycles.
Thanks for all the information! I'll be sure to use the info when the time comes
My Nmom is like this if we are at a social event together. Except, since she has no clue how to relate to me as a person, her version of inserting herself is more awkward.   She will search me out like a heat-seeking missile and just sort of.. hover or sit next to me in silence. Listen to my conversations with the other person with this odd smirking expression on her face while staring at me. Like she's studying some exotic beast. I've noticed that she will co-opt things I've said during these sessions at later times. So basically, she's observing me for engulfment/passing purposes. I'm sure she thinks she's fooling me, that I'm too stupid to notice (hence the smirk), but I'm hesitant to tell her to go away and look like a jerk. :(

Well when the options are Obama vs McCain I'm obviously not going to vote for the latter because he's a superhawk. Romney does not need any comment, its pretty obvious hes even worst. Money in politics didn't matter because both are establishment. I'm obviously not going to vote for Clinton either, but if she gets the nomination then my vote against money in politics won't matter. Both candidates will be stooges.

&gt; If you place me and a chimpanzee together on a lone island, to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bets on the chimp.  Not convinced about that, put me on a deserted island that isn't tiny and in a few weeks I'll have a shelter, something heavy and sharp tied to a pole and possibly a fire (depending on been able to find the materials), the chimp will probably do ok assuming the island has something it can eat

I've been to Comic Cellar my fair share of times for Magic The Gathering prereleases.  It's a pretty good place to get to know other like-minded people, A lot of my friends say Jason (the owner) is a bit of an ass, which I suppose could be true, but he means well. he's just got an abrasive personality-- once you get past that, he's a solid guy.  an alternate place to go to for DND stuff is Mid-South Hobby and games located on Summer-- I went there for a bit for Board Game Nights and most everyone there is really friendly. H and B used to be solely focused on models and RC, but they've taken to stocking up with MTG, DND and Comic book stuff too-- they also host DND sessions as well.

Oil is a significant factor, but there are also other things that compound the issue. This is what the Bank of Canada says about it in [its last report](http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-summary-2015-07-15.pdf):   &gt; Global growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the United States and China. Recent indicators suggest a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of this year, and growth is expected to be solid through the projection. In contrast, **China is slowing amid an ongoing process of rebalancing to a more sustainable growth path. This has pulled down prices of certain commodities that are important to Canada’s exports.** Financial conditions in major economies remain very accommodative and continue to provide much needed support to economic activity. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the second half of 2015, averaging about 3 per cent for the year, and accelerate to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017.  &gt; The Bank’s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. **The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker-than-expected exports of non-energy commodities and non-commodities**. Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation.

They don't. It's just we couldn't release our kit until the deal with Nike was done. Also, they won't now release all 3 kits at once as it would reduce the amount of sales they will get in comparison to releasing all 3 separately (making hype videos for each etc)

You must have some weird hard on for baby if you're constantly stalking the dude to the point we're you're making a reddit account named after him. Last week a drunk said he was going to shoot me, guess what happened next, he tried punching me and fell on his own face first and was knocked out cold. You don't take drunk people seriously ever.

Have you considered dermal plating instead? You can chrome yourself up, style it however you like, and have room for improvements after chargen, and it's pretty cheap as well. 
There's no good excuse why the police wouldn't have searched the pool right away, but I can understand why the family might not have: they simply didn't know that a body could sink to the bottom.  So they just looked "at" the pool area rather than on the bottom of the pool.  Until just a few years ago (and from reading about cases like this), I didn't know a body would sink like that.  I probably would have looked for a "floater".  If her family wasn't knowledgable about how bodies behave in water, they might not have thought to dive in to the bottom.
Interesting how you are afraid to answer questions about what you believe. Do I frighten you that much? Just with a keystroke or two.

1. Everyone specs differently. I've found contentment with 250 hp. While this might fuck me in open confrontation, it's enough for someone with the ability to apply actual tactics because...  2. No one should be using a bow in a gun fight. It's not an either/or situation. Presently, I carry both a crossbow and a rifle, because I can. Eventually I'll carry both an AR and a compound bow. The bow will be silent, giving me alternative stealth options so I can focus on accuracy with the AR.  I'm glad you have your play style, but don't assume yours (or yourself for that matter) are the best around. This game has massive potential for a myriad of tactics that will change in value depending on the situation at hand.
Hold up, I very much did read the entire article, and my aim was not to criticize an "abuse of science".  Sorry, I'm not that SJW.  The history of psychology being considered a pseudoscience by other sciences is a long one, and not actually my battle or my favorite accusation.  I deeply appreciate psychology and the difficult ground it occupies, and tried to make that clear with my bit about not expecting to have psychology explained in terms of chemistry.  My father in law is a PhD in psychology, and has practiced counseling for decades, and it's difficult ground.  My point is that we do need to be extremely careful in these matters, because people's lives are at risk.  We need to be wary and skeptical of our assumptions.  EG, look at the amount of PTSD and brain damage that happened because of WW2, that went largely misunderstood at the time, in large part because it was so common that people took it for granted that people coming back from war were the way they were.  We can see looking back that it had incalculably vast impact on our society, and we understand something of the root mechanisms now that was not understood at the time.  Now what of religion, and people's behavior within it?  I honestly think that people go slightly crazy when their lives conflict with basic instinctual behavior patterns that are a fundamental part of our species.  I suspect that religion sometimes supplies that conflict, especially when it comes to sexuality and denial of sexuality.  I suspect a lot of the more subtle disorders in the DSM are likewise connected to the society being unsuited to the primate that created it.  It's hard to say.  I think a useful explanatory approach to religion in psychology is to think about it in terms of people believing in and living out a fairy tale fantasy, reacting to their own imaginations, often in complex group delusions full of deeply acting social pressures to fit in.  I think that kind of framework could provide better insight than the approach taken in the article you linked, and that's why I'm particularly skeptical of accepting anything about "spiritual condition".  We might just as easily accept that someone's magical potency is low that day, and that's why they are down, and the only difference is that more people seem to believe the Jesus fairy tale as literally true than those that believe the Harry Potter books.

There is something named after Paul Millsap called the [Millsap Doctrine](http://www.slcdunk.com/2013/1/14/3874850/the-millsap-doctrine-the-downbeat-939) which states that when players are given more minutes they often perform just as good if not better when they play more minutes. Also talked about [here](http://basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=501) and [here](http://www.sbnation.com/2012/11/5/3602834/james-harden-paul-millsap-doctrine-nba-stats-hook)  There are outliers especially with small sample sizes or if someones role on a team drastically changes when they change minutes played but generally the per 36 is pretty good indicator (or at least better than one might think) of how someone would perform if they played more minutes.

For some reason the fact that it literally _just happened_ makes this hit even harder. I heard about Dusty waking up the next day. The fact that it happened _today_ just 5 hours ago makes it so surreal.

They were not protesters. They were rioters.   Which incidentally is a crime.   Last time i checked, if you approach a cop in a threatening manner it is called suicide by cop. Mike Brown committed suicide.   If you are too ignorant to see that well, there's nothing i can do for you except to offer you a great deal on a new helmet, you probably have a use for it already. 
Just wanted to thank you for this write-up and testing.  I've been waiting to get some sort of info on this exact thing.  I bought a new SSD I want to use as my boot drive, but didn't want to mess up my activation from upgrade.  Glad now to see that it will still activate after the switch.

You don't cruise in the left lane no matter how fast you're driving. Left lane is for passing. Right lane is for cruising. Learn to use the fucking road. If it takes three cars passing you on the right to realize you're in the wrong lane, you're driving like a dipshit.
That  game is so popular people love it. I have paid jackpots over 1 million before.   Quite a lengthy process. 
I have a pretty good strat for this on Grounded.  Stealth the first guy with Henry. Stealth the other guy on the ground near the outpost. Molotov the two guys at the light. Nail bomb for 2-3 of the guys as they're moving along the walkway. At the very least, 2 should die, and one should take damage, and 1 pistol shot will kill him. Brick the last guy that jumps down.
That'd be weird but interesting
look at this first: http://iwastesomuchtime.com/on/?i=30021  That's when the dark times started. War was waged between Hogwarts and Middle Earth over land and resources. Hogwarts, being the small group of wizards that it is, call upon its ally Wonderland for help. Wonderland helps to combat the Orcs for land. After that, Sir Topham Hatt of Sodor was assassinated by Ghirahim, who was trying to betray Hyrule because he is evil or something. The trains of Sodor declare war on Hyrule for the assassination of their beloved railway manager. The Hyruleans are confused because nobody of their ranks tried to attack any other foreign lands. Brutal combat begins against Hyrule and Sodor over the misunderstanding of the assassination. In the wake of the chaos, Terabithia builds a bridge to Sodor in order to reconquer some land that was taken in the Train/Ogre wars. Sodor catches the Terabithians before any additional damage could be done and more combat ensues. Overwhelmed by numbers, Sodor calls upon its ally, Wonderland, for assistance. As you may remember, Wonderland is a little busy with Hogwarts, so they agree to help Sodor if Sodor helps them against Middle Earth. Once this deal is closed, the catastrophic World War 27.31 begins. Most of the other nations, like Dinotopia and Lilliput, pick a side of the war. However, the small third-world nation of Where the Wild Things Are decided to remain neutral, knowing that their forces were no match for anybody else. Weeks, months, years go by. The war ends with the utter destruction of all of the lands, with only Where the Wild Things Are remaining. But, wouldn't you know it, the Mushroom Kingdom and Latveria emerge from the ashes to plunder what is left of the fallen nations. Being the kind souls that they are, Where the Wild Things Are decided to oppose the imperialist nations who come forward despite their weak armies, but that's a story for another day.

That's what everyone says, but my opinions differ a lot from the popular ones so it's hard for me to take anyone seriously. 
I can't say I can relate because I'm from a culture that forbids dating regardless of gender. (I had to hide my even having a boyfriend when I was in college; I'm bi, by the way. But my parents think I'm straight.)  But I can say this: Your parents are wrong about saying you're not pretty. You don't have to wear dresses to look good, if they don't make you feel good. The best look on anyone is confidence, and wearing clothes you're not comfortable in is the surest way to hide away that confidence. If you feel like make-up isn't going to enhance your appearance and confidence, don't wear it. If you try it and it turns out you do enjoy make-up, then wear it for yourself, not to please your parents.  And when you're in college, if you have the freedom and money, buy clothes that make you feel beautiful. Whether that involves dresses or jeans or slacks or skirts or whatever, it should be up to *you.* (and in accordance with laws; don't go to class naked obviously) :P  The running theme I see on here is this: **You do you.** And I fully believe in that.

Exactly.  Supposedly one of the big factors in the Phillies taking Harrison, was that they also get the insurance to cover 75% of Harrison's salary.
What specifically gives them the right to use the easiest land path (I believe I read that they pack into trains coming up through Mexico) into the United States and flood the border vs. someone who has a harder time getting here (Africa/Middle-East/Asia?)?

I hate how so many people seem to not like Nine's season when that is the only one I love. It's the only one I've watched multiple times. I tried watching some of both Tennant's and Smith's run and just couldn't get into the show, yet when I went back and watched Eccleston's season, I fell in love with it. I just find Tennant highly overrated, and Nine and Rose are the only Doctor and companion I relate to. 
Cool bass lines. Your melody repeats but isn't repetitive, nice work.

Try playing some short casual games to ease yourself in. I'm told Rocket League is both fun and easy to pick up and put down. A competitive game may also keep you interested. 
It's simple. Low intensity cardio (jogging) is bad. High intensity cardio (sprinting) is great and will help with muscle building. See for yourself - image google marathon runners and then sprinters.  As for ...  &gt;I want to lose weight and gain muscle  ... this will be tricky, it's very hard to have it both at the same time. In order to build muscle you need to eat - you won't build much while on caloric deficit. That's why bodybuilders typically go through 2 phases: bulking (eating a caloric surplus; gaining muscle mass but also some fat) followed by cutting (caloric deficit; losing fat and a bit of muscle, but keeping most of the built muscle mass -&gt; final result being ripped muscular body).  My best advice to you: google "HIIT", that's the magic word you're looking for. And combine it with weight lifting. As for eating decide what's your priority. If you're really fat amp up the hiit part but don't expect big biceps. If you're just overweight and can live with that for the time being, keep eating and hit the gym hard, there will be time for cutting (in that case time your cutting phase for next spring so you get ripped as mofo by summer).

Goddamn.  A full Irish breakfast is one of my favorite things ever.  There's a place near me that *always* forgets something, and it drives me nuts, but it's still great.  A sandwich sounds phenomenal - I like mixing things together anyway, so it's right up my alley.
Nope, sorry should probably have included that in the OP.
Looks good to me. Lots of high carryover exercises. You might want to make one of your DB curls DB hammer curls to have some variation and work your brachialis.  As for the italicized lifts, it's a personal thing but I find it easier to add all lifts with low volume (e.g. 3x10 with lighter weight than needed) and turn it up progressively (e.g. add sets until I have 5x10, then increase the weight) than adding an entire exercise. It's probably a psychological thing though, ymmv.
When I was little I saw a James Bond movie (I think) and a women was naked who had been killed or knocked out and since I never saw a women without clothes on TV before I thought that was the only time you would see titties..... Fucked up I know 
That is a very good point!
Nothing, but fiscal conservatives have been yelling about the sky falling for the past seven years and blaming the debt on Democratic policies. It makes sense to pay down some of it while we have the growth to do so and while maintaining public programs. We could probably afford to scale back our oversized military, while we're at it. There's no need for deficit spending while the economy can afford to pick up the slack, and our highest income earners can definitely afford to contribute more without risking ruin.

&gt; You must have witnessed/observed regular conversation.  Well, sure--but I really don't see how "regular conversation" can sustain long-term friendship, in comparison to this system, where the friends are constantly encouraging each other to participate as often as possible (at least once every two days). I'm no good at lying, and also dislike it--I'd hate to be forced to say some empty phrase like "What's up?" literally dozens or hundreds of times over the course of a relationship with someone when I didn't actually care.  &gt; I mean shit, basically like this  But didn't I just ask a question? "Well, then, how do *you* converse with *your* friends?" And that was in itself precipitated by an observation on your part.  &gt; "Friend Six" is a girl, right? Try not to screw that one up, she's a keeper.  Romance isn't really in my plans, given the limited nature of these friendships (both parties will eventually run out of interesting questions to ask; at 700 \[about 350 each\], I feel we're already pushing the limit)--and she's already involved with someone else anyway. (inb4 beta cuck orbiter) Also, she's busy enough IRL that she doesn't have extra time for non-asynchronous (i.e., normal) communication with me.

This one time, I went on a trip for a couple days and came back home.  Then I saw that I knocked over a can of coke that I must have knocked over while I was leaving or something and it left a puddle on the floor. Not a big deal, I thought. I can just get a rag and wipe it. But as I walked closer to the puddle, I notice something odd. The puddle was wiggling. I thought I was hallucinating because I was tired. Then I took a closer look. It was a swarm of ants covering the entire puddle of coke.

I've let some friends drive my car(and they totally loved it!), but I am not sure about handing over the keys to a strangers and letting them launch it.  There are no Tesla Dealerships in my state(because stupid laws), it is a long drive to the nearest Tesla showroom, and there have been only a few poorly promoted test drive events in the area.   So I definitely think that this could be an opportunity to bring in new customers.

&gt; not sure about the mobo, you need to convince me the extra £ is worth it  Some reviewers managed to break 5GHz with it, it also has pretty good sound.  The 850 is good, but the 840 is outdated and has some issues. Also the Sandisk drives offer great price-performance.  If 7 is cheaper just get 7, I was able to update to 10 from an old Windows 7 disk.
Also wanted to add that they reported the db was hacked.  The hackers could have brought a db-backed site down with a 'drop table' statement or update statement.  The site would then be down and everything about the CSS and images continuing to be loaded from the webserver could still be true.  It could be down for a long time before they complete a "tape" restore.

Having done a fair bit of research into this, it is about time. A similar problem that still exists is the use of metallic nanoparticles in products. The main issue with them is that they can leech metallic ions into the water that can cause a fair bit of damage to the environment. The big problem with both of these products is that they frequently pass through sewage treatment

The G4ME Zero is built off of the HD380 (if I remember correctly). I have the HD280. To disassemble that one, you have to pull off the pads. There is a small philips head screw under the pads that holds everything together.  I expect something similar to be true of the HD380 and thus the G4ME Zero.

Kobe also had a fantastic jumpshot, and strayed away from physicality for of the end of his prime.  I think he'll be similar, but he uses his body in his game far too much to hold up like Kobe did. Don't think he'll be the volume scorer Kobe was at that age. Definitely seeing him become a super efficient 20-22 point facilitator in his old age. Can't wait, will be interesting to see how he relies on his skill.

We have a 2012 JK Unlimited. Bought it new.   So far we've had the TCS and ABS fail, the tailgate arm catch snap (2) and all the plastic hinge covers on the back snap. Oh, and one of the brakes got stuck, ate / ejected the pad, and shot the piston into the rotor. Had to replace the caliper assembly, rotor, and pads. Took a week and a half and about $700. Luckily, we were in the warranty by about 100 miles.   Unluckily, they claimed it was the fault of the bigass tires and refused to pay.

Fellow lady gamer here who's gotten Too Old For This Shit, to the point I nip creepers like this in the bud now (and I too used to have too nice/hard time saying no problems). Not that it sucks any less, or gets any easier to acknowledge.  I want to point out that you spend some time diminishing his behavior which is flat out unacceptable, shitty and creepy. Drop those "kinda"s and "sort of"s. It's a bad habit.  &gt;I do not know if I am in any position to be ruining anyone's lives.  YOU would not be ruining anyone's life by shedding light on someone else's actions. No more so than someone who saw smoke and so pulled the fire alarm.  HE is the responsible party for his own actions, which were hurtful to you, hurtful to her and shitty all around.  &gt;His fiancée had also expressed concerns and anxieties to him regarding me, as I am the only female in this gaming group, and this is very common and has happened to me many times.  This part makes me really mad. He just shat all over lady gamers, women in general, mixed-sex relations and his fiancée's trust. Can't a gal just game with some guys in fucken peace?  Sorry this happened to you.

You are right, if the 'R BACA' text is in all lowercase letters it will look even more minimalist and simpler. [u/04andrew22] (https://www.reddit.com/user/04andrew22), give the all lowercase letter a shot.  One more thing is r/barca currently features one photo in the banner as 'news slider' sort of thing and one photo in the sidebar, what if we remove news slider from the banner and replace the sidebar image with that? What do you think that it'll look?  [Although if we do it then Xavi's photo won't be there anymore and as the new season approaches I'm already feeling a bit gloomy about the fact that Xavi won't play for us anymore. :(]

I had a similar situation happen to me and I told his fiancée right away. My ex and I used to play WoW and there was a couple we really enjoyed spending in-game time with them. We would all Vent chat for hours while raiding. They lived a few states away from us, but we'd always talked about having a guild get-together and invite as many of us as possible.   Once we started getting serious about planning the trip, the guy started acting really inappropriately towards me; telling me that he can't wait to see if I'm as sexy in person as I sound online, that he's excited at the prospect of his fiancée and I "getting together" (we've both slept with women before), that he was going to get a bunch of E so we could 'really party', and a lot of other stuff.   I did a screenshot of the entire conversation and sent it to her right away, then also showed my bf. As far as I know, she dumped him right away because it wasn't the first time.  She needs to know her fiancé is a sleeze.
That's no good. Are you married to Paint Tool Sai? It may have issues - I use Clip Studio Paint with no problem, also ArtRage, Sketchbook Pro, Photoshop... All work with pressure.  Have you tried Krita? It's free, so it might be a good one to try to see if it's your system or the software. Maybe download the free copy of sketchbook as well for the same reason.  Best of luck!

Leveling kits actually take away from "stance" and decrease the trucks footprint for IFS vehicles. Putting a spacer on top of the strut puts the A-Arms at a more extreme angle, effectively moving the wheel towards the inside of the wheel well.

Wow dude, calm down. I'm just saying that statistical averages don't necessarily represent the whole situation. Yes, most people these days lose their virginity in their teens, but it's not uncommon for someone to lose it in their 30s or 40s. No reason to call me a terrorist. 0_o
It's not that it counts as damage you took.  You can only lose ~29% of your HP that you began the stage with before you start losing medals for damage taken.  If you start the stage with half HP you can only lose 29% of that half HP before losing medals.  Basically you have less HP you can lose before you start losing medals.  What /u/oscredwin is saying is that if the game sees you have low HP when you start a stage it locks in those values for the rest of the stage.  Meaning even if you start the stage and die on purpose and revive the game will still make you lose damage taken medals off of your original HP that you entered the stage with.
... Yeah...

You would be correct, there is a reason why most of the geography looks unrealistic. Literately, the bottom right continent was completely destroyed by one of the gods.

Saying "I'm not paying your fine" is vastly different from "I am appealing because I do not think it was justified." Don't intentionally confuse the two.

As far as I know, you can only level it up by gaining experience from any type of source i.e. questing and mob killing. Even though it might seem to level rather slowly, it's really not too bad. I've turned vampire yesterday and am currently up to level 4 by questing (which involves killing). Saying that, I am VR4. Not sure if that makes a huge difference (I think it might, which makes it a bit more difficult to level quickly at level 10).   As for your money problem, I simply quested, looted all the bodies, collected resources (better to deconstruct found gear and use resources to craft for i.e. daily crafting writs, but if you need the money - sell it) and never had any problems concering gold. You could also try out your luck by either gathering as many runes (the blue, red or yellow triangles in the world) as humanly possible and hope for a legendary (Kuta) rune or fish and then 'Use' the fish (right click) for a chance of finding a 'Perfect Roe' (worth around 15k-17k), which will get you your mount in no-time. Once again, this is more of gamble, it could either waste your time or turn out to be very lucrative.  Hope this helps!

The building is really cramped. I can't blame them for making the best use of every inch they've got to enhance the game experience.

I think of this scene every time I see someone fail to signal.  First because he's right; it is absolutely infuriating when someone forgoes such a minuscule effort out of laziness, inconsideration, "time saving," etc.  Second because I find the notion of a hardened action hero extolling the virtues of safe driving in the midst of road rage hilarious.  "I move my finger one inch to use my turn signal. Why are these assholes so lazy they can't move their fingers one measly inch to drive more safely? You wanna know why? Because these rich bastards have to be callous inconsiderate and inconsiderate to make all that money in the first place so when they get on the road, they can't help themselves. They gotta be callous and inconsiderate drivers, too. It's in their nature."

(5D-sensors and 5D-thrusters, two tiny guns dropped, a shield booster dropped). A-rated power distributor for pumping out the hurt while holding up the shields. Still only one AFMU though, but the cargo rack can be replaced with another AFMU.  Maybe I lean towards a lighter combat arsenal than you want, but on a long trip I think I'd want to have cut the weight deeply enough that I know I *really* don't want to cut more, so I won't end up wondering if I could have cut more.

What in your words is the difference between SRS and transgender?  What is SRS.   And they had seizures immediately after taking the hormone treatment.  They are not epileptic afaik.
I watch the Fox Sports Cowboys from my local Anytime Fitness. Sometimes I pretend to workout and walk slowly on the treadmill but most of the time I just don't give a fuck and will sit there on a bench with my "protein shake".
I love wings, beer, AND whiskey
You have the right to be offended! And this is clearly the most offended generation. Banning the word bossy?  Really!? George Orwell called. He wants his dystopia back.﻿
Yeah, he's gotta give up at least 4 or 5 runs tbh
それを無職の俺が知ってどうなるんだよ。
So 2 eggs right?
No, thanks to the author, /u/robertinventor !

Personally, I'd use a high quality airsoft gun. Legal, far less dangerous than a shotgun, and effective enough to get the same job done.
If he wasn't there, the shootout would have gone completely different. He pretty much saved the day there. And the mansion infiltration needed his expertise as well.  Not to mention he's the one who found out all the information about the diamonds, and the questioning of various prostitutes gave them further information on those 'secret parties'. He's also the one who came across Caspere's financial records.  ....and of course he found Caspere's body.  Sure anyone else could have done these things, but they didn't. Paul did.
Of all the comments I ID with this one the most. I'm not a veteran, I grew up in an abusive home and I was bullied at school. I was also gangraped at 4.   Does it get exhausting always being on alert?   Sometimes I can relax if someone else keeps guard. Thats the only time. 
No experience with this, but I would insist that everyone has recent STI screens and are not drug users. 
Following /u/Seakawn post and this context:   a) The Arts and Humanity Research Council is one of the biggest sponsors of research in the UK - are all works which were done due to their sponsorship fake?  b) All this fellow is saying is that some (imho: most if not all) of us like to assume a outsider position when it comes to polticial, social or religious positions. The internet gave this myriads of nutjobs places to find common views and similary spirited people which serves as an encouraging factor to their views.   In some cases (many actually) the argument is reduced to an dogmatic friend/enemy positioning combined with an rethoric which makes it impossible to reconcile.   Take a look around reddit and you will find the opinions that e.g. "the world goverment" is controlled by feminists, templars, illuminati, jews, americans, aliens. Not all of this opinions are true but yet the have some common rethorics and stem from common fears. If we take on 9/11: &gt;“For example take 9/11 conspiracy theorists. Why do they hold onto their conspiracy theory despite the fact that there seems to be overwhelming evidence that it wasn’t an American government conspiracy to bring down the towers?  What if the  answer is simply: Because the story fits the fears and opinions some many hold towards the government?  And while 9/11 conspiracy theories are far more widespread than other conspiracy theories you still fight an uphill battle against public opinion - except when you are in a group which believes in a similar opinion. That's why groups/toughs cluster and  a small group with an extreme believe is bound to hold dogmatic positions.. 
These videos are too easy to win.  I mean, it's quite hard to laugh or smile if your mouth is in a perpetual frown for the entirety of the video.
名前の物をどう作ったの？　うまそうだ
I will definitely attend the next one! And yes, so everyone keeps insisting
I missed you so much. Welcome back.
Fucking get 'im!
Summary of what is relevant for muscle building:   'Supplementation with the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, caused a reduction in serum levels of this growth factor, while the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and histidine, increased IGF-1 levels. Milk contains greater amounts of phenylalanine and lower quantities of isoleucine compared to meat products such as beef and chicken (Sosulski and Imafidon, 1990). The amino acid profile of milk may therefore be more conducive to supporting a rise in circulating IGF-1 levels.'  In other words, dairy protein increases IGF-1 levels but meat doesn't necessarily do so. Availability of IGF-1 promotes skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation because IGF-1 signalling  essentially stops inhibition of the mechanistic target of ramapycin complex 1-neural pathway, which is the body's main regulator of tissue growth from nutrients. In other words, dairy protein might promote muscle tissue growth to a greater extent than meat protein does, relatively to cellular energy (ATP) input.

id let her fart in my dinner TONIGHT
Lol I'm not really in it, I have family that live there so I visit quite frequently and yeah it is weird they moved it, it wasn't much of a move really its literally 4 streets down from the old one.
Cogans at 8:30? 
so the ideea of a mouse outsmarting a cat was not so far fetched 
Thank you,  but my ideas arenonly a conglemerate of better redditors hard work and dedication.
That's the most surreal comment i've read in a while. It's like a dream sequence.
Hell yeah. If you can't feel the rush of air flowing through your hair between the little bit of space between your ACH and head as you slowly plummet back to Earth, only to then take off your helmet, whip your sweat drenched hair luxuriously through the air in slow motion, what's the point of even being airborne? 
Malazan, book of the fallen. Crazy different races. Explosions galore. Magic. Nuff said.
Yeah, we're super fortunate that massive simultaneous mutations don't occur in the real world.  Would be fun to create a version of Plague where you can mutate a given strain into a new disease which gives you a second, simultaneous infection.  Worldwide antivirals would come out more frequently but by the time your root disease has been wiped out, you have 4 more on the go.
Young is totally yawning while shoveling snow off his sidewalk on a cold january morning. 
I get that, but they didn't say that you want haste to 10%. They make it seem like you just want as much mastery and haste as possible

Who even are these people?
this is underway in cebu.  it will.be good for the congestion and commuting public, but i wonder how the hundreds of  jeepney drivers about to lose their livelyhood are going to cope. 
Id say reallly impressive work out of all the troubles London got before the ceremony. Tbh I expected London ceremony to be a joke since all the financial problens
He's the sale manager for Hobie and was on a photo shoot trip for the company
Wait you know this a joke right? Or you messing with him? 
Then I'm not sure what advice to give you apart from stay strong bro...  I really wish I had something for this... I actually feel kinda shit for not being able to help you, but these guys below seem to know what you are going through pretty well &amp; much beter than me. Listen to them and I'm sure you will be ok, I wish you the best of luck&lt;3
I'm excited for more cardbacks that are themed around classes so I can have a separate themed cardback for each deck.
Omg yes please. Finally give me a reason to turn on the radio again after 4 years.
I can get clean in 7 days...but evryone has different metabolisms....if your metabolism is fast enough, you can get clean in a week even smoking every day all day
You probably look like a troll too. 
Oh god I hope so. SOMEONE TELL ME THIS IS SO.
Gordo didn't know it in that one episode of Lizzie Mcguire
Well the GOP have a point, if they liberalise trade licensing there'll be wall to wall black and hispanic barber shops. With them legal, [what are the police to do with their spare time?](http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2010-11-07/health/os-illegal-barbering-arrests-20101107_1_criminal-barbering-licensing-inspections-dave-ogden)

He's fun though.
I'm not going to say you are dead wrong here but:  Marshawn Lynch:  2015 4.5mil base, 4mil prorated 8.5mil cap  2016 9mil base 2.5mil prorated  11.5mil cap  2017 7 mil base 2.5mil prorated 3mil roster 12.5mil cap  Jimmy Graham:   2015 2.9mil base, 5mil roster 8mil cap  2016 8.9mil base 100K workout  9mil cap   2017 7.9mil base 2mil roster 100K workout 10mil cap  Richard Sherman 2015 10mil base 2.2mil prorated  12.2 cap   2016 12.569mil base 2.2mil prorated  14.769 cap  2017 11.431mil base 2.2 prorated   13.361 cap   Michael Bennett:   2015 6mil base, 2mil prorated  8mil cap   2016 4mil base, 2mil prorated, 1mil roster, 7mil cap   2017 6mil base, 2mil prorated, 1.5mil roster, 9.5 cap   These are not those 4, 5, 11, and 14mil 4 year contracts you are thinking of. These number are easily sustainable especially considering the direction the cap has gone and is expected to move in the future.   
Vas-y tard le soir. Dans les environs de 22h00 la température est supportable.
reached your natty limit after 3 yrs? don't think so broham. you look great and all, just saying that is definitely not true.
Yeah, my cable internet ATT UVerse subscription includes cable TV, because it was cheaper than without. We don't even own a TV.   But the weird part is that they insisted on installing the TV line. I knew when purchasing that I wouldn't use the TV, so I asked them not to bother installing it at all. Evidently that's against company policy.
Of course they did. That's why pats fans have been so fucking pissed

Well, since you're playing Dragon Age, I'd say finish that fast and give Inquisition a go, it's very pretty.
You ruined all that free bait!  Gah!

I know the German names, but I never heard someone using it, except for bragging about his knowledge about history.
