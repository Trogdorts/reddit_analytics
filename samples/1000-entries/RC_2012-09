Hmm, if I could go back to April of '85 instead, I'd buy shares of APAGF for an actual price of 3 cents each. They trade for $16ish a share now and may have even split since then.

WHO CAN WRITE THE BEST NANOWRIMO
The fact that there are any TSM fans kinda sicken me...  Love Oddone... Regi should leave the team and just be a manager so they don't lose to people they shouldn't.  All any team needs to do is beat Regi and the team falls apart.  Regi says xspecial is a better mid, let him do it and they can take #1 again
well someone has to make the content for it to be google-able
Understandable! I'm pretty nervous for this game too. We usually play teams like Florida Central Atlantic Southern U for our first game. This is the first time I can remember we're actually playing someone of national notoriety as a season opener. 
Doesn't matter if it was intentional or not, does it?

I was more stressed as a teenager, I think. As I grew up, I developed more independence (so things weren't so out of my control) and I developed healthier and more constructive coping mechanisms.
Chris Owusu and Konrad rueland have both been cut according to NFL. com.  Also, I can't believe they cut Swain. He was a reliable backup.

Your cousins opinion is bad and he/she should feel bad.
The ratio is probably the same (e.g. they both OC 10% of their stock value, etc). You may have to do some research on that, but I haven't really heard any negatives about the 7870 in the hardware channels.   I think they're less discussed because they were previously outside the 'best' price point; since the 670 and 660Ti have released, the 7870 has moved more into the 7850's price range.  For $20 more, the 7870 seems worth it; if the 7850 gets close with OCing, I might consider spending the $20-30 on a model with a better cooler to help with the OCing.

How is it even possible to compare an RPG epic to a platformer?  I would hardly consider it to be "beaten out" by Gex. The author just isn't that much of an RPG fan. Also, its quite easy to argue that it's not one of the best. An RPG with dragons and knights is such a cliched concept to begin with. Gex was original, and still is. even Final Fantasy had ditched that atmosphere by that point for something a little more fresh.  If you're looking for a critical darling that is frequently regarded as one of the best games ever, then FFIX is a much safer bet than the mixed reception Legend of Dragoon got. You'll notice it is also missing from this list. Hence, it seems like the authors goal was a personal best of list.
It's just juvenile to me imho.
I showed this to a couple my friends, made us smile =]]
Less than a second decided the result of this game. If Hotshot's cleaver hit rumble trying to B or if Hotshot hit Rumble before his animation finished, CLG would have won that game since there was no way for gragas to defend the base against Olaf + Sivir. Amazing thinking that the game could have swung the other way based on something so small.
Another, similar option for bi gals: on OKCupid, there is an option to make your profile invisible to straight men, and only women who date women are provided in your match results. This effectively makes OKC a bi/queer/lesbian women's site for you. :)

For getting hair to magically stand up, use two fingers from your free hand and simply pull at the skin, it will get the hair to jump upright. Be certain not to pull the skin tight like a drum (will lead to ingrown hair) but just tight enough... so to speak. Experiment to determine where exactly the fine line lies.  And really, I've never liked, "let the weight of the razor do the cutting," as an explanation. I think it's an over-simplification, and caused me to hold my razor very near the end of the handle to increase the weight at the head (wrong!).  I prefer instead a focus on how much pressure the cap of the razor is making with the skin. Should be none. It should be that very fine threshold of touching the skin and not touching the skin. but definite force is used in the cutting of the hairs.  And if your razor gets that dull that fast, don't have just one razor. TO change blades mid-shave seems like a bummer for sure. IN fact, check out [Bruce on Shavings three razor approach](http://www.bruceonshaving.com/2010/11/15/the-3-razor-shaving-method-revisited/), which would give you a fresh blade for each pass if you like.

I find Sam Harris infuriating for these reasons and more.  He doesn't even attempt to be intellectually honest, let alone rigorous. Instead he uses confabulation and emotive rhetoric to hide the flaws in many of his arguments.  I used to think he was just a bit thick, but I've come to see he has a certain genius. He has taken the techniques of the Evangelical TV preachers and applied them to the church of atheism.  He is a slick salesman who preaches what the choir came to hear, and he does it in that way that makes the audience feel special for belonging to the one true religion. You've got to give him props for having the chutzpah to take such techniques right into the heart of academia and get away with it.
It seems like this is mostly a spirit tokens deck. However, I feel like you are missing out. The great thing about Drogskol Captain is that it gives your creatures hexproof, but that doesn't help much in the case of large amounts of spirit tokens whose main weakness is board-sweepers like Bonfire of the Damned.  I'd recommend just a handful of solid creatures. I personally love Drogskol Reaver with Drogskol Captain . . . together they are invincible. Also, I'm fond of 4 copies of Spectral Rider. But as long as you want tokens, I'd really recommend two copies of Geist-Honored Monk.  Also, you may not like this idea, but my friend runs 4 copies of Divine Favor in his spirit deck. It combos well with Drogskol Reaver, when he has a Reaver on the field, because of the life-gaining. It also helps protect one of his creatures from a board-sweeping Bonfire of the Damned. Also, having creatures with Hexproof eliminates the chance of a two-for-one play by your opponent when you use an aura i.e. when you cast Divine Favor, targeting a Voiceless Spirit you control, your opponent will normally try to Gut Shot the creature, destroying it and causing you to have an illegal target for your aura. However, if you've got a Drogskol Captain on the field, your opponent can't get in a two-for-one play when you cast an aura. My friend originally used a bunch of different Aura Enchantments, but now only uses Divine Favor.

I was biochem too. I could say that it put me at a huge advantage over others within my medschool class. But the thing is, a full semester worth of biochem in almost every undergrad is basically the first three to four weeks, and the basic biochem material is just the intro lectures. Being a biochem major just makes the next week of lectures a bit easier. And that is similar for pretty much every biochem major. If someone was a Health Science, they would have that same advantage for anatomy, or their specific field of study. From everyone I've talked to (UM, MSU, GV, CMU, Eastern, Western, and a scattering of the Liberal Arts schools), they received about the same amount of knowledge due to the actual way med school is (in regards to medical academics, and not graduate academics).

&gt;Passing it as progress is just horseshit.  I think you misunderstood, I don't mean progress in the sense of technology, but progress in terms of power.  Suppose you have a 4 mile climb ahead of you at a 4% grade. When I’m on the road bike, I will tend to simply adjust the gearing to maintain a high cadence. When I’m on the fixed-gear, I cannot adjust the gearing, but I still want to maintain a high cadence, so I will adjust MY POWER OUTPUT.  This literally forces me, my legs and heart to be more powerful.  I don’t succumb to downshifting and pedaling light and fast, not that that's a bad thing (It's a great thing!) but that doesn’t mean I don’t pedal fast on a fixed-gear.  If I could could climb hills while maintaining a fairly high cadence with a gear ratio that is somewhat taller than what I would have chosen on a geared bike, then when I transition to a road bike, I can be absolutely BALLISTIC on those same climbs.  It feels SO, SO easy and there is so much more power on tap if I want to sprint up with monstrous power, because of all the training.  Does that make sense?
I didn't know that it's been posted, I understand that reasoning. However, the fact that it was also posted in conspiracy means nothing when you actually watch the video and see the evidence of bullshit for yourself.

Did you contact people above your leader's head?  Because honestly, this doesn't sound like girl scouts (from someone who's been in the girl scouts, parents drop people off and then leave and it's leaders, presenters, and the girl scouts).  I've never heard of a girl scout troop that was ran in that manner (in fact, this reminds me strongly of the boy scouts).  Either way, the Girl Scouts are a very progressive organization and unless this was really a long time ago (I'm talking about the 80s or earlier), I can't imagine someone giving a fuck about who drops off the child.

I'm not entirely sure how one can reconcile the statement "I'm a Christian" with the denial of the doctrine of original sin. They're pretty much two sides of the same coin, y'know? The fundamental tenet of Christianity is that man has so deeply strayed from God's intent that we cannot redeem ourselves by any means, and that God offered up a perfect soul in sacrifice to wash mankind clean of our original sin. That's kind of the whole story in a nutshell, really. If you deny original sin, then Christ is irrelevant.

some of these comments are wee bit annoying. I was homeschooled and for what its worth I had plenty of social interaction. My parents coordinated with a large group of families that were also homeschooling their kids, many of whom were friends of theirs already from the community. I remember our times together very very fondly. We met perhaps 3-4 times a week, at different houses, a few of the family's farms, or a church sometimes. We went to TONS of field trips together.  All of the children were required to learn a musical instrument. All of the parents played instruments and so they taught all of the children at least one. Many of us learned to play several...Let me tell you something: making music with a lot of people requires a lot of social skills!   Of all the kids I knew that were homeschooled with, I can't think of one that hasn't graduated college now...  Most of our parents sent us to public school for a period of time. The kids were mostly immature assholes, but there were some really nice kids i met in high school as well. I was picked on a lot for being gay in public school and at the Christian private school I attended briefly. The homeschoolers NEVER did that. I can't see how being bullied is an essential skill kids need.

I know the numbers listed put the official increase total average at around .6 million, but those numbers aren't actual representations of how many people are watching the show.  Ratings are taken from Nielson ratings households. How many people are watching season 5 through online sources? How many more through *pirating* online sources? And there's the fact that not every household is a nielson ratings household, so not even all tv viewers are ACTUALLY included in that number.  Still, to say millions is a bit of a stretch. Could be anywhere from the official .6 million number to little over 1, but it's highly unlikely the increase is over 2.

Eh. It was a gradual shift. As a whole, the same northern states that were [contemplating secession just a few decades before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_convention) now found it unthinkable. Check out the Copperheads (Peace Democrats) and Doughfaces. After the war, the idea that you couldn't just secede was pretty solidified—but that didn't mean there weren't many, many people that still wanted to (or wouldn't have minded if another state had). The whole state's rights arguments we still see today is just an extension of that. We slowly have moved more power to the federal government over time, but there are still some people that think the federal government should be near autocratic and other people that think the federal government should only exist for defense and settling disputes between states.

Got me through college when I couldn't watch the game. His voice is golden.
items of the exact same name/type will automatically stack in some cases. When he throws a map 0 into the water it collides with the other map0 and they "combine" this removes the speed they had gained when being pushed by the water, so they stop.  However, if any other item is thrown, they wont combine and the other item continues on towards the lava. This triggers another switch which stops the signal that's heading for the door.   Essentially, no matter what you throw in, the door will want to open, but if you throw in an item that doesn't match what is loaded in the dispenser, a "kill signal" stops the door from opening.   Maps are unique in that they can be copied, but not recreated from scratch.

After I had set myself up to win the lottery (possibly plural), I would set up a system to send 1 letter to the editor of the new york times a year.

Fuck that, dude. That's not truth.  But Mythbusters? That's some real shit. 
I just don't get how that word doesn't inherently favor women. Being completely serious.

Could we not call being sexually adventurous being a dirty slut?  If that is your personal dirty talk, fine.  But on a broader level it is a weirdly judgmental way to talk about women and sex. &gt;That works out well since my SO likes to be dominant in the bedroom. I find myself starting arguments with him so that he will be mean to me during sex.  You need code words to tell him what kind of action you want.  And a safe word.  You seriously should have set up a safe word before any of this started.  &gt;The idea of a threesome and watching him with someone else is also so hot to me, and I would love to try it one day, but I don't think my current insecurities would ever let me :(  Maybe the problem is insecurity, but you should also realize that it is totally normal to have sex fantasies you don't want to act out.  Some things might be better in your imagination and that doesn't make you uptight.  There is nothing wrong with having boundaries in bed.
Thank you.

You're absolutely right. Therefore, single fathers don't actually exist.
I am totally on board! PM the address and I'll send him a card plus some small gifts. I saw you mentioned he likes sweets, specifically sour ones; anything else he might also enjoy? Any DVDs he's been dying to own?
PM sent! Please let me know if you cast them!

I'm going to wager that it is indeed carrier-related as I'm pretty sure there is very, very little standardization across different carriers. Group messaging is almost certainly implemented differently on any carrier that implements it which makes it a pain for support to be added to something like AOSP which is not designed for a particular carrier.

It's interesting to see someone who doesn't realize they are retarded. It's almost cute.
I used to think that the order in which I set the table (we all had the same seat every time) determined the order in which my family members would die. I would stand in the centre of the table and place down father's plate first, and then I (successfully) plopped down my brother's, my mum's, and my own plate, and yelled "WE WILL NEVER DIE".  I was obsessed with the idea of mortality. And I still hate my father.

Okay, I'm the boyfriend. She linked me this thread. After yet a night of her calling me obese, horrible and other names, simply to put me down. This isn't her first reddit thread about how shit I am(however, she has deleted her history after realising it wasn't fair).  Let's start at the beginning shall we? We met through a mutual friend, we started talking. At first I knew nothing about the situation. But slowly(after we had gotten together) I found out more and more. And I've always supported her, the first two years we basically talked at least 7 hours a day, and I did anything and everything for her. Up until just a year ago I found out she had lied about being raped and what not just to make me drop everything I was doing to come home, to talk to her. Something I did, every single time. She kept making things up to get it her way. She has a history of being very manipulative, and she will do ANYTHING to get things her way. Granted, I have fucked up, like this past weekend. I've apologised dearly for it, but she won't quite accept it. Our relationship mostly consist of her calling me in the evening and trashing me, bashing me and throw a shit storm of mental abuse at me. I've been called things and treated ways I've never experienced in my entire life time. She makes it out in this post like she doesn't want to talk to me every day etc. But that's plain and simple bullshit, she will smack down thors fucking hammer at me if I don't pick up the phone, or reply to a text. I feel like I'm constantly monitored and every time I pick up a skype call, or viber call(which is what we use) I'm petrified I will be belittled and made fun of for whatever reason she comes up with at that specific moment. She threatens with suicide when things doesn't go her way. She have also posted dirty picture publicly I've sent her simply because she's angry at me, usually because things didn't go her way.  She has also threatened to send those pictures and logs to my family and friends, and even my boss.  And this isn't the case of your girlfriend feeling bad every once in a while and wants support. Every single day she's upset about something and demand my attention. Either it's her not having lost weight, or her parents being drunk, or generally not happy. She has been diagnosed with Bipolar, so a lot of the the time she's simply just very sad, wants my support, and then take it all out on me. She is very reluctant to get proper treatment. She got lithium at one point, but stopped taking it. It was just this spring she started taking some other pill again(she refuse to tell me what). She has seen a therapist about threes times(which I know of) since june.   Bottomline is that she is in fact, an absolutely lovely girl when she's happy. The best one in the world. And I'm deeply in love with her. But I can't handle this anymore. I'm being torn every single day. Being belittled, humiliated and verbally abused. My self-esteem have gone down so much since I met her and I can't take this anymore. I've been unable to sleep too many nights to even count, just because I'm so sad after what she have said to me and called me. And it's not uncommon that she keeps these things up until 2-3am, when I often have to work the next day, something she doesn't care about.  Imagine talking to your girlfriend on skype, on daily basis, and everytime you say you need to go she starts verbally abusing you. Doesn't matter if it's because you need to get up for work, or hang out with your friends(plenty of times I have friends over and still talk to her for an hour or so and she throws a fit when I say I want to go back to my friends). I can't handle it. You can call me horrible, abusive or immature. I just can't deal with this anymore. It makes me feel so bad.  At first I didn't want to post in this thread, just let it slip, like the other threads she made earlier, since I don't see the point of involving reddit in our relationship problems, no one is probably even interested. But she asked me to post so I'll do it. She's doing this in hope of people justifying how she's acting, and that people will start bashing me.  I've also gone through 2 suicide attempts with her. Talking to her afterwards and trying to make her feel good. But nothing helps, I don't even have the proper education to handle this. But I tried, but 90% of the time I just get shit for it. I honestly feel so bad after one of her bashings that I just want to curl up under my blanket and don't wake up for days. I can't take it anymore. It's just too much.  **TL;DR: Please read it.**  **Edit:** I was very HAPPY when she would be able to study here in my country. However, I said "I don't want you to move here because of me. I want you to move here because you want to study at the uni in question". She flipped and said I didn't want her here, and that's the end of that basically.  **Edit2:** This is just a little percentage of the whole picture regarding things she has done to me and acted towards me.  **Edit3:** When I called her a "selfish fucking cunt" was this weekend when my best friend had gone home with me after a night out, and he was insanely drunk, in fact, he was literally choking on his own vomit. I had to run out(the living room, where he was sleeping) and turn him over, and then wash everything and make sure he was alright. She had been calling me the entire time, but for obvious reasons I couldn't pick up, because I was covered in vomit and taking care of my best friend. When all was done I called her back, and she started arguing with me. *Again*, calling me names and saying I didn't care about her, despite explaining the situation, so I snapped and called her that. It was in no way justified, but I was just really stressed over what had just happened and the fact that my best friend which I've known since I was toddler was very close to dying that night. I had just washed all the vomit off me and made sure he slept okay.  **Edit4:** Just got off another skypecall with her. She said it was supposed to be the "last bedtime call". it was 1 and a half hour of abuse and concluded with her telling me she was gonna report me for raping her(which I haven't done) and making my life completely shit och several other levels.
So, she's not the most fertile woman, but we still know she puts out. Is she married now?

You do realize the trillions in debt, the downgraded credit and the economic collapse were either directly caused by the Republicans or happened on their watch, right?  Bush created the debt by lowering taxes and increasing spending, Bush spent more money than Obama did. The Republican congress held the debt ceiling hostage (if you declare your intention not to pay your bills, it's no wonder your credit rating gets lowered). The bad economy was caused by the Republican drive for deregulation of the financial markets, like Glass-Steagall.  EDIT: Oh lawdie, dey do hate da facts hea! Downvoted!

i have seen several posts like this on reddit, however i feel like i should tell you guys that this is not what happens all the time. Some russian guy somehow got my origin password and took my account. He changed the password and the email linked to the account. I was able to contact EA support in this manner and after about 10 minutes of conversation i had my account back and he had linked my email to my account once again. It took about 15 minutes of waiting to get in the chat with them though.

Devil's advocate x2  Isn't NYC, one of the biggest tourist destinations in the world and an extremely densely populated area, going to have a shitload more people carrying cameras than the Pentagon?
Interesting question. I'll play devil's advocate here--don't you think the persecution would go down? If tomorrow it became a choice, then yes, I agree with the others. The religious right would be in even more of a frenzy.   But if it would have always been a choice, much more than 5-8% of the population would engage in homosexual relationships. People would alternate relationships between men and women over the years just because they were capable of it. The line between friends and lovers would blur a little, because people could just start dating either sex. That's how I'd think of it at least.
You, on the other hand, contributed nothing by pointing that out.

Haha, definitely. This is probably the result of an acid trip where "the earth was like..play doh, maaan. Like play doh."
It took my friend an entire year to take my advice and leave her abusive on-again-off-again boyfriend and quit smoking.  She'd call me crying at least 4 times a month (sometimes they'd make it more than a week without braking up, but it was rare) and I always knew when she got back together with him because she would ignore me when I tried to get in touch with her because he didn't like me and she didn't want to create waves.  She is FINALLY done with this douche, it's only been 2 weeks but she's never been able to go an entire day without talking to him (even when they were broken up, she was constantly defending herself via text while he called her a lying cheating cunt for catching him cheating on her, and would bring up relationships she had before they got together).  The smoking thing was just an extra way to keep her from being irritable when she had to go 15 minutes without a cigarette, even if it means a few weeks of being irritable about quitting.  It's only been a couple weeks of giving up both of these toxic circumstances in her life, and she's already a lot happier.  She's saved over $60 in 2 weeks, and has gone 2 weeks without crying herself to sleep or being called a cunt.  She's not as tense, we can talk and spend time together without her sobbing about what a mess her life is and how much she just hates everything and can't stand where she's at.  Even when she plays with her kid she just seems to enjoy herself more.  She's just happy now, it's a nice change, and it sucks it took hero long to leave this asshole, but she left a lot sooner than a lot of women do, and she's still able to get her life back on track.
As "schmaltzy" as it was, I found it quite enjoyable. Heavy handed? Sure. But that's the charm of it. For a movie with a central theme about the love of filmmaking, I thought the level of cheesy was quite appropriate.   And I apologize for "offending" you, however much that actually was. 
Also, study real-world history. Charisma is what separates Leaders from the population, including the Leader's followers.  In reality, Charisma is no dump stat- it's the fucking God stat.  (Literally, if you know the root of the word.)  Those that have it routinely do better in life than everyone else, and those also wise and educated become ridiculously powerful- for good and ill alike.  RPGs need to treat this better all around.
Ohshitohshitohshit. I'll look when I get home! Thanks!!

For whatever reason, my mom never learned how to speak English. She's from Puerto Rico and moved to the states as a teenager but never bothered to learn. I was the youngest of 4 (who only spoke English) and my dad spoke English so when I was about 5 I was convinced that my mom knew English and was trying to trick me. As a 5 year old I thought "who doesn't speak English?! There's no way she doesn't speak English". Kept me in check for a while though cuz I thought she was spying on me.

replies from [another complaint thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/yotbt/this_is_getting_ridiculous_dont_you_think_comic/)  &gt;What **you** want to see is not the same that what **everyone else** wants to see.  &gt; &gt;I love seeing Fanart, Wallpapers. I dislike seeing e-sport news. Yet I think they both should be in this Subreddit.   &gt;Honestly I'm getting tired of all these "I'm tired of seeing fanart/funny videos/skin ideas/et) they should make a subreddit for that!!" comments and threads.  &gt; &gt;It's /r/leagueoflegends, it should have all League of Legends content, regardless of you or anyone else wants to see or not!   ----------------------------------------------------  &gt;Just downvote and use the hide button to bring out more content. Shouldn't be that much of an issue. If so many people don't want it to be on the front page, they should start downvoting because it seems most people just ignore them instead of doing something about it.  ----------------------------------------------------  &gt;Too many LoL Subreddits IMO. Keep it all in one place. If its good it will make it to the top.   ----------------------------------------------------  &gt;If you look at the sidebar you'll see there is a subreddit for every sort of LoL related content. I honestly can't think of any content that would fit in this main subreddit anymore if everyone were to use other subreddits.  &gt;Anyway the point of Reddit is so people can see everything in one place, the same goes for big subreddits like this. If you don't like content and think it belongs elsewhere: downvote it.
Awww! Thank you!!
I bet this 4th album dispute is over 99 songs. Victory doesn't probably consider that as a legit record. 
This map has some really interesting ideas, but its just terrible for PUBs as it just turns into a static D competition. 5 tcns and the rest heavys is pretty common.  It has no place on the PUB rotation and should be removed. Especially since the map rotation is starting to get larger more time should be focused on the quality maps.

I know there are good cops out there. I just live in a small town where not much happens, so cops get a raging hard on at a car with a turn signal out. If I get caught, that sucks.

Um, he/she is partially correct.  The Separation of Church and State was intended to prevent the Government from coming in and saying "Good news everyone, we're making a National religion so you're all Catholics/Protestants/Baptists/Etc now.  Oh you don't want to be that, well off to jail/the gallows for you then.".  It was never intended to keep religion out of government affairs in terms of not allowing invocations or prayers before meetings.

This post and the comments here seem to me to be very symbolic of what I have observed of American politics in general. Here is a five page article detailing Romney's utter abandonment of any kind of morals, ethics or human decency in the relentless pursuit of profit (not even profit for his investors, just profit for himself and his ilk) by saddling other people with debt, then having the gall to run for President on the evils of debt. And all you guys can talk about is one throw away paragraph about the fucking Winter Olympics.  Here is the point. Here is you missing it.

Because something funny should come out of this!
Get out.
Just look at the rest of people in this thread.  You have the least vulgar language in your post history, by a wide margin, but even so, it's there.  But it's not just lack of vulgarities.  They lack any rounding of character, any realistic hints of a life outside of their posts.  Your profile FEELS human, theirs feel like cardboard cutouts.  Vulgarity is the easiest cue to point to, but it's not alone... it's really a lack of strong emotion.  As if they take a half hour to reconsider before each post.  And although that may be possible for a normal account, it's pretty unlikely for all ten
You have to step out of your agenda and view this objectively. Playing piano have certain similarities to playing starcraft, but we are in a situation where men are dominating women as of now... Now I'm with you that it's a lot about practice (10000h+ and you can be one of the best in the world at any sport, weeding out most of natural talent by far), but nor am I hellbent on an assertion that there are no genetic differences.   You really have to have an open mind here.
Gun crime is on the decline, even though gun laws have become less strict nationwide...

Singing. I've always been good at it, and at this point can sing operatically quite well. It's a lovely feeling to sing and see someone's eyes grow wide with disbelief as you do. It's also a lot of fun to do in my free time.
Thank you eon! This is exactly the type of feedback I was looking for.  I know I swing outside in, but after really looking for it on the videos of my swing, it is REALLY outside in/over the top. I'll work on that.  Also, I never realized how "handsy and army's" I was until you pointed it out. I'll work on this as well!  That Shawn Clement video is great. It's amazing how well he explains and illustrates what he's teaching; I'll definitely keep that in mind as well.
That picture of the dude with the duck lips was so retarded I couldn't read the article and I love reading articles.  
The idea that marijuana is banned *mainly* because of the power of the rope industry not wanting people to make hemp at home. Proof that pot does make some people stupid.

That seems to be the most common Mobo recommended, I assume it is pretty solid!  The 7950 is worth the extra $80? At NCIX the price is $215 vs $320

My understanding is that FIOS isn't available in Georgetown yet -- or least in the east village. Is it being rolled out here?
Brine chicken in it, 4-6 hours depending on size. Cook chicken whichever way you'd like. While cooking, pour self a shot of whiskey. Take shot and chase with pickle juice. I swear by both.
Watch your blood pressure.
Agreed. It always seems to be a struggle between east and west, with the NC holding the north quite comfortably.

I got banned from /r/lgbt for basically saying lgbt folk can be assholes too. That's going to sooner or later heavily impede dialogue in askgsm, just as it already does in r/lgbt.
If I was worried about people judging me and not liking me because of my #, I'd have stopped at about 35 guys ago (assuming 5-10 is a 'good' number). But I'm definitely in the judge zone now so why stop? I'm not fucking random people 5 times a day. If I want to have sex, then I'll have sex. We're all grown ups, so do what you want but just be safe about it!
Don't focus on learning in the classical sense. Just build some stuff outside your comfort zone. Invent your own problems, then research and engineer solutions to them. That's how you stave off feeling old.
&gt;and in order to get people to vote you need to get them excited about a candidate by highlighting the differences.  Maybe. But i find that all it ends up doing is dumbing the public debate down into false dichotomies that bury the enormous similarities and play up superficial and imagined differences.  &gt;The ACA was only watered down as a concession to the GOP   Actually, that isnt true at all. The Dems had more than a year to pass it with a majority that required not one Republican yea. It's exactly that sort of omission in perspective that I am trying to highlight.

I guess that is true. I don't even live at home anymore, so it's not like she'd every catch me in the act. I guess it's one of those things that I'd like to get off my chest just to clear the air, not really for any other pressing reason though. Anyway, thanks! This definitely helped!
I have a BS in Business, a BS in Economics, and an MBA. I was the president of a public, hi-tech corporation. My experience is that most recruiters do not know the difference between a BS in Business with a major in Finance and a BS in Finance. My undergraduate diploma says “Bachelor of Science with Honor” from the Business department and my transcript states only “BUSINESS/ECONOMICS.” In twenty years only one or two companies have actually asked to see my diploma and/or transcript.
1.2 voltage really isn't that high. Try pushing it to 1.22 or so at .005 intervals until it's stable. As long as you don't go past 1.4V you're fine.
Maybe I should have been more clear too, I said what I said cos I think it's great that there is a whole, specified movement just for men in this particular topic.

Yeah, I know.   I believe there has been some research trying to figure out if the fear that women experience from rape is a contributing factor... that is, if because they're so terrified all their sense are heightened and thus they orgasm easier. This is completely unproven, though, and I imagine it will remain so, because it's hard to test something like that concretely. 
LoL 
DotA 2 has awesome tools to accommodate viewers and casters that are vastly superior to LoL, I definitely agree, but I honestly think LoL doesn't need them.   They have the playerbase (the largest in the world), it's growing and expanding (especially in foreign countries, for instance I've heard that its grew to be much more popular than Starcraft 2 in South Korea), and despite lacking the tools of DotA 2, it still has the bare minimums to rake in *tons* of viewers. They don't need much more than a stream and some commentators to keep coming and coming.  And what exactly do you mean that the only tournaments are Riot-run? There are tons of other tournaments I've heard of that go on for much smaller prizes for up and coming teams, and a lot of tournaments now being hosted by the sponsors TSM, Curse, etc.) to show off their teams and garner new fans. I'm pretty sure LoL has more going on in non-Riot-run tournaments than DotA 2 does with Valve-less ones.  I'm still saying the major thing in this battle will be its playerbase. LoL is just a much easier game to get into and will be more fun for the majority of people who play it. Yes, there will be more people who are not interested in the competitive side compared to DotA players who are, but they will still be larger in numbers. The game is simply too big and I see no reason why a much more hardcore game will be able to surpass it given the backings Riot does for LoL's eSport's scene (all the free publicity, *the salaries players will earn next season*, the streams embedded right on the launcher, and all the other good stuff going on).
Exact same thing with almost ALL soda machines. When I worked at a food joint I cleaned the soda machine for the first time, maybe ever? It was HORRIFYING and as long as I worked there I cleaned thoroughly it at LEAST weekly. Now I'm super conscious of it and check every soda machine I come across and they are NASTY. 
Me either, but considering he's already huffing it back in from a big plastic bag, I don't think that's an issue for him. I also doubt it's a high priority if you're that low on trees in the first place.

In my opinion sniper is not worthwhile on MVM. You'll do more consistent damage as a 2nd soldier or demoman. It is fun though, I'll give you that.   The worst is when I play with snipers who aren't even capable of making as many head-shots as you made. That is when its time to publicly shame, and possibly vote-kick said sniper.

Dude, you're not exclusive by any means. Fuck the harem of hot foreign chicks. My fucking god. The relationship will be there when you get back. And it'll still be good - it's new for chrissake.  Here's what the feminist majority of this subreddit will tell you though: Stay celibate for HALF A FUCKING YEAR during your wild vacation because you once held hands with a girl and talked to her for a few weeks. Oh, and keep her updated about each and every conversation you have with other girls during your trip. And exchange Facebook passwords with her. And when the Lebanese models ask you to join them in their group shower, tuck your penis between your legs, close your eyes, and repeat your chastity vows. It's not like you're in the exact prime of your life, during which you possess a sexual attractiveness that will never again be matched in the entirety of your existence.

You can definitely overdose. Just because it doesn't kill you doesn't mean that it's not an overdose. A weed overdose, in my opinion, is when you get higher than you'd like to be and you start freaking out.

  I personally think it's an awesome idea and agree that the NYT reporter is putting a needlessly negative slant on this. 
that isn't how alcohol works. Wine and Vodka are both Ethanol. you didn't drink half a bottle of wine, which is a hell of a lot weaker then (15%) but somehow drink 40 oz of vodka (35%) and get drunker off the wine. you are an idiot, and have a warped sense of what you drank.

A holy shit indeed, Jesus. 
I knew I wasn't the only one who had trypophobia
The courts' preference for placing children with the mother is a holdover of a late 19th century legal principle--the Tender Years doctrine. This doctrine started with the UK's Custody of Infants Act in 1839, which was passed in reaction to a divorce case where a violent ex-husband was given custody as it was actually more usual for men to receive custody than for women. Though this was seen as a progressive move, it ultimately reinforced Victorian social norms, and served as an expression of the Cult of Domesticity, which elevated women so long as they upheld four cardinal virtues--piety, purity, submission, and domesticity. It identified the home as women's sphere while the outside world was left to men. Such gender roles of course failed to recognize the individuality of either men or women, and society would be better served by tossing all vestiges of such restrictive, sexist thinking out the window.
While I don't disagree with your sentiments, saying "no offense" doesn't make your offensive statement less offensive.  You're using words that trigger anger by calling them retarded, that's offensive.  Adding "no offense" has never helped any statement, ever.
Yeah I did. Was more than a few years back though, wasn't it? Here it is : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKIcqPB1Q1E
I could do it. I am ok, though I didnt play on the reddit bronies server. I usually topscore on pf2 and I am recently playing PUGs as scout. My steam ID is Equineox and has Twilightlicious as the avatar if you want to check out my crap I have for the scout
It's been hinted at that I have aspergers or some type of autism spectrum disorder by professionals but the tests are too expensive.  I score incredibly high on the tests these people take so I'm pretty sure I am on the spectrum.  That being said, rocking and biting your nails is just one of a number of things.  It pisses me off if people try to get attention when they are not even close to the hell I go through.  When I was with my ex girlfriend the stress of having to be with someone all of the time and yelled at when I needed space caused me to meltdown.  When that happens I cannot speak or move correctly.  I live in a nightmare of looping thoughts in my head and every one of my senses get so sharp that it hurts.  It really hurts.  And it can last for days until the conflict is over.  When a pattern I'm in is broke it triggers it.  I've found ways to deal with it but I really don't like people taking it lightly.  
I have been giving serious thought to speaking to an Attourney. I am about 80% sure that I will see one next week or so.

I should have been more specific. RBMs are good at capturing high-level correlations (e.g. "these 30 pixels tend to have the same value as one another."). They're not so good at dealing with pairwise correlations, which is why people usually run some kind of whitening process like ICA on the raw data first. . 
Interesting. I could see that being adjusted to work really well with dual monitors.
I think it's a bit of a false dichotomy to say that if you want a romantic relationship with someone, then your friendship with that person is illegitimate and derived exclusively from ulterior motives.  It's kind of a straw man, because I don't know of a single person like that, on reddit or elsewhere.

No, it is not. I use Gentoo on my Desktop and Mandriva on my Laptop. I have BT on a virtualbox for when I do some small jobs (i.e. I am currently doing a simple risk assessment and backup for a local property management company). Most of the work I have done deals with Networking/Juniper so I am not a pentester and because of that I like to have BT around since all the tools are there, and when I am done I can just remove it.

It's not really a conspiracy theory and shouldn't have been posted there in the first place. The point is, bullshit happened... and that point is made regardless of subreddit.

true but there is a difference between someone who is religious and the stereotype that Texas gets blasted with.

Here is something I have done successfully to help with this feeling: close your eyes, concentrate, and imagine that you are fifty years old. Imagine that your body is older, your clothes are different, you perhaps have a spouse, children. Let it really sink in. Then, think about yourself now, your life now, as if it's a memory. And when you do, ask yourself, do I have any regrets? Do I wish I had done things differently?  When you open your eyes, write down your regrets. You now have a to-do list for right now. And as a side bonus, it feels like a miracle has happened. You've traveled back in time and been given a second chance! :-)

I don't have an issue with going against conventional storytelling. However, letting Pell live is not going away from conventional. It is violating the very story he built. For what reason would Oda give Pell such poetic lines before the bomb exploded? Just look at how well put together that whole sequence is. It was the perfect way to go out.  Also, I don't need to hear his explanation as to why he did it in order to deem it a bad decision. There really aren't many justifications, and all of them are poor.  You're right, it is Vivi's story. But it is also about how the straw hats influenced Vivi. Luffy tried to force her to understand that to make that commitment, people would die. In fact, this same theme is portrayed with the death of [Spoiler](/s "Ace.") To allow Pell to live after he willingly sacrifices himself for the country is a violation of one of the most important themes displayed in the Alabasta arc.  To attack your point that Oda cares for his characters, I would argue that killing a character off does not mean the creator cares less for their characters. It means that they sometimes understand that it is for the greater good for the story. George R.R. Martin said in an interview that it pains him every time to have to kill a character in ASOIAF. Just as I'm sure it hurt Oda to kill off [Spoiler](/s "Ace.")
Well I'm kind of implying that they're just as ugly on the outside as they are the outside. I mean you could have outer beauty have an ugly heart - or vice versa. And I can see If I dislike someone that doesn't mean everyone else should. It's just when I see girls and they're just complete jerks to the guy I just wonder why they're still with them.
But that would probably still kinda boring after some time. Shooters ususally are fun in teams because the gameplay is so dynamic and you can have countless tactical approaches.  In a 1v1 the outcome would probably always similar with guys always sitting at the good spot etc.  Also many people would not like to play it because they know that their aim isn't the best and that would be about the only important skill in such a game.

This is a pretty fascinating thread. From what I've gathered so far there's a lot of reference to crunch and noise. I think we need to dig deeper, and then think about how to create the sounds from there.  Here's how I play this out in my head, kind of from a different angle. There is a mysterious person that  sits down next to you, you could know them or you could not know them, doesn't matter. They are someone that you feel strangely attracted to but know not the reason why. They move up close to you to whisper in your ear, and you can see their mouth in your mind, and you can feel them very close to you, closer than people get. They start whispering into your ear. Slowly saying words. The words don't matter. What matters is the proximity, the reality, the atmosphere. Everything is so far away, except for this whisper. You can hear every little nuance in the voice, you can hear the stranger's life force. And then your brain suddenly feels like it is submersed in champagne.  I believe it is a proximity affect, a feeling of being closer than is possible in prescribed reality. I think it is anticipation, and being thrown into a situation that is closer than you would normally feel comfortable in. I don't think there is a specific sound alone that is going to do it, but the right sounds at the right proximity in the right order will get you in the right directions. Background noise is also key in my opinion, to create the juxtaposition of the subject sound. The background noise is expected to be quiet, and then you have a sound in the foreground that is normally supposed to be quiet, but is very crystal clear and loud creating the illusion of proximity. Maybe if you can get that proximity effect to trick the listener into thinking that sound is so close it is resonating from inside their brain, you could achieve your targeted ASMR response.
Sounds awesome. :P Make them look as ridiculous as they are is always useful!

Well the game can already be very frustrating for first time players, so losing in PvP obviously would induce anger too. At least that happens to me. :D  Not because I can't stand losing, but because I only go human (at least untill I complete the game once) when I want to summon someone for a boss, and invasions tend to come before I get there. If I lose, too bad, humanity wasted. :(

I have used Titanium Backup and I couldn't wish for it to be any easier or more simple. I just press backup, flash the ROM and press restore and they are all back, with data.
I'm in Canada and this was my process:  * Make an offer on the house. The offer is for a specific price, say 90k, but is also subject to specific conditions. Standard conditions will include that it passes inspection and that I'm able to get financing. There will also be a closing date and possession date. Closing date is a deadline of when I remove the conditions and possession date is when I will take over the home. These are all negotiable by the seller. If your financing is pre-approved, you don't have to include the financing condition, although it's good to keep if possible. * Seller can make a counter offer and adjust price or conditions. Most likely it's all about price unless they have specific dates they need. If you are flexible on dates, then gives you some room to negotiate. * When both sides agree, that's when you organize the home inspection, start looking for a lawyer/notary/conveyancer and let your bank know. * You have until the closing date before finalizing and putting a deposit down (this is different from down payment, but will be included). * Your lawyer/conveyancer will calculate the amount owing between all the parties. Other considerations will be like property tax, which the seller may have already paid for the year, so you have to pay your portion of it for the remainder of the year (or the other way around if it isn't paid).   If you haven't done so already, get a realtor to help you out. Find a good one that can look out for you and guide you through the process. As a buyer, there shouldn't be a cost to you. Realtor fees are paid by the seller (at least in Canada). Be wary if the seller's realtor wants to represent you; they will likely not have your interest in mind. You do not want to get screwed on a purchase like this.
You could say that kind of thing about any celebrity who does an AMA. Obama's made the claim it was him. Either you falsify that or you don't really have anything to say.
Yes, he will probably pay for it, regardless. But what do you think is going through *his* mind in those seconds immediately after the realization?
Well on the positive side that is a very nice picture of a screw. 
Just curious? I don't care either way.

Time for the big post from me:  I can see many people are enthusiastic and also interested in a tertiary-tiered document targeting individuals at **ALL** skill levels and this seems like an extremely useful idea. This subreddit has 17,340 users with different backgrounds into social engineering, but, we all have one thing in common; the interest of knowing what goes on in social interaction, be it to try get into a hotel room for free, steal a credit card, or wipe somebody's iCloud system. We are a group of:  * Newcomers * People who welcome learning * Individuals who struggle with social interaction * Professionals at social engineering who use it almost daily in their lives  This would be incredible if we got the moderators of this subreddit to review this thread, or the outcome we'll produce from it; it has infinite potential, it will hold an abundance of information, and it would be a gigantic short-cut as opposed to just reading it ourselves (I'm lazy; sorry).  Firstly, an important part of the absolute introduction to social engineering is the first place is to initiate and maintain social interaction. Ask ourselves, "How can I approach somebody and not be awkward or give an awkward response?". The content that is written in the Kindergarten stage of SE School should **prepare** individuals with skills and mindsets that should be exercised. Some very basic information that definitely must be included would be, for example:  * Appearance * Reasoning for initiating conversation * The Approach * Practising in the mirror * How to small talk * Do's and **DO NOT'S**  Note that this does not cover all the immediate basics, but from that list, we can see the general picture of Kindergarten. Reminders that you must identify skills and methods that have successful results and keep them, while stripping the fat (unfavourable decisions) out. Also, somebody willing to make positive social interactions must accept that others are different, and take no offence when a strategy of social engineering doesn't work on everybody.  I will be posting more, I'd like feedback on what I should include or elaborate on, or even what isn't necessary and should be removed anyway. Mad respect to ChristianBMartone if he's willing to go through with this.  TL;DR, you are now uncomfortably aware of the flavor of your teeth.
I wish it would have been a blast.

&gt;Sadly I do not have the athleticism to fully utilize my bikes capability  That seems to make a lot of people quite angry (if online forums are any indication) but I have no hate for someone like yourself.  Having a passion for mountain biking doesn't automatically create enough time for me to stay in peak shape or ride as much as I would like, so when I do get to ride why would I want to put up with a junky bike and why wouldn't I want to get the most enjoyment out of that time.  It's not like we buy nice bikes without already having the passion and then hang them on the wall for 10 years.  Ride on!
I'm thinking they must have been pissing her off before that.
You realize that you're posting this in /atheism, right?  You're preaching to the choir!

270,543 In 2004 355,419 In 2008 139,404 In 2012  How exactly do we only have just over 39% of the voters from 2008?  They said those voter laws would prevent the voter fraud. Well with the number of voter fraud they have reported, it surely is meant to harm the Democrat voting population, which in my books, if you have to cheat to get where you are, then that is just disgraceful.
We've killed plenty of people in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen to more than equal 9/11. Killing bin Laden was a useless gesture - bin Laden was one man, just like Mao was one man and Pol Pot was one man. What made bin Laden anathema to America was something else - Islamist anger against America comes from a specific place that is *precisely* rooted in American violence against Muslim countries. Bin Laden himself pointed out that he wasn't targeting Sweden. Continuing that pattern hardly seems to me to be a great success. A superficial, "manly" one, perhaps. But if you're interested in chest-thumping, stick to some empty sports rivalry, please. I'd rather not have my international policy discussions dominated by that kind of dick-waving.

Even if Toph is able to detect Iroh while he's in flight, I think the Korra finale clearly showed how mobile he is while flying. Sure, Toph might be able to pinpoint his location via her hearing, but can she be fast enough to strike him down? Also, IRL, lightning, especially if it's going to be used in close quarters, is LOUD, so it could fuck with her hearing, but I don't know how lightning mechanics work in the Avatar world, since apparently Amon can take one point blank and still get up. All in all, really close fight, if Iroh wants to stand any chance, he'll have to end the fight in the air. As soon as he's on the ground, he's toast.

 First off, I'm so sorry you came to reddit for help and downvoted by a bunch of douchbags. Second, mr jeffy is right down blame yourself it's not you fault. Maybe you should talk to a counselor or go to a support group. Wish the best of luck to you and those around you.

It's not like they push you into the deep end. They at least give you a 'how to swim' manual first. Quoting a recent blog post: "[Google] also recommended another post by Steve Yegge where he covers some styles of questions that are likely to be asked. Yegge recommends a particular book very highly – The Algorithm Design Manual." - http://www.alexbowe.com/failing-at-google-interviews .  It seems that if you can indeed master something extremely quickly then you should be able to master that recommended reading very quickly, and the lack of CS background would not be a big factor. Indeed, if you can then say "I learned about binary trees the other week when I was preparing for this interview" provide real evidence to them that your claim is based in reality. 
I'm literally so excited that you answered my questions.  I tried to find the sponge bob image regarding Obama's AMA to replace it with "I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW, TODAY I SPOKE WITH PEIH-GEE". Thank you!
I disagree with this.  I find that reddit (typically) has more valuable discussions, especially in discussion-based subs like /r/AskReddit and /r/philosophy.  /r/AdviceAnimals and /r/funny are still quite similar to 4chan in the comments.  Pretty much the main reason that I prefer reddit is the more mature and valuable theme of its discussions.  I still enjoy 4chan on occasion.
I've had the experience of setting up about 100 hyper v hosts in the last 3 years, including several multinode clusters.  The current 4 core limitation is becoming very frustrating as application requirements are increasing. Network drivers have been a thorn occasionally (broadcom) and there are several hotfixes (hyperv, clustering,iscsi) that continue to accumulate.  That said, it is very solid on average and performance is good.  We typically deploy the full os because of third party integration we require.  Vcenter seems overly complex for average cases, and overly expensive.  I have contemplated moving towards VMware again now that they are dropping their ridiculous ram licensing, but I will probably see how 2012 shapes up first.

My favorite:  Q: "Why doesn't water run off the Earth?"  A: There is a vast "ice wall" that keeps the water where it is. This explains why you can find a vast plane of ice as you travel southward. The wall is roughly 150ft high. In the McIntyre model, however, the height of the wall increases further as one moves toward the edge of the world.

Aspergers isn't an adult-onset condition, and it doesn't sound like Alzheimer's. It sounds like it's either another neurological condition, or you don't have all the information to know everything that's going on at home.

This avoids confusion when the pronoun may refer to several subjects. E.g. "Bob and Dick looked at Bob's house" vs. "Bob and Dick looked at his house" vs. "Bob and Dick looked at Mike's house", etc. Clarity is important. Remembering a minor apostrophe rule shouldn't be a big deal.

You guys need to realize, that only an extremely small minority has actually played the game in beta, and thus WvW is completely new to them. They don't have any clue what to do, or how it works, the game has only been out on official release for 4 days. So if you want people to be better at WvW, start teaching people the mechanics in chat.

Not me but one of my best friends storys.   When he was in high school he went on a road trip with his parents and his girlfriend. Later into the night his girlfriend starts giving him a handy in the backseat while his parents were in the front. I'm not really sure why they didn't have any contingency plans but he ends up cumming upwards and onto the back of his dads hair.  Supposedly no one found out. He told me freshman year of college and I never let him live it down.

Hey there Future Marine Biology Student,  Just so you know, anyone who works in this field has been in your shoes. I am currently a data editor for the observer program for the National Marine Fisheries Service. If you are looking for field work and you are interested in fisheries, I highly recommend working as a Fisheries Observer. This was the path I took after my graduating with my bachelors. I spent over 2 years at sea working alongside commercial fishermen gathering data pertaining to the catch size, composition, biological species sampling, and interactions with fish, shark, bird, mammal, and sea turtle species. It is a hard job with a very demanding schedule, but I found it very rewarding. If you want to test your sea legs you should look into this. Pay for this job typically ranges from 35K on up depending on which coast you work and how much time you are willing to spend at sea.  Of course the field of fisheries is not for everyone in the field of marine sciences. If you need a job and are looking to sea how the people originally became curious about the marine sciences, observing is an interesting gig.

Meh, his jokes aren't much better than the kind of drivel you can find on sickipedia.  He thrives mostly on being controversial and attracting the kind of idiots who laugh at jokes because they're "politically incorrect", regardless of whether they are *actuallly funny* or not.
TL;DR: "We hate you for trying too hard and we especially hate you for not trying harder."  Wow ... just wow.  Nothing like reading one of these threads to feel justified in every sexist thing I've ever said about women. You aren't women, you aren't even ladies. It's an insult to children to call you girls ... You're blind, ignorant, fickle little liars and I pity any poor bastard who would waste his time on your stuck-up, boring ass.  I honestly don't want to speak to another woman ever again ...  Fucking die, all of you.  Unless you psychotic fucking bitches somehow get a fucking clue, seek out a fucking therapist and work out the neuroses in your thick fucking skulls then kindly stay far the fuck away from anything human, male, lesbian or others  ...   No, I'm afraid cats are your fodder now.  GET HELP!

There goes the neighborhood

&gt; If something this serious was true, you'd find out soon enough.  We're in a thread about a woman who was married to a child porn distributor for over five years.  It's sad that I have to point this out to you.
Clearly you are expected to buy him one; lest their present be given in vain.

PTP is completely closed as far as invites though: am I wrong?
Disneyland. We were in our early 20s and had a great time.  For our 15th anniversary we went sans kids to Disney World.
It's pretty bad for his age. I'm younger than the OP and had a "wtf is wrong with you" reaction.   I agree that picking on each other occasionally and arguments are going to happen no matter what the ages or how well they get along. However, when a kid has gotten to a point where he's writing in school assignments that he wishes his brother didn't exist it's gotten pretty bad. Sure, the older brother is probably having a blast, but it doesn't seem the young one is. 
I get this ALL THE TIME, you have no idea. I am constantly being told to smile, my friends often embrace me out of the blue. I have kind of.. big sad eyes I guess. This all became even more compounded when I became best friend's with a *really* beautiful girl who, if you don't know her, has a horrid case of bitch face. First year of university we were often  told (jokingly... I think) that we looked like we were in some sort of abusive lesbian relationship.
the coffee mates in the top left actually look good upside down, with the cup of coffee showing!
when I watch stupid shit, I think its being really really clever, like all the shitty cliches are meta. where normally im like "thats obvious whats going to happen" when I am stoned its like everything was well foreshadowed and I am so clever for getting it.
Excellent!
I also attribute the spike to Netflix. I started watching when season 4 made it to Netflix, and so did at least 4 other people I know.
Nah, you're just a bit misguided. Hopefully all goes well tonight and you see why I said what I did. :)
Who is keeping track of balls/strikes/outs? Clint Eastwood?   Edit: GODDAMN IT MAN THERE IS ONE OUT!
Yes.
Even if we debunk it, the debunking will be an elaborate forgery.  No matter how much science may show us the way, we will legally mandate that all projections for ocean levels rising must be kept to the growth rates of the last few years.  The FSM created the universe, thus planets look like meatballs, and showing the trajectory of a planet is one of his noodly appendages.  Vaginas!  Now let's talk about the budget.  /rant.
No. How can you be *this* naive?
Nice clean up, not exactly sure how you got past the enemy to grab that tank though.
None of those things has helped people to obtain jobs or increased economic activity much. So we could do those things all day without economic results and live as we have been and be happy? What has been done to help the joblessness to decrease to historically average levels in this country or are we to expect to eventually be happy by settling for historic European Union unemployment levels? I can very much imagine this author, Michael Tomasky, to be happy with that.  Accomplishing sidebar events that accomplish little in economic activity while people suffer as they are doing does little to make me happy.
Let's be friends! I have a kitchen amongst other rooms in this 1 bedroom apt!

But where are the statistics behind this? Where are the statistics that show that this is actually more effective than other methods of job searching?
&gt; Bigotry and racism are opposites.  Say what?  [Webster's](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bigot?show=0&amp;t=1346457008) definition of bigot is the following:  &gt; a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially : one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a **racial** or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance   Seems to me the two tend to go together rather well like peanut butter and jelly. In fact, I think that it'd be rather hard to be racist and *not* be a bigot as well.  &gt; Racism is like a swiss canton and bigotry like two guy scrabbling around in the mud drunk or stoned and trying to brain each other with rocks.  Dude, I seriously think you need to learn what a [canton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantons_of_Switzerland) is. Hint: it's much like states are to the USA. I fail to see how that has anything to do with race.  While for your second comparison, yeah, bigoted people might do something that dumb, but the comparison there doesn't particularly fit the definition much at all. Heck, for that matter, someone doesn't need to be stupid to be a bigot.  In any case, your analogies suck at this point.  &gt; Naturally those whose lives suffer from the most bigotry whether it emerges more on it's own or or projected onto them and their personality (especially the south obviously) are going to be the ones who are more likely to be crying out for the opposite of bigotry. The rest is detail.  Again, I seriously doubt that you really know what the words you're using really mean. See above.  &gt; These people have proved repeatedly to be no more bigoted in theory than east asians, blacks, old money east coast families are etc. black flight is to the south and that's where most interracial marriages happen.But even that type of thing can traumatize lives.  And now you're just being plain ol' racist.
If you tried to sell 1 million, Canadian 1 dollar bills, the market would flood very quickly to the point where they would only be worth 1 dollar again.
Well, at this point we can assume Oscar Klefbom is going to be making bank as well. That said, I think Oilers management is better at managing contracts than they let on. See: Petry and Smyth contracts. I see Gagner either emerging or taking a pay cut, Hemsky either getting traded or taking a pay cut, Horcoff is definitely taking a pay cut, Whitney is probably going to take a pay cut, Smid will probably take a hometown discount, Dubnyk is either going to be a bargain or he's not going to be our starter.  I have confidence.
It depends. I can complete a field contact card with your information which would store your info as well as the reason for filling the card out in a departmental database. It's only for our department though. If I don't then your info will just be chillin in my notepad until it's time to get a new one.
[Here's mine.](http://i.imgur.com/MtFdS.jpg)  I changed all the furniture and added a bolt release and an ambi mag release. The combination of bolt hold open and bolt release make this thing a breeze to reload. Which I am thankful for since I'm in Canada, hence the pin in the mag(and 19" barrel).  The mags probably aren't as solid as Pmags, but they're solid enough for the Czech military. And lighter than AK mags.  I highly recommend this gun.

I love everything about this subreddit, and it is truly a great community.  The logo on the left looks great, but I don't love how it fades into solid orange.  I just think something else could be done with it.  I am in no way saying it looks bad, just that it could be improved.   This is definitely one of my favorite subreddits though.

I'm pretty damn foul, but good god woman, NO! Smell the stain! 
Personally, I wouldn't say mine is obsessive; my gaming area has a lot of collectibles from different games as decor. Like OP's girlfriend, I also put together a Chell cosplay, which is part of why I have the Companion Cube, Aperture tank top, Long Fall Boot socks, and a nifty orange jumpsuit. The Turret was a Christmas gift from my boyfriend, and it keeps my consoles safe from other test subjects.   Now, my love for Legend of Zelda... I admit I would call that obsessive.

done and done :) thanks! In my head, if Azula is bending blue downvotes instead of fire, it's more like Azula invaded and is a part of Snoo's universe, not the other way around.
This may be the reason why my friends are disappointed and why I might not enjoy the game as much as I'm hoping too. There should be some great stuff to do outside of raids and the world needs to feel lively enough (with small fire skirmishes here and there along with the big stuff) for me to enjoy my playtime that isn't a huge raid on a base.   Maybe this is because there are not enough players per server so far to make it feel more populated?
Well I have it in my firewall and I have tried with anti virus and firewall off still the same.

They're making people give a written apology and promise to delete exploited itmes, if not they get banned again, and that's second guessing themselves?  That's laughing in their face.

Minor critique: some first words in the lines, you've capitalized.  Others, you have not.  If this isn't a stylistic choice, then you should go back and make them uniform.
CoH still has the best character creation of any game I ever played. I don't remember much of the created story I had for Palthiron of Gondor, my LOTRO character who I've played since its release five years ago, but I still clearly remember Definitelynot Analien, the ~~advance scout for the invasion fleet~~ perfectly normal meatbag weakling who went to hyoo-man ~~indoctrination camps~~ schools since he was a wriggling maggot prior to his adult ~~metamorphic chrysalis phase~~ coming of age.
Not. Enough. Sauce. 
I played some games on low elo and my god, if you can't carry yourself out of there you're doing something wrong. Just pick the biggest carry your team allows you to play and melt faces(irelia, kass, ahri, tryndamere etc)
I'm so glad your not buying this game. We don't want you.
Amazing! You are in the flow...

Yeah, I think there was a picture on the front page before for unrelated reasons.  I'd love to see a chronicle of your trip once you're through with it - I'd love to do something similar in a few years. Hope it helped!

I was on a college tour recently and there were two home schooled kids (twins) in the group. They were very very awkward in a setting where they barely had to talk.   When question time came up they asked if kids are required to eat in dining halls and if they could eat together in their dorm. I felt so bad for them.
Michael Palardy is a fucking joke.
I absolutely love it! I think this is within the rules; Snoo is depicted as himself and not as a Firebender or Avatar.   I really can't think of any negatives about this. I like what you're doing with the arrows; their directions represent the nature of fire. If you were to involve arrows into Azula's lightning, ensure they're jagged and resemble lightning. Once you get some more detail into Azula and add a background/other characters, this should be amazing.
Claire giggles, not minding the ghost's awkward hug in the least "Oh yes you are. Have you ever 'seen' a wailord?! They're so big!!" She releases her hug and stretches her arms out as wide as she can manage.
Ooh man, you ve got me really afraid now, I really hope I won't become a stranger to my six year old sister now that I'm moving out to go to university in a city quite far away from home. I'm now thinking about getting a webcam for the family pc so we can skype. May I ask how often you go/are home? I'm planning to go home on saturdays and then go back to my place on sundays.

Came back because I had one more thought, which albinus just covered: Catharsis. Find what helps, and do it. Exercise, engage, do stuff that doesn't require a lot of thinking. I have also found that while grieving having sex with a trusted lover or friend is somehow life-affirming and connecting.
What has search overload done to you?
So... you opt-in to whatever Society has to offer. The high prices in the mess tent = availability of 'adult' content. The soldiers didn't consider law changes to regulate the prices.  Or, the Corporal didn't ban Tapioca because he didn't like the taste, even though the soldiers liked it.  We can both talk shit.
Why not the liberals? They are conservatives; their leader, John-James Charest was a federal Tory leader, and they have adopted a lot of pro-business policies, as well as increased the debt (by a third), as dictated by the usual conservative policy of lowering taxes.

New socks. I don't wash my sheets too often, and I honestly don't feel when they're dirty unless it's really bad. Socks, however, I can feel the difference between fresh, new socks and old, worn out socks. And brand new knee socks right after shaving just feels magnificent. It's so worth the effort of maintaining smooth legs.
It makes me sad this link didn't do better
There is nothing in HIPAA that prevents records from being released to a parent with joint legal and physical custody.  One, I've researched it.  Two, I have dealt enough with HIPAA to know what I can and can't say. (I graduated recently with a degree in a healthcare field).  As far as my kids being allergic to something or whatever?  I know.  It's not like I just have the legal definition of joint physical and legal custody...I have the custody for a reason - I see them and take care of them 3-4 days a week, every week.

Disney Cast Members are ridiculously amazing. Last year, in September, we went on the Happiest Haunts Tour at Disneyland. Our tour guide was Allison, and she was _awesome_! The tour group was a lovely group of people, and even though we were the first group on the very first day, Allison had it DOWN! She was very friendly, funny, and genuine. She interacted with each of us individually, got to know us all, and really made it an amazing 3 hours. Each of us wrote emails to Disneyland to proclaim her the best tour guide ever. We're going again this year! (I sorta hope we get her again too!)
Gmail will also deliver to the abc123 account messages for abc123+foo@gmail.com, where foo can be anything.
Sending one person to ninja stables was a good idea since there would be at most 1 (sometimes none) guarding it right at the start. You'd get the jump on the guard if you came from the water and then ninja it before it turned.
The truth is that she actually was pregnant and had an abortion after you freaked.
how do you manage up there in the summer with the bugs. Holy god they are terrible...

There are a shitload of unemployed people who could be put to work on this if the task was undertaken with Manhattan Project or Apollo Program type backing. Other than that, nuclear certainly can move naturally at a rapid space if the public wasn't so against it and we could come to a nuclear storage/processing solution.

I hope this doesn't get buried, but I have a question that really interests me. What was the transition from normal life to a jail environment like? Did you have to change your mindset to a "tougher" one? You seem like you were a pretty average guy, who simply found himself in a set of very tragic circumstances. All of the glimpses the public gets into prisons, like "Lock up," show hardened criminals, and make jail life seem like it is one of day to day survival. They make it seem as though you have to be tough and aggressive just to survive. I may be completely ignorant, but this is my understanding of prison. You don't have the background of the other criminals nor the malicious intent many of them have held. I can understand the transition of being a criminal on the street to being an inmate, but an average who ends up in prison? I couldn't imagine what that would be like.  I feel as an average dude, if I made some honest mistakes, then landed  in prison I would completely fucked, and wouldn't survive very long.
Indeed what are a few billion deaths and raging wars.  Surely people will hunker down somewhere and scratch out a living.  Carry on, carry on.
Any word yet on names opening up from GW1?

&gt;Women are closer physically with each other.  Rubbish. Watch male teammates interact in *any* sport, even stupid casual "sports" like beer pong, or fights outside of clubs or what have you. Just because men aren't cuddling each other doesn't mean they're less physically close to each other than women.
He's just just not into you unfortunately. He likes to string you along for him to feel needed for an ego boost. When he finds someone else he will be gone. You don't need him in your life cut your losses and stop letting him play with your head

Reddit approves because of the hive mind's utter desperation to appear as veteran users of a site that has no members or way to prove vet status.

I have a feeling that you won't have a hard time finding one.  I'd say my dream girl would be one who is intelligent, has a good sense of humor, and can 2v2 with me in SC2 :P
So what if I grow up and decide that I don't like circumcision?  But, there we go, you snipped my little foreskin when I was little. So fuck you for that, because I didn't have a saying in that matter.  Don't take every decision for your child. Let him think for himself. Stop thinking YOU own his life.  If the child will want his willy circumcised, he will do it. If not, it's not your right to make that decision for you.
I would like to nominate Rosalind Franklin. She was the first to observe the double-helical structure of DNA, and made enormous contributions to the structure of DNA via crystallography.

You're probably thinking of Shabbat (which is also pronounced "Shabbos," depends on cultural background). Shabbat is the Jewish sabbath, celebrated from Friday at sundown to Saturday at sundown every week. Shabbat is considered a day of rest, so for orthodox Jews, that means no working (obviously), no driving, no handling money, no use of electronics, no making fires (e.g. cooking), and a bunch of other things.   TL;DR: Jews have a shitload of holidays. And they pretty much all suck for Jews and are awesome for anyone who gets work off because of them (Purim is the only exception).
I thought the same, but then I realized that it would probably be downvoted for lack of content.
they're giving you a chance to make the ban temporary, what in the fuck are you complaining about? 
This is even better, because it gets worse.
Wow I've always wanted to see your collection.  That's amazing
I actually agree with the point of the Joystiq article if only in that the satire will be lost on the majority of the audience, so it "failed".  Not that it isn't present, or that nobody at all can appreciate it, just that it failed in this instance, considering most of the gaming demographic.
Bet you can't comment from it to this...  anyway, what did with mine... got a box of feed paper and put it in the hallway for taking notes or guest comments... but there are still 900 pages left in the box... guess I need more guests.

Not the OP, but my guess is that mothers are perceived as the nurturers and the only ones *really* capable of taking care of children, while fathers are perceived as the "back up" parent whose primary function is to take care of whatever tasks the mother risks delegating to him. It all boils down  to the idea that only mothers are competent at child rearing.

One thing I've seen MC do is take about 10-12 probes ( you'll have 15-16 if you chrono good when the kings head to your base) and move them to your ramp.

As an occultist I regularly take part in rituals, more specifically what is called a 'Banishing Ritual'. A banishing ritual is a ritual performed to banish all negative energy/spirits/thoughts (pick one that suits you :P) so that you have a clear mind for performing Magick and nothing interferes with it.  However, I think rituals take advantage of the power of belief. All rituals do is fix your mind to doing something that holds meaning, so you believe you are actually achieving something. And boy does it work.

Sounds corny, but that my athletic career was completely over.  Playing sports got me through the shitty foster care system, through high school being well below poverty, through college and well was my rock as I started a my normal career.  It was the one thing I could go to and make friends, have fun and make my mark.  I kept at it into my mid 30s, but then the injuries started to pile up and I went from being 'the fastest guy on the field', to 'a fast guy', to 'the old guy with a few quicks', to simply too gimpy to play at all in a matter of a year. Yeah, sounds corny even to type, but when you've had something in your life that has brought you peace through the most troubling times in your life and it's suddenly gone for you there is a deep sense of loss, regardless of whatever that thing might have been.

&gt;As one of those libertarian scumbags you speak of, it's not that we don't value fairness and equality,  yeah actually. yeah it is.  libertarians start from the unsupported premise "all governments are evil" and instead of doing stuff like exercising your democratic rights in a free society to work to create government that isn't evil, or hold government to account, your solution is "destroy all government."  then there's the obsession with government waste, corruption and inefficiency (usually while pushing free market principles and ignoring the fact that corporations can be just as corrupt, wasteful and inefficient as governments, and in many cases far worse,) which leads to libertarians wanting to essentially throw the baby out with the bathwater. who cares that millions of people were prevented from starving to death on the street and given a hand up when they lost their jobs by the welfare system? there might be some corruption and some people might be exploiting the system and we can't have that!  the two areas where government corruption can have serious and dangerous consequences - police and the military - is usually the only government libertarians support. yep, they ignore the fact that a corrupt welfare system might mean a bunch of unscrupulous people get welfare when they don't need it, but a corrupt military *kills people*, sometimes a lot of people.  in general, libertarianism works really well if you are wealthy and don't need to worry about your future. it's a pretty dumb idea if you are poor and face uncertain future employment.

Be patient about the idea of changing the name. Only that issue. The others I agree need to be fought for. '   Edit: Look at it in the idea of importance, which is more important to fight for? Changing the name of a group, and then regaining publicity, or solving some of the more important issues, and then worrying about names?

It doesnt matter where customer support is located. When management dictates that the script must be followed, often for liability reasons, the scripts will be followed. The location of the workers is unrelated to this situation. Domestic call centers would be just as hamstrung as foreign centers.

**Have a demo.** I can't stress this enough. Nothing will make a better impression on people than being able to play your game (assuming it's good, of course). It will help to set you apart from the crowd and people will be much more likely to hit that thumbs up for you if they enjoyed it. A demo shows that you're serious about the development and have something that actually works, and no picture or video can convey that as well as a demo can.  Now, I'm not saying that if you don't have a demo, you shouldn't bother submitting, but a demo is certainly important if you want your foray into Greenlight to be successful; you need to be set apart from the crowd of mobile/Flash ports, troll submissions, and just generally crappy games.

I live in the UK and had this shirt shipped over. Hadn't seen anyone else wearing it until I bumped into a guy at the climbing gym wearing it. For the rest of the night we were the laughing stock if the gym and I met loads of new people that day. Great shirt.

So is that it? Is this over now? Have we definitely not signed him? I'd like to get some food in my stomach.   It's not that I'm hungry, I just need to eat away my feelings.
I do in fact think you are wrong. I have met very many black people that don't think they have enough intellectual capability to do most things in life. No one really says this to outsiders from what I can see. I'm not even an insider anymore, but I'm close enough to observe. The idea that selling drugs, playing basketball, or becoming an artist are the only routes to success is not an abnormal thought process among black youth. At least for men. It's interesting, but I *have* seen more black females who expect better of themselves, than men.
Somebody call jeb! We need to get this in the game!
You are right to be offended. Harass the hell out of that organization until they list 'father' right after mother.
As I said to the other dude- you're totally right. The way it makes noise depends on how you fly it. Only one of the pilots in the UK doesn't fly it in that manner...  It's a beautiful machine to watch fly- there's a lot of physical presence and mostly reminiscence. 
No, I was more thinking how unnecesssary your stereotype was of the "bitter, man-hating, ugly, fat lesbians" who frequent the subreddit.
That is exactly what I'm talking about. Apple used to be overpriced. But nowadays it's different. None of the PC laptops today have as much specs as a MacBook Pro. The nearest comparable laptops are Alienware's that cost couple of hundred bucks extra than an Apple laptop.   Having said that, I used to be a complete Apple hater back in the days. And by hate I mean I never thought I would buy an Apple product ever in my life. And her I am.   I run three OS. Both XP and Windows 7 and of course Mountain Lion.

Thought so.
Unfortunately, League isn't the type of game where you can say, "Well, I've got a little time. I'll hop on for a quick match!" Definitely only try to play when you *know* you won't have to get up and leave in the middle of a match. Don't let this get to you, but when you leave a match, you're potentially ruining the game for 9 other players. Try to take your potential teammates' and opponents' time into consideration when judging whether you'll have time for a match.

I don't get it 
I am not a theist, and so I don't want to steal anyone's opportunity to answer, but no one is responding, so I will just pose the answers that I hear quite often.  Many times I have heard it said about the god of Abraham that he values free will and faith, and if he appeared to us and made it blatantly clear that he existed, we wouldn't have a choice but to believe.  In such a case, free will and faith go right out the window.  I've also heard it said, in other words, that god is not a monkey meant to dance on stage.  He is not "at our beckon call" to perform tricks in the way of our desired wishes and miracles.  I've never found either a particularly satisfactory answer, but they seem relatively common.
are you able to see if it still works?  I know a lot of the older third party memory cards have run into issues

&gt;I expected a reversal of bush's policies not new ones like NDAA. A fair point - those are definitely policies that I'm very disappointed in Obama for pursuing.  &gt;I expected all troops to be brought back. You clearly weren't paying attention during the election since Obama's position was quite explicitly that he wanted to wind down the Iraq war so we could focus more on Afghanistan.  &gt;I expected habeas corpus being re-instituted.. Obama definitely tried on this one, but was blocked by the GOP.  I find it hard to assign too much blame for trying and failing. &gt;I expected legalization of marijuana Again, you clearly weren't paying too much attention.  Though the marijuana may explain that one...
