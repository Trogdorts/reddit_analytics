“It takes a different breed of person to wake up everyday at 3 am to unload trailers.” - My SD
Alrighty, I'll talk "qualifications" Teddy Roosevelt was a war hero with very minimal in the way of education. George Washington had even less education and while he was a war hero he was far from the greatest tactician and often called on others for planning and strategy. George W. Bush was a businessman. Ronald Reagan was just an actor who won office purely through popularity. Trump is a failing entrepreneur who sought the presidency for financial gain. Bit of a pattern here as most of the presidents whom didn't have "qualifications" would have fallen under the modern definition of republican. If you'd like some proof. Abe Lincoln was a democrat and studied law. Barak Obama was a lawyer who studied at Harvard Law. And Joe Biden studied law at Syracuse University. As far as Kamala Harris, She studied at the UC Hastings College of Law in 1989 meaning that not only is her education exceeding Donald Trump's and many other candidates, it's also more recent and up-to-date as far as newer laws and ways we deal with legal issues.

Given your severe symptoms despite being so young (21 M) I would really recommend aggressive treatment, it's better to do this kind of stuff while you're young than procrastinate and let it get progressively worse.  I agree the sleep study is a great idea, I would also try and make sure the sleep lab uses the AASM 1A criteria (3% desaturation) for hypopneas (as opposed to 4%) to try and avoid the possibility of a false negative, it can be an issue in especially young and thin OSA cases.  CPAP could also help improve your symptoms if you do test positive, though there are arguments for jaw surgery as well, such as the fact you may not need a CPAP after jaw surgery, the cosmetic side, and even some people find CPAP doesn't work for them at all (either ineffective or can't sleep with it). Some people call it a last resort but for a 21 year old personally I don't think it's a big deal, sure the recovery sucks but afterwards you'll have a new jaw for your entire life.  If you want to see an ortho who specializes in the jaw I would see an MSE provider from this list: [https://www.moonmse.com/distributors-1](https://www.moonmse.com/distributors-1)

Ouch. I had to deal with a love seat. I came to a complete dead stop and  vehicles behind  me started to stop and swerve. 2 vehicles ended up on side ditch. The 2 individuals who were transporting the love seat just put it on the roof of their civic secured by one hand from each person. They were watching this on the side of the road while it was happening, hoping to get it back. They left immediately after highway patrol arrived.
They won some money and got some exposure but unless they back it up with some strong runs the rest of the season it probably won’t make too much of a difference past this season.
&gt;Landscaping isn't renovation  You can absolutely renovate a yard.  Renovate definition: to restore to good condition; make new or as if new again  &gt;Replacing a kitchen requires plumbing  It requires minimal plumbing if the layout stays the same. A home owner could do it.  &gt;You cannot resize a window frame without a permit  Okay? At no point have I mentioned resizing. I talked about upgrading from one pane ton two, not enlarging the size.  &gt;High voltage electrical work more than 48V requires an electrician  I very clearly stated homeowners are allowed to do MINOR electrical work.   &gt;I don't care about your area.  I'm sorry, are you failing to comprehend where you live could have different rules and regulations than where i do?  &gt;When a man says he's not using a plumber it electrician, he gets ridiculed for being a cowboy.  I genuinely have no fucking idea what you're talking about here.

It depends on the allegations, how strong the evidence is, how long it will take to investigate/resolve them, what the succession chain and temporary replacements for the position are.  Those two should be kicked out.  I'm not sure why you say "wake up america", half of america is already awake and doesn't put up with stuff like this from its politicians.
Because there certainly weren't any conservatives or Republicans who took a boat to a lake, went camping, blew up some fireworks, or daydrank while enjoying a three day weekend.

Sadly that points to him not being dominant :(.  If dominance is something you need, it probably isn't going to work.
Agreed with everything you said above. Would also like to just add, it is often associated with (not sure if causation or correlation) excessive drinking culture, which can be very harmful in its own way.  One of my dad's stories from college was how when he was at a frat party and they had a big bonfire going (rural middle of nowhere). They ran out of wood and were quite inebriated, so they started chucking furniture from the frat house into the fire. My dad didn't stay around to find out what happened next, but it's no suprise that Greek living has since been banned there since they attended.
Stricter gun laws would perhaps prevent future assholes like this. People want even more lax open carry laws in TX. I shouldn’t have to see people carrying ARs around and wonder if they are about to start shooting. When it’s common to have over 10 mass shootings in a single American weekend, fighting for open carry is disgusting.

You think people are gonna wanna spend all that time that they got banned just to prove it to you? If rockstar can see it (and they have before) then they will ban you. Regardless of that, don’t even bother trying it if it’s not worth the risk. Otherwise do what you want man.

It would be better to expose the functionality required by the child as methods of the parent.  Exposing the internals of one object to another makes it difficult to make changes later, since more than one class is dependent on the implementation details of a single class.

I would stop using microfiber in the pockets. They are notorious for compression leaks (think sponge when you squish it). Invest in bamboo, cotton, hemp (natural  fibers). We use all mama koala during the day and have a cotton prefold wrapped around a hemp doubler. Our toddler is a flooder so we have added some bamboo on top of it in the pocket, but if your child is younger than a toddler the prefold wrapped around a hemp doubler should do the trick. I hope that helps.  Our night times are BumBumBabies AI1.5 which come with bamboo cotton inserts and we just add a couple more bamboo inserts to the pockets.

Do you have an Objective section at the top under your name? Is the home address listed under your name in the US? That’s most important.

You know, there was a team several years ago that was in a similar situation to what we have now. The team was favored against and went up 3 games to 1. But their opponent rallied and tied the series, so the team had to play game seven at home. That team stomped the hearts out of their opponents in a memorable game.  That team was named the Boston Bruins and their opponent the Toronto Maple Leafs. If the Leafs can just channel Boston in that series, they can still win.

you're right, but in practical terms couldn't it be a little of both? the government is the one that forces them to use identification, and while it doesn't force valve to ban them it does hurt their sales to the point where they would be better off not selling them at all. when the government gets involved, you pull that stuff or else you get singled out as the guys selling the hot coffee mod even if you lose out on a bit of sales from the adult games themselves.  its ultimately on valve for pussying out but you can't really blame them that much.

A few years ago I bought a “vintage” box off of Amazon.  It was definitely not the Original and I was supremely disappointed.  These need a comeback, with extra white sharks.  I have yet to find gummies with the same amazing flavor and texture
Here's my point in a nutshell: I claim that it is perfectly fine to agree that 'is actual' is indexical while insisting on actualism. This was Stalnaker's point in his paper from the '60s I mentioned above. 'World w is actual' is false when evaluated at this world and true when evaluated at world w. At the same time, only this world is actual.   The analogy is the following: the presentist is perfectly happy to agree that (as is really obvious) 'now' is indexical (in normal conditions it refers to the time of utterance). 'It is now noon' is true at noon and false at 3PM. However, the presentist can still insist that only the present exists. The two positions are completely independent of each other.   Both my points about 'is actual' and about 'now' are pretty uncontroversial points in contemporary semantics so I'm not going to try and argue for them here (that would get pretty complicated and I'm not sure how to go about it; I guess Kaplan's classic paper 'Demonstratives' would be relevant?).   Maybe your problem is the idea that I can evaluate a sentence at a context even when I don't believe an element of that context has *real, genuine* existence. But evaluating a sentence at a context is a rather formal, logical technique without obvious metaphysical implications. I can be a nominalist or whatever about other times while still agreeing that 'now' when I use it refers to the time I use it and hence 'now' when I used it ten minutes ago referred to ten minutes ago. The presentist *has* to tell a story about what 'It was raining ten minutes ago' means, after all (e.g. I'm referring to something that technically no longer exists). Whatever story they end up telling will allow them to give the standard semantics for 'now'.   To be fair, I haven't read a ton about presentism because I think it's straightforwardly incompatible with Relativity Theory and runs into quite few other issues too.
I took this photo because I have been playing around with and loving vertical framing recently and when I saw this as I was walking down hill I just had to capture it, with the positioning of the trees and the munroe I saw the photo op straight away and had this vision.  I was stood on the very edge of a rocky hill on the descent down from The Cobbler with my dslr to capture this at the right angle I wanted and to make sure I got that rule of thirds framing. It’s a handheld shot - hiking up a mountain with a tripod ain’t where it’s at!  I’d like to know if you guys think I can improve upon framing/positioning at all? I’m open to any feedback however, the more variety the merrier!

I’m not sure you could call it a choice. From my own experience as a person with major, suicidal depression, watching devastatingly sad movies felt...right? That’s the only word I can use. I really felt those emotions as if I was really experiencing them, and I chalked it up to being an extra-sensitive person. I actually enjoyed that. Now that I am mentally much healthier, I would never go down that rabbit hole.   Having said all that, you mom may not be experiencing traditional, classic depression. She may simply be unable to face life without alcohol. She may be mentally checked out. She may be upset in ways that she formerly masked with alcohol. She may still be detoxing. There are many possibilities. It is impossible to know what is going on in her mind. Have you had any conversations with her?
I didn't feel like her campaign video reflected a makeup launch. I do believe it's a beauty product because she said on Twitter she hasn't been this nervous since her lipstick launch. That said, it's Jaclyn so you never know.  Edit: This campaign video reminds me a lot of Norvina and her weird photo shoots she does whenever she has a launch. Just went on IG and saw the Norvina #5 palette is coming out soon. Go figure.

I was literally writing a post similar to this, everything here I can vouch for being accurate information, I have a past in cheating and I know what he said is true.
I am always suspicious of pictures or memes that include a quote that the person in the picture supposedly said.  I totally believe that there are people out there who would do such things as eat more meat than normal thinking it would somehow hurt the feelings of a vegan though.  Some people are dumb like that
From a legal perspective, there’s very little teeth to the allegations against him.   I wouldn’t be surprised if he settles for an undisclosed amount of money to make it go away, without admitting guilt... because he’s very likely to win at a civil trial, and very unlikely to be subject to criminal proceedings at all, much less be convicted of a criminal act.
100% agree

I've always loved alternative reality advertisements, namely because they don't require an explanation, the existence of a product to meet a need, and an advertisement promoting said product immediately supercedes any creative liberties. It's so interesting how fictional ads are arguably just as effective as non fiction because they use the same tricks and tropes to close the sale. The same reason Nuka-Cola is so iconic, even more likely to be remembered than some fairly significant plot points and characters.
I think people should be more aware of this then they already are

I just don't remember the meme being widespread - like nowadays we have internet articles about certain  memes, or everyone knows about certain memes, and I don't remember that with "binders full of women". And I wasn't confused, I think it's hilarious, because if the meme isn't well known, that means Commander Lawrence looks at memes in his spare time!
There's an H-Mart in Riverdale and a Nam Dae Mun in Morrow. There's also a decent smaller Asian market in PTC I've stopped at before called J-Mart, but no idea if they would have that.
Fiquei a saber que Oporto também está correto em inglês, e é até a forma mais antiga de se referirem à cidade 😆  Segundo ouvi dum historiador da nossa praça(já não me lembro o nome do homem) a forma "Oporto" era a mais utilizada em inglês à 100/200 atrás, está comprovando em correspondências e documentos da época, apenas "Porto" é a forma mais utilizada recentemente. "Oporto" ainda é utilizado no espanhol.

I guess. I don't do it with royalty or nobility either. Hereditary rule and divine right are stupid concepts IMO. I hate the idea that a bunch of arbitrary "because we say so" guidelines somehow make some people better than others. But I'm a bit of an anarcho-socialist so that's probably rubbing off on my attitudes toward these types of authority figures.

They haven't stopped the tide of prosecutions to come. Sedition is a real crime and some of them (including their beloved leader) are fully implicated in the Jan 6 insurrection. Michael Flinn just stepped over the line advocating a coup against our government. He may end up first in court now but the others will surely follow.  They can try to litigate this with propaganda but their influence is fading. As they trickle through the justice system the truth will become apparent to all but the most fanatical. Their brand of fear and hate is not what America is about. I truly believe justice will prevail in the end.

the reason why I suggest kyf is because something like this would could be really frustrating as a main game mode and furthermore would be even harder to balance than the sole game mode.

Hey! I appreciate the nice discussion and hitting alot of the major topics, and thanks for the compliment on the tutorial improvements I definitely think that was the best thing I added into the post, and it's the only real 100% positive change.  I'd like to hit a few of your counter points where I think I was perhaps a little unclear and so you may have misunderstood what I meant.  Firstly, I do fully recognize that my experience with players is completely personal but I would like to give myself some credit in that it is nearly 4000 hours of personal experience in ranked alone, and these sentiments are held by many of my friends who also play the game. So yes it is not representative of every person's experience but I do think it is certainly a large enough sample pool across enough ranks to make it decently relatable.  Secondly, my use of the term trolling here isn't relating to just bad players or people who would often be labeled as trolls when they actually just kinda suck. I am using that as general shorthand for the players who steal roles out of anger, sell their build mid game for full MS etc etc. The people are very clearly doing shitty things and making sly remarks about it in chat and all that shit.  Thirdly, and this is where I think you misunderstand me the most. I do not think anyone in the ranked scene is comparable to an SPL player rn (excluding ex spl players ofc) but I DO think there are many people in the SCC who are. High end SCC players, with time to practice and compete in the same league could 100% compete in the SPL, while extremely the highest tier ranked players who compete in the amateur league could totally fill the spots of low end SCC teams, which would then open up spots for more ranked players to join the amateur league and practice playing as a team. So it's of course just a cycle of good players moving up and making a larger, more interesting League.   Finally while I agree that it would be foolish to assume Smite/TitanForge/Hirez did no market research but it's also a bit foolish to ignore the very much less than stellar history for the business side of the company. They are not exactly marketing geniuses so criticism is very much needed to keep them lined up I think.
&gt;  400 years.  Much older if you count those from northwest of Iran (which not sure if technically they are a diaspora?):  &gt; The Armenian people are amongst the native ethnic groups of northwestern Iran (known as Iranian Azerbaijan), having millennia-long recorded history there while the region (or parts of it) have had made up part of historical Armenia numerous times in history. These historical Armenian regions that nowadays include Iranian Azerbaijan are Nor Shirakan, Vaspurakan, and Paytakaran. Many of the oldest Armenian chapels, monasteries and churches in the world are located within this region of Iran.  The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastery_of_Saint_Thaddeus seems to have components from the 7th century while as per the wiki legend says it is 2 millennia old.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Armenian_churches_in_Iran#Northern_Iran

I don't allow these sorts of things in my game. I can't stand this kind of *zany* shit.   It's goofy and very selfish. It adds nothing to the game, it makes it extremely difficult for the other plays to play around and it makes it almost impossible for the DM to write and make things that are "fair".  I make sure to state that sort of thing is unacceptable in any session 0.   A lot of players (especially ones that aren't very experienced) come out of the game with these wild ideas of these crazy characters they want to play. I've done it before.   But they are difficult to plan around, some of their made up character rules don't make much sense or are difficult to balance or they want some rick and morty bullshit.  I'm against that sort of thing. I generally find it best if your character starts out bland. A youngling, a nobody, some bland dude. Their character story is in the game, at the table, not before.

You're confusing concepts.   Tolerance means they get to live their lives without being discriminated against or facing hostility. Acceptance means their behavior is, well, acceptable. It means that the church has to toss aside their teachings, that the Christian baker has to bake the gay wedding cake. It means that their behavior is as preferable as the traditional standard.   Acceptance and normalization are the same, but tolerance does not mean acceptance.

I rarely watch IndyCar because if this. I live in the states and I can't stand Indy coverage. I want to enjoy it so much but they make it so hard.   Might also just be my preference to F1 but the announcers drive me nuts, they are all over the place with there conversations and tracking of drivers.  I'm from the states but got into F1 before Indy so I guess I've been spoiled.

100% disagree. If you mean we will run out of tokens (cents or dollars) bitcoin is potentially infinitely divisible.  If you are saying that because of the keynesian economics theory, then I say you probably aren't versed in the history of bitcoin. The biggest reason bitcoin was created, and especially having a cap, is because it was supposed to be a system that fought those exact reasons. I believe keynesian economics, especially relating to inflation is flawed at its core.

Last night I went to the Redwood Drive-in Theater and saw "A Quiet Place II".  I didn't really like the movie, but it was something to do.  It was either that or stay home and stare  at the walls.

The stuff you directly encounter in the games is mostly sane. The insanely cryptic "literal metaphor" stuff is frequently alluded to, but never outright shown.  For example, Tamriel isn't the only continent on Nirn, but it's the only one where time functions normally. In the North, there's Atmora, which is frozen because of its geographical location, but also frozen in time. In the West, there was Yokuda, a continent that is dead and gone because it's the past. In the East, there's Akavir, and what little we do know of it is blatantly self-contradictory due to the future being neither knowable nor set in stone. On the opposite side of the globe, there's Lyg, and pretty much all that's known about it is that it's a sort of Bizarro Tamriel.
Thankfully, no one died in that building due to prior warning by the IDF, I dont know what your point is. That is just an example of how they try avoid civilian casualties

Same here. I think it's either that or they deliberately tried to lie as much as possible to make the entire picture chaotic and impossible to re-create. But currently, I lean toward the former more. The latter requires a truly masterful performance.
Accepting love from someone. If is someone i don't like i'm repulsed. If is someone i like i might get nervous. I feel like i have to be inside a relationship to fully accept the love. Otherwise it kinda freaks me out, in a 'i don't think they love me as much as i love them' kinda way.

It’s good to think of ideas and socialize them.  Unfortunately I feel this one is flawed because it just replicates the same fiat systems we have in place at a country level.  One of the main problems with this system is converting value between 2 countries. I feel your idea would have all the same problems of the current system and only make the currency digital.   I do think you will see countries create their own digital currency, but this is not the same a crypto currency.

Well, we don’t definitely know that. You may be absolutely right, but that is why you ask the parent first.

She would take me to get mother/daughter manicures by about 8 or 9 though because I’d gotten past that.

Easy one: souls. They see an undefended plane FILLED with souls, they swarm like flies to honey.  Bit spicier: demons. Devils may have a lust for souls and power, but an even greater hatred of demons. Say the demons got there first. Now the devils invade just to expel the demons (and get some sweet sweet mortal souls too while they're at it).  Even spicier: Nine Hells intrigue. Perhaps one archdevil, let's say Levistus, has stationed his forces on this plane to steadily corrupt mortals, and perhaps was a big player in the gods abandoning the realm. Levistus has a rival, named Geryon. Perhaps Geryon musters his forces to route the forces of Levistus, to spite his rival but also to claim the same undefended and precious resource Levistus got unfettered access to: souls.

There's simply not enough room (and you're not getting a top-5 draft pick) to add elite talent, so you have to try and keep the core together as long as possible.  Man, this is where Lou's hideous contracts for Leo and Greene just absolutely kill the Islanders. That's $5 million against next year's cap for both of them. An absolute tire fire.

Pasted from a brother from our Telegram:  SAFERmoon is currently one of the most undervalued projects out there. It's the SAFER and actually useful alternative to meme-only tokens. Audited by BSC Gemz, the most trusted community on the Binance Smart Chain. Unruggable, with a transparent development and moderating team that actually cares and engages with the community on a daily basis, while keep building.   The goal is to create a SAFER BSC ecosystem overall, which becomes more and more important with each passing day that brings new rugs &amp; flash loan attacks. Through the soon-launching SAFERpad that deploys battle-tested code only, not only can investors of new tokens rely on safety but it also creates even more utility for SAFERmoon holders.

Those who tip must accept their culpability in a system of exploitation.  Tipping conversations often involve comparisons of tipped income to *minimum wage*. Think about that: they're so exploited that they can't imagine their worth to be more than the absolute minimum allowed under the law, so tips are seen as a nice bonus, rather than what they actually are: barely making ends meet by begging despite providing a valuable service.

It's really not though. Quite depressing really, It has nothing to do with the fortnite. Rather the fact that he has to stream anything for 10+ hours a day doing this to pay for his father's treatment. Anything you wind up having to do for 10+ hours a day is going to kill any enjoyment you ever had doing it.   Look at his face. He's not enjoying it, its just probably the thing he hates the least when he has to do it 10+hrs/day.

So my kid has ________disease/disorder we tried treating as a child and it never  worked instead of making sure she's in facility having her basic needs met for the rest of her life she's on her own.  Some people can not cope with basics like daily hygiene and bill paying.  If the diagnosis was cancer, cerebral palsy, anything else and the adult child wasn't capable of taking care of themselves we would be outraged.  21 years ago they had a child and if that child may never be able to live independently.  I don't care why.

Well it's fairly confusing on what exactly to do in a society hell-bent on analyzing and often mistaking all things men do as sex driven.  I have a fairly easy time getting laid btw, it's easier as a man to just kind of sit back and let all this shit go and just be fake until you know the person you are dealing with.  They can either be way too extreme and think mutual drunken sex is rape. Those people are scary.  Or worse, there's the type of people who don't understand social boundaries.  Between the two extremes it's easier to just be an asshole.

Good advice. Please dispose quick, both house pets and wild animals could die from this. Unfortunately it is fairly common with owls and other birds of prey since their instinct is to catch injured and twitching prey.
They were way too sensitive and strict with their policies. I also found it quickly turned into an echo chamber and if your view on a matter differed, you would quickly be ganged up on by snarky passive aggressive and border line bullying type comments. It was a keyboard warriors paradise. Glad that place is shutting down, it was awful but had some perks. I’m guessing it was a financing issue - how many active users do they have to raise advertising revenue with. Reddit is a much more cost effective solution.
Just to compare ms bought bethesda for 7.5b really puts those numbers into how over valued it is.

you chose me THX first time I win Something ,
Yes it totally did. I got the exact same results as when I went to the salon but not gonna lie, it really killed my arm. Its hard to iron your own hair and make sure you get  everything. Ugh but I saved a lot and apparently, it lasts for 4 to 6mos so its worth it.
It was just cack handed and not really knowing what to do given little notice, it was also them thinking about their fees.
Done it most of my life. I’m cool with it.

U just proved that you have no beliefs whatsoever, anybody remotely pro socialism or lgbtq rights could have remembered to countless laws proposed by trump to delegitimize the lgbtq community and prevent them from receiving legal recognition or in the case of trans people, use their preferred bathroom. Women’s rights would have also gotten scraped and even now his judges are working against demolishing roe vs wade.  Im going to be real 100 here, u are a reactionary moron whose hate for america prevents u from properly thinking or analyzing any given scenario and to achieve your goal u would allow fascism to come to power. You are a dangerous demagogue whose ignorance hurts to people you claim to want to liberate and youre way of thinking is why leftism struggles to succeed, after all u only care about the aesthetics of your gate-kept socialism

It should reduce in volume by about half, i use just the pinch of salt and vinegar and olive oil- light oil! It goes a long way. Let sit a minimum of an hour, even better overnight it gets more tender! Good for several DAYS it’s just tender and delicious so i make a mega batch for lunch salads and add some chickpeas or lentils and nuts, whatever other veg and a handful of leftover cooked quinoa or barley. Swap around what you add each day so it’s not literally the same thing, been a favorite lunch option forever   [the gets better lentil salad ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bonappetit.com/recipe/make-ahead-lentil-salad/amp) Is a great starting point, i do a lot less oil add more veggies and skip the cheese

If cost is not concern, Telekom has the best network IMO so their unlimited data plan would be the best: https://www.telekom.de/mobilfunk/tarife/smartphone-tarife  I don’t think Google Fi plans are sold outside of the U.S. although you can use it abroad.

From SC, relocated to CO. Nature between the east coast and west are vastly different. Not better and worse, just different. You’ll have hiking options in the blue ridge and Appalachia but it won’t compare to hiking in the mountain west. It’s very green which is something I miss. You never adjust to humidity ever. Born and raised and never adjusted to it. Always feel like you’re mildly suffocating. But I lived in Charleston for 7 years and the humidity there had nothing on a work visit to Austin TX in the month of May.

Saying from the very beginning that it's nothing to be afraid of. Saying that it'll be "gone in weeks" for literally 9 months. Not telling people to get vaccinated.

This is less like storebought stuff, but possibly a good start: equal parts mayo and sour cream, a clove of garlic (grated or minced) and a scallion/green onion for every 75 ml of mayo-sour cream blend, salt and pepper to taste, lemon juice, and some minced (or freeze-dried) parsley (volume depends on taste and whether fresh or dried). The lemon juice makes it tangy and cuts the fattiness of the mayo.  I usually make 250-300 ml at a time and use a half a lemon (more if the lemon is small or dry).  The storebought stuff is a little sweeter, though, so you may want to either cut back on the lemon or add a touch of sugar.  (Full disclosure: I also make this with cilantro/fresh coriander instead of parsley, and sometimes I cheat by throwing everything into a cup and blending it until it's basically pale green.)  The garlic flavor gets stronger after it sits a couple hours.

Well those are mostly rants, but they also miss the point: Jeff Bezos will personally profit off of these deals without doing any work. Which makes the "contract" a handout. Because he will be making a return with someone else's (taxpayer) investment.  K?

Couldn't you have at least suspended Reaves for 3 games so he would have to sit the rest of this season?

Aubrey is great. He's a highlight of the later seasons. In contrast, I don't love all the intern-centric storylines they did when they lessened the Booth and Brennan screen-time, but Aubrey was always worthwhile.
You say that but I'm already enjoying legends anniversary more then I will dokkan. We have raid's, we had multiple new f2p units to grind.  Of course it's cookie cutter, dokkan content is cookie cutter too if you look at it the same way. I can't wait to see what comes with rest of part 1 and what we get in part 2.

Should aid given to coastal cities after a hurricane be contingent on them properly preparing for a hurricane like not building in flood zone or storm surge zones in hurricane prone areas? Should the whole state of florida just be told to fuck off and stop building near water every hurricane season?  When have we even made aid to people or businesses be contingent on consequences for other people?   Should the MPD not be given any funding because they allowed officers shitty enough to murder on camera be employed by them for decades?

Society doesn’t change overnight, you’re right. But aiming towards acceptance vs liberation decides how we try to change it. i have no interest in making change that allows cis het people to develop an abstract idea of queerness that they can then pigeonhole queer people into. I’d rather work to dismantle the structures that hold queer people back from being who they are, and many of those structures are set up by these same corporations.
Yeah that one actually seems pretty fun
Israel made 3 different operations, spending hundreds of millions and risking Israeli lives to bring tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews from Ethiopia and refugee camps in Sudan to Israel, just to sterilize them and try to get rid of them.. then even after seeing a source that contradicts them and sheds some light upon this case, they will push this lie again next time some naive westerners are discussing the conflict. It's crazy how blind hatred affects critical thinking.

Upam da kmalu lahko grem spet v Slovenijo in obiščem mojo babico (obiskala sem jo v 2017 ko ona še je živela v Nemciji).

NTA   I am a nurse. My son wanted to play but his father (who played football) and i said no.  His pediatrician also said he shouldn’t play. He was disappointed but ran cross country and played soccer instead and was an outstanding athlete in both sports.  Football is a dangerous sport, and as a nurse I saw too many traumatic brain injuries - I just put my foot down about football.

And your source is...?
Not really high Elves necessarily but more so Yvresse. I love everything about the faction in terms of looks, especially the mistwalker units. It just feels like a faction made solely for defense and offense to keep themselves safe. Knights of Tor gaval are one of the best units imo, especially in looks. They can tank most battles if managed properly and get a serious kill count. And eltharion is just such a fun lord to play, especially with stormwing. I LOVE the color scheme of yvresse, WAY more high elfy than others. Also they are the only H.e faction I feel can justify their superiority to others because of how powerful they are and all the threats they've faced successfully. Also starting in the old world as H.e is super refreshing. Plus the athel Tamara mechanic,in terms of how it feels and looks really adds more in depth feeling to the aesthetic of yvresse. And the fact that Henry Cavill/Gerald of rivia is basically a hero for them and no other faction has a real life counterpart.

You could get some basic tools and rig up a diesel heater for your truck camper (with a separate diesel tank). All you really need is a Jackery/goal zero or similar, a hole for the exhaust, and $200 for a Chinese diesel heater plus a portable enclosure.

Also just started playing - Expected a rough few hours - they were an absolute joy to play however, was scratching my head wondering what people are complaining about.   The only desire I have is to be able to turn off the narrator during dialogue with NPCs - They oddly have quite a bit of personally, if you have enough imagination. The exploration and chill factor is amazing, the combat is way better than I expected and the issues that people were bringing up are way less jarring than I thought they may be. I found 3 chests behind a waterfall!  The game rewards exploration which I adore!  Can't wait to jump back in!
Were you very close to retiring and found revitalization in a new stable with Bobby Lashley, Shelton Benjamin, and Cedric Alexander? Because you're the real MVP.
There’s not a lot of community arrangements.  The DFW area is huge.  Rangers own north central Texas and there are a lot of poor communities that aren’t on there.  Maybe that’s where we should strive for first instead of sexuality and exclusivity to get the financially challenged in the game, which is gender and sexuality benign.

Maybe when I get a Doom I can try it, since I only found one of the hypershunts so far. Still I found this way very straightforward all the while using ships that a player will probably be able to manufacture before Dooms. At least I'm in endgame and still haven't found the Doom blueprint.

Probably not, if Scotland wants out I’m sure they don’t want any amount of connection to the remainder of the UK including the monarchy, along with the queen probably not agreeing to a possible continuation of the monarchy in an independent Scotland since she’d more than likely support a United Britain over a divided one

I do a 100g old starter/100g whole wheat/100g water change once a week.  I discard or cook with the discarded portion.  I sit it on the counter (about 72 degrees F) for about 5 hours.  After the 5 hours, I just screw the top on the mason jar and throw it in the fridge.  Repeat weekly.  When cooking, I do the same ratios and let it sit for 4 to 5 hours.  This part can't be rushed...It will help your final product.  If the starter doesn't bubble, do a few days of twice a day changes until it doubles in size within the 4-5 hours.
you “tripped” cuz u rushing to hit em. nigga was being patient and dropped you

Omg stop... you’re joking... the first time I ever used my Ouija board, I got in contact with ZoZo (who is the so called “demon on the Ouija Board”) and my friends and I all woke up with bloody noses the next day... I’ve never heard of someone else having such a similar experience. I became a lot more experienced and in tune with my board but now I’m selling it because it’s served it’s purpose with me and I’d like to stick on the good side of the spirits hehe 🔮 buuuuuut that night we all asked ZoZo very personal questions about deaths in our families that no one else in the group knew and that’s when I was exposed to the truth that spirits exist! Crazy world, be careful😳
yeah it's unfair on the other students all it does is make noise. Teachers should be allowed to get rid of disruptive students
Could be, yeah.  I thought he was bleeding because of the knee rub in his face or the ice.  Skated on ice is really rough, as anyone who has slid skin across it knows, and the sock over the kneepad isn't super soft either. That hair being ripped out though... and I didn't see the camera angle presented by the NHL discipline video that really shows the knee squishing on Graves head.  Those two items alone more than justify the suspension in my mind.

I ran an offset smoker back in college for a year or so so I had a little experience but ever since then Iv been smoking using a Treager. After this first smoke you under estimate how much the CPU is actually doing for you on the Treager. However, it’s so much more satisfying once you done with your cook because of how much work you put in. My big piece of advice is learn you smoker, learn what the temp does when you open or shut the damper 1/2 way, or when you add a split of wood. They are great smokers and it’s so rewarding when you pull your meat off.

Which makes no sense because skintone looks different under different lighting. Like I'm of SEA descent and I have neutral olive skintone. My skin looks tan indoors or in low lighting, but when I step out into bright sunlight it's much lighter.  (also I find a lot of those "recolors" racist too? because a lot of them make idols' skin too yellow or too orange and no actual Asian's skin looks like that, either)
That doesn't work anymore as lullaby doesn't get affected by madness and neither does unnerving presence.

The Catholic schools teach “Family Life Education”, this isn’t taught in public schools (thankfully). This is an example of public schools being more inclusive. As we all know babies come from many places... men and women who fall in love and get married... orrrr test tubes! Or surrogates... to two loving mamas or 2 loving dads... to single parents by Choice... etc etc  Edit to add. The program is “fully Alive” as part of family life education... pushing church values on children with public funds

&gt;How do you know they weren't a threat? Either to Ted, or in fact humanity? We only saw Ted's methods results...  If you play the game you know exactly what the Alphas are doing. They weren't a threat.  &gt;He intended to do good. Does all such intent that requires harm, become evil?  He intended to murder people and then he murdered people.  &gt;If killing one saves four, does refusing make you good? Does doing it make you evil?  Except he isn't killing one to kill four. He is killing seven to save no one. This is like the trolley problem except you are already on a track that won't kill anyone and you would have to switch tracks to kill seven people. It isn't a difficult ethical conundrum.  &gt;Then how about the opposite? Does committing good make you good? Has there ever been a person that hasn't done a mix of both?

Bro this market is totally exclusive from 2008.. this is retarded. The market crashed because of shitty securitization of MBS and unqualified borrowers/risky balloon loans. There’s a difference between supply shortages and people not wanting to work versus people not being able to find a job. What goes up must come down but it doesn’t need to crash and if it does crash it’ll be for an entirely different reason. This post is retarded - be better
I kind of assumed that the white moon logo disappearing *is* the new moon because that's what it is. The moon not showing in the night sky. So that made sense to me, visually.

This may not necessarily be the case, because a lot of the PvP changes came when PS5 was released and I got a lot worse (matchmaking, stasis, etc) around this time, but it's damn sure not because you can see more and it's smoother lol. It's the state of PvP.

Their energy generation business is potentially very very very lucrative.  There’s been a lot of news out there about this smart power grid.  With Biden’s infrastructure plans favoring sustainability, Tesla will get more government cheese.  Just open leaps.

"Storm was an infrequent specialist combat role for Sangheili serving in the Covenant, acting as shock-troopers for the original Empire"  (Halo Waypoint: Canon Fodder - Sending out an SOS and Fighting Worlds)  "While he no longer believed that the Forerunners were gods, he pretended to remain a devout follower of the Covenant religion as a cover for visiting Forerunner sites, enabling him to learn about various parts of Forerunner history. "  "Storm have become the usual military backbone of the Covenant remnant factions" Aka Jul Madama Covenant.  " this faction continued to worship the Forerunners and opposed the Swords of Sanghelios following the end of the Human-Covenant War" As, sharing the same religion and idealism.  "the organization itself was regarded as a religious cult as opposed to a full-fledged empire like the original Covenant."  Sources: Halo 4 Limited Edition, Mission Briefing, Spartan OPs,

because some beers are so big (barley wines) and there's such a large grain bill that not all the sugars end up the the final mash.  small beers tend to be the result of the "leftovers' of a large grain bill.  sometimes it's just not useful to continue trying to get sugars out, and you might as well do something with them. hence small beers.  hair of the dog has a great selection of ~3-3.5% small beers that are the dregs of Fred, Adam, and other high abv amazing beers they make.  why can't homebrewers do the same thing?

Few days ago, I posted about Nagoya Vtuber Exhibition and  It was overwhelmed liked it. I wasn't talked to anyone that they have an online version as well. However, they should pay the tickets for about 500 yen. It will lasted about until June 28 (not 20 I posted before).  Speaking to Foreign Vtuber at the Exhibition, some questions asked why is no 2434 EN and others. Because likely it was already debuted 2 weeks ago and stated that they needed to adapt sometime soon.  The most interesting part was the Vtuber Chronology from 2016 to present and also some fans are doing sticky notes for added to their "oshi" history.   My interesting part that what would *we* created our Vtuber Exhibition in the near future and not only centric to  NijiHolo as well but everyone else.

Whoa thats crazy

I read somewhere that when the food and oil are at the right temperature, food in the fryer actually absorbs less oil than on a flattop.  I assume that doesn't include any batter or breading, just the protein, but it was still interesting.  I never really had the, "just throw it in the fryer," mentality, but with that much weight on top of the poor chicken, there isn't going to be any moisture left bay the time it's done.  Never a fan of grill weights myself, especially on a flattop.
Travel gives me something to look forward to in life. I just enjoy seeing something new and breathtaking (usually nature). I think it can make you more enlightened than your former self, as someone else said. But I totally see what you are saying. I take issue with people who use it as a wealth flex or when it creates any air of superiority. Just because you're well-traveled definitely doesn't mean you can look down on anyone who's not.
So you want to be the man...

Are you asking because you can only go to one? Like you live in a town with one pro show and one open mic, and they're both on Fridays? Hmm, given the choice I'd say go to the pro show.   Week on week, vary it up. Go to the pro show one week, the open mic the next. You don't have to sign up for a spot at your first show, but there's nothing stopping you either. The earlier you sign up and do it, the better.   After you've been to a few of both, just keep going to the one that brings you the most joy.

yes!!! my bro committed suicide last year and its super sad and he doesnt regret it he said but i bet his next life if/when he reincarnates will b similar to his prior one, he is at peace and did more suffering on earth than anything, so thats def reassuring to hear. he was bullied in school, depressed, an alcoholic, had a personality disorder, and was also homosexual and asexual and didnt have many friends. i know his life was way harder than mine but your just basically giving up on your contract, but im hoping he waits to reincarnate after i die anyways. maybe we can come back again as siblings and i can be alot more protective of him in the next life ☹️
I test tank builds on most heroes and it's fun seeing the enemies' reaction when they can't kill you
I had one player who didn't seem that into his character, wasn't roleplaying heavily, was sort of doing the exact same things every battle.  Tried to gear a few more encounters his way but it just didn't seem to gel. Mind you there were some definitely very strong RPers in the group so maybe he was just letting them do all the talking or possibly felt a bit left behind.  He was playing a cleric, so I gave him a bit of a crisis of faith. At first I started fudging some rolls behind the screen (nothing obnoxious I don't think). He seemed cursed.  Sure enough, I wrote up a whole quest line aimed at him. Basically revolved around questioning, testing and then renewing his faith in his chosen deity. Basically the group ended up performing some tasks for another group of clerics/druids, and his curse grew. After an encounter with a sort of demonic creature he started developing fatigue that wouldn't go away with rest. His spells all were cast at disadvantage. Every night he'd have feverish dreams and visions of an empty field, devoid of life. Eventually in a bit of wild self doubt and surrender, demanded forgiveness from his god- only to reveal in a vision that   his deity  appreciated his devotion to *any* power as long as his intentions and actions were appropriate- one race's god of life and health was not all that different from another.  So he had a bit of an awakening and I give him some extra abilities. He automatically gained the knowledge of how to speak Elvish (was a halfling) and another trait or feat I can't recall right now.  After that he was much more conscious about "serving" his deity and their intentions, rather than simple checking boxes in an attempt at piety.
I did.

The Curies' newly discovered element of radium makes gleaming headlines across the nation as the fresh face of beauty, and wonder drug of the medical community. From body lotion to tonic water, the popular new element shines bright in the otherwise dark years of the First World War.Meanwhile, hundreds of girls toil amidst the glowing dust of the radium-dial factories. The glittering chemical covers their bodies from head to toe; they light up the night like industrious fireflies. With such a coveted job, these "shining girls" are the luckiest alive — until they begin to fall mysteriously ill.But the factories that once offered golden opportunities are now ignoring all claims of the gruesome side effects, and the women's cries of corruption. And as the fatal poison of the radium takes hold, the brave shining girls find themselves embroiled in one of the biggest scandals of America's early 20th century, and in a groundbreaking battle for workers' rights that will echo for centuries to come. Written with a sparkling voice and breakneck pace, The Radium Girls fully illuminates the inspiring young women exposed to the "wonder" substance of radium, and their awe-inspiring strength in the face of almost impossible circumstances. Their courage and tenacity led to life-changing regulations, research into nuclear bombing, and ultimately saved hundreds of thousands of lives...

Surely you see the problem with that, right? China's dominance in the manufacturing sector and international supply chains means it would be very difficult to convince large numbers of people to completely divest. You could get a few true believers to commit to that and call the others hypocrites until you're blue in the face, but to simply ask people to stop buying products made in China isn't a practical course of action. So what now?

Very smart idea. Who knows, maybe the ranger had issues before about prior incidents and this would cause an internal investigation. Or the supervisor may even steer OP into doing a FOIA request if it goes to court
Aw thanks. Ever since that wonderful “Don’t make a girl a promise” goodbye the two of the had at the end of H2, I’ve been shipping for them big-time, and your quote kinda sums that up.  Have you done any other art?
Stop looking at the mirror then.
I was training for an Ironman at the time so I think it was around 65. I went up Blanco through Bulverde and over 1863 and I think I tacked on some extra miles in there so it probably woulda been shorter if I went straight there.
It is fine, I mean, you just want to understand my perspective better, it isn't like you are emotionally hurt by the idea. I prefer people to speak their minds and like the conversation at least being on the table. Again, I could be wrong about this because I was an atheist for many years before I became a Christian and developed my own understanding about some of the doctrine.  Eventually, I believe that jesus will come back to earth visibly and at this point, everybody has the opportunity to be saved. Of course, some people will reject the messiah after he has definitely proven himself and these people will align against god. However, I believe everyone that accepts christ as the messiah when he is revealed will be saved. I think that the believers before he appears will have some kind of nobility and be blessed. This belief has nothing to do with actually being saved. The prerequisite to obtain this nobility is near infinitely low, if someone at some reach of their mind thinks it is at all possible that jesus is even maybe the savior or could be, even if he highly doubts it, christ will still break bread and consider this person a true Christian .  I think the popular interpretation of the doctrine is wrong and god ends up saving nearly all. Well anyway, I want to wish you well, on your pursuit on the knowledge of god. I hope it leads to a satisfying and rewarding life and answers your questions in a way that benefits your over all well being.
wait where can you watch on tuesday’s
Your industry is begging from us, you glorified panhandler, we can and will do whatever we want with it.

Said Tumblr users are also mentally incapable of discerning between the people who start a war and the soldiers who are sent to fight in it.  It’s a great example of cognitive dissonance and entitlement.
Try locking on with it! The shots become aware of an enemy from much further away, easily dispatching threats like the giant flying bugs in the desert.
I think the thing with Pop is that he's way better at helping players when they are in development, hence why he couldn't change Lamarcus, and he admitted making that mistake, as well as Derozan. Those two came to our team being 30 years old. It doesn't mean Popovich can automatically change a player, but I bet he could do wonders with players like Westbrook when they start in the league.
Honestly, why the fuck that does matter?  I'm fucking tired of fans in England telling us international fans that we are fake.  We fucking support the club through thick and thin. We buy merchandise to support the club. We buy subscription to support the club. We buy tickets to watch them play when they go abroad.  Sorry we can't fucking fly out to England to see a stadium. We have lives, family, and jobs.
It's comments like these that remind me that this sub and really reddit in general is full of 14 year olds
Yeah I was tier 1 (same time) and they said only til results are back. (Which is wrong that they would even say that if the website tells you we have to isolate)  If you’re tier 1 you’ll get a call though and they will have expected you to have isolated and continue. We have to get another test at 13 days if we report back negative

Incredible photo!! Are you George Steinmetz? If not, this reminds me of his work in a paramotor.   I also fly a ppg but need to step up my photography, but this is stunning.
Almost like normal people aren't druggie wierdos.

Perfect mom hot milf
Thanks man 😎
I think maybe you misunderstood what I meant by 'a good step forward' - that was to reference that this isn't the final step but is moving in the right direction.   By all means everyone should be able to support themselves fully. And this is going the right direction for that to occur.

I just google stuff to find recipes.  If you want a super easy way to prep some meals, start with rice mixes.  Get a box or two of zatarains or whatever type you want.  Brown some ground beef in a pot, add rice mix and cook according to the recipe on the box.  Usually means adding like 2 cups of water, bringing to a boil and then letting it simmer on low until the water is all absorbed.  Also super easy...tacos.  Brown ground beef or turkey.  Add taco seasoning packet and water, cook for like 10 min then serve with cheese and nonfat Greek yogurt on a tortilla.

That isn't necessary for salvation.
A far less punishment than eternal hell for not believing and worshipping him. We are the clay, he is the potter, and he has all the justified right to do with his creation as he pleases (Romans 9:21-23). He alone is worthy of all worship, and he demands that worship, not because he’s a megalomaniac, but because he is perfect and worthy. And he is all-knowing, so his assessment of his own value and thus his demanding that he alone be worshipped is RIGHT. So if he so chooses to kill whomever he chooses to kill for whatever reason he chooses, that is a justified cause because his will is perfect and his judgments are just and his standard is perfection. The town he destroyed that you mentioned (Sodom) refused to repent and their evil was rampant. They were murderers and rapists. God could not even find ONE good person in that town. His judgment was just. Imagine an American town filled with 100% murders and rapists and many other kinds of evil. Wouldn’t we call for justice? God delivered justice and now you call for grace? Fine, have your grace…it’s yours in Jesus. You can’t have it both ways. Your tottering on logical inconsistency here.  The real issue here is that you are equating God to a superhuman and evaluating him according to human morality. As if he must work according to our human standards of morality. When in actuality, God’s standard is the measure of morality, of which we all fall short. He determine right from wrong, we have to follow his morality. And his actions are not bound to our standards because he is sovereign over every single molecule in existence. So death in this life (even terrible deaths at the hand of God) are far easier to swallow than eternal damnation for rejecting his gracious gift of eternal life in Jesus. So your argument that God seems crazy for his behavior comes from viewing God from human standards. He creates the standard, we don’t follow it, then we face judgment, and it’s justified. BUT…God knows it’s impossible for us obey all his rules and thus be perfect. That is why in his love and grace he provided us with a Savior in whom we need only to believe, and thus escape his judgment and instead receive his eternal joy and reward of his presence (seem too easy? That’s the point). That is a good God. We deserve nothing because of our sinful nature. But he gives grace and provides a way to salvation.   Believe it or not, that’s up to you (I assume you won’t based on your last comment), but know that every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord…either in this life, or at his feet in judgment (Philippians 2:10-11). You’re clearly angry at this concept of God (I call him a concept because you say you don’t believe in him, but he is real). Have you ever considered that maybe your anger at God is actually the product of Christians who don’t do the things or say the things they claim? That they are terrible people but claim God? I could see how that could push you away. But keep in mind that just because God’s people are not perfect doesn’t make God imperfect or not real. That’s simply illogical. The fact that we are imperfect is the reason we need Jesus. That’s logical. We aren’t better, we’re just as sinful as everyone else, but we believe in Christ for salvation. Because we’re smarter? No! Because God was gracious to us and his patience that he is showing you today is meant to show you his kindness…to give you time to believe in Jesus for your salvation (Romans 2:4). Also, have you considered that maybe you’re angry at God because it helps you justify not being held accountable to him for your sin? If that is the case, ignoring his existence (claiming ignorance) is not a justifiable excuse to escape his judgment or to escape hell.  I hate when Christians tell non-Christians, “I’ll pray for you.” It sounds so pretentious and arrogant, as if to say, “Since I’m godly and you’re not, I’ll pray for you…you wicked evil person.” So, despite my hesitancy to say it…I WILL pray for you. Even if you don’t want me to and even if you think it’s arrogant. It is not arrogant, it’s the opposite…it’s dependence. It is me trusting that God can break through any barrier. Whether he does or not is up to him. My role is to be faithful to him, proclaim the truth, and pray for you. You can be angry at me, but I’m not the one you’ll have to face. He offers you his eternal joy. Take it.
I can’t find straight oxy where I am. And I like the act of snorting something , I tried popping them for a little bit but it’s like I’m addicted to the action of snorting
