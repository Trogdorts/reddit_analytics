The reason I was given for this when I worked at Walmart was that they only carry like 3 frozen pet items so the added electricity cost and space required by a separate refrigeration unit was not justified

My friend remembers things from before she was born, and being born. I have memories that span back to as early as 2 months old. (Validated by my parents)  I do hate to think I picked my parents.

Important tip: Restart the game and you don't have to wait 30 minutes.
The webpack server is strictly a development tool, you will not be running it in production. It‚Äôs very handy because it allows you to write code and see your changes live in the browser, without having to manually compile your source to JS every time you make a change. It does require you to open another port, but that‚Äôs only so it can do its job in development. Also, you can configure the webpack server to proxy requests to your actual backend on whatever port it serves from.  In production, you‚Äôll compile your React code ahead of time and serve it from a static directory or from a CDN. No need to worry about additional ports for the React stuff.  That being said, you can make React/Express more like PHP with server side rendering!

weekly shipments have 25 shards at 2,000 for each... then look for daily shipments, they pop up quite often... 80 crystals per shard... you missing around 280 shards in total, which will require like 22,000 crystals, or around 1.5 crate of crystals = $150 US.

Humans probably possess the absolute minimum cognitive skills necessary for science and technology.

Shulk and Greninja need a lot of time dedicated to get the most out of them and it's pretty normal if you don't feel they're pick-up-and-play. With Palu, you can get right into reading your opponent without worrying too much about your own spaghetti, but many other characters will feel weak until you master their niche mechanics and combo %s to get mileage out of them.

Some animations are obviously missing (especially on boss) and overall it looks pretty unfinished, but it's only a demo, so it's ok, I guess.   I like the idea that you'll be able to transform instantly, without breaking the pacing of the gameplay, but I still hope the dances will be used for something. It's an iconic part of the series, and I still want to see more dance animations to make up for the dissapointment that HGH gave me (only one dance move for everything, you must be kidding me).   Don't really get why they replaced monkey with a newt, though.  The biggest drawback for me so far is the new artstyle. It just doesn't fit the game's aesthetic (mostly because the game uses assets from HGH) and I don't like the way those dialog icons are cropped and presented on screen.
They also say the combat is repetitive but you have 5 diffrent legions with there own skills that you can switch anytime making combos and pairs I dont see it.

We have champs that can do things like this with an ability that isn't an ult but then Ornn can even place his Q where he wants it, it always has to be max range.
Also can we just cut the chop block crap?
Gonna preface this with I am by no means high elo, with that said my advice would be to find one role you want to main and an off role you are good at or can do well at (similar champ pools etc) so jng/top or mid/top bot/supp supp/jng and I say those because they either have champions in common or are somewhat similar. Main two to three champs for your main role and 1-2 for your off role. If you get auto filled dodge until you feel like you have enough experience to adequately manage an off role lane. When it comes to champs you want to main find high elo streamers that one trick and learn from them they are usually very informative. I will say jng is probably one of the hardest roles to main however because you have to be so flexible in your picks you cannot have just one or two, but mid you should have no trouble with that. Then it just comes down to play experience. Hope my advice coming from a trash can helps.

Also, o.p. obviously doesn't  feel like it fits or else the post wouldn't be here. If the diagnosis is correct, a second doc would agree. If it is wrong, then the new doctor may catch that. If you are in the field, why caution people against second opinions?

Hey!  I was about to build my own bridge soon but I'm waiting on a response from the support team on this question.  Maybe you can tell me the answer since you have access to a bridge and multiple sentinels.   (Here's what I sent them below)  I'm wondering if I link my sentinel to my bridge at home, then take it away from the bridge if it still functions. In your support article you mention for an example, placing the sentinel in a train station, to do this I obviously can't just hook up a bridge in the train station without violating a law or two, so does this mean my sentinel if left alone (after being paired) will still collect geo mines for me even though it's not near my phone or bridge? How does the data get passed along stating I own part of that mine if my bridge and phone are not near?  My assumption is that the Sentinel has a procedure where through bluetooth it identifies itself and uses the miner's data to relay that part of the geomine is owned by the sentinel owner. But I'm not really sure. Could you give me a more detailed breakdown?

If you are a complete novice then I would recommend putting at least 50% into an ETF or Index Fund such as $SPY or $VOO which invests in a large collection of the top companies on the stock market (Apple, Facebook, Google, Exxon, Johnson and Johnson, McDonalds, etc.).  It‚Äôs a great way to add some stability and long term growth (hold it until you‚Äôre ready for retirement, just don‚Äôt touch it) and you can usually outperform most investors but just following the entire index of the stock market this way. Very few individual stock picks outperform the S&amp;P 500

&gt;In 10 years (or less) the Green Party will take over the NDP as party #3.  Can't speak for OP, but that sounds pretty terrible to me to have the top three parties being anti-labour. I still don't see that happening though. Green haven't even passed Bloc yet.  The Greens have historically been irrelevant in this riding and the NDP has long been a strong contender, so NDP is still a much safer bet if you're looking to unseat the LPC.
Hmm, that's a general statement and I'm not really seeing any evidence to suggest that those kids made it up.   A general statement or assumption about people and then applying it arbitrarily is not very strong. In contrast, there is photo evidence of Jared sexting with a minor..   What I'm getting at is *there's more evidence he was up to bad things then there is evidence his accusers were lying*, see what I mean?

That‚Äôs the law tho? Like that‚Äôs a law you agreed to follow when you accepted your license.   If the person in front of you is going 54 mph in a 55 mph, you‚Äôd have to speed to pass them safely.

But if you do in front of a cop, you can‚Äôt exactly argue with them if they give you a ticket. Even if the law seems arbitrary, it‚Äôs still the law all drivers are supposed to follow.

To be honest, i have ran it for testing on 3700x/x370  AMD did say about 7 and Ryzen 'If it worked before, it will work again.'  Using modded x570 usb chipset drivers and sha-1 sign them to avoid BSODs. And avoid certain updates, not because of telemetry but because they bsod.  Using latest AMD drivers too, it worked very well, smooth and even got same or better FPS with more perceived smoothness at max settings CS:Go. Windows 10 does have issues that we do not notice all the time. However, 7 while EOL officially is not an XP, its a diff codebase than 10 which is made to be unify everything. Instead, if you want to run it, run it, just be aware you have to be cautious and smart.  Zen 2 is officially listed on Wikipedia as immune to Spectre, so i doubt the stuff is that exploitable, its just the OS is old AF (but gold for 10 years kicking. It just works.)  I am not easily encouraging this, not for faint hearted, however i am now on LTSC. I hate when companies push us to update when there is no need, because i am using LTSC and newer drivers crash my Vega in spite of the hardware being all good, driver crash due to WDDM probably. If Win10 can unify, why not solitify choices and wdm

I volunteered in one that‚Äôs fairly local and read some stuff there as well.

Hi i just wanted to ask about the state of the Game, last time i played i think It was the first tidus (relics?) Event i dont remember the name but you know the rng hell where you can farm for 24h and still get only shitty ones.  I want to go back to the game new account etc, is It a good time?

It's bullshit, I'm a veteran. If it's a civilian version or a replication of the MRE, it isn't an MRE. They're regularly \~$5 at the commissary, or free if you're active duty, real MRE's are typically around 1250-1500 calories these days. The shit you're getting anywhere else, very simply, isn't an MRE.  &amp;#x200B;  If they're genuine then I covered those conditions above. They're not commercially sold by Sopakco, you cannot buy genuine MRE's as a civilian.  &amp;#x200B;  It's like saying there's no difference between Post's Cocoa Pebbles and Safeway's Cocoa Nuggets. No, that's stupid. One is the genuine article and one's a knock off. Similar isn't the same. You'd be a moron who can't deal in nuance if you thought that. I'm sure you're a moron, paying $15 for a $5 product, but you're not all together dumb are you?

A knife and anything that is used to kill is a killing machin. From the beginning of time and human history man has always wanted to have weapons for self-defense. They always wanted the best weapons possible. If a group of sick rapist cunts are invading my house and I have my beautiful wife and kids is it bad I would rather have an AK-47 then a simple handgun? I would want to destroy those sick fucks with the better weapon I am confident in using. Again if you actually read my post, I said I can live with an assault rifle ban or whatever, but I can‚Äôt stand you anti- gun smartasses thinking you are smarter than everyone else. You just want to not take blame for why America has these shootings. If you want change understand why the NRA and gun owners want to keep their guns. You treat fun owners like devils. It won‚Äôt work. If we want change we need small changes first like better security or gun ales that won‚Äôt take any weapon for now. I agree in better background checks and laws tbh. Hopefully government takes action.

Murder his ex wife and a waiter, then wrote a book about it after he was acquitted.
&gt;The Bible is calling out rape and male prostitution, not a loving relatiomship between two men.  Actually no, it is quite clearly not.  &gt;The term Paul used that is translated 'homosexual(s)' came directly from the two Greek words in the Greek translation of the Levitical passage (i.e. the Septuagint, which Paul quoted regularly) condemning homosexuality. Paul "coined" the compound word, but it did not come from a vacuum. The Septuagint's translation of the Levitical passage says, in effect, "Don't 'bed' [koite] a 'man' [arseno] like you would a woman." Hence, arsenokoites.  &gt;Neither did Paul contextualize the act confining it to prostitution or child abuse or pagan idolatry. If he did, and if the author of Leviticus did as well, then a consistent hermeneutic requires that the neighboring sins these texts condemn would only be prohibited in the same context, but would be acceptable otherwise. So incest, murder of a child, adultery, and bestiality are permissible as long as they are practiced outside of the context of prostitution or pagan idolatry. This is obviously an untenable position.  &gt;See Romans 1:26-27 where the condemnation of homosexuality does not depend on the translation of a word coined by Paul in his other writings. In the Romans passage, Paul lists men and women abandoning the natural sexual act (heterosexuality) for what is unnatural (homosexuality) as an example of man's abominations resulting from abandoning the truth of God in exchange for a lie, as Paul describes it.  &gt;Some have suggested over the years that Paul was referring in Romans to people abandoning their sexual orientation, and that the word "natural" refers to what is natural for those individuals and not natural in the context of the created order. But this notion is defective, since the plain structure of the Greek words Paul chose forces the translation of "the" natural function rather than "their" natural function. In other words, there is no possessive usage (i.e. "ho autos physikos") which would translate "their natural..." but instead a direct non-possessive syntax ("ho physikos") is used.  &gt;Furthermore, the idea that in the Romans passage Paul was describing "sexual orientation" and therefore what is natural to the individual as opposed to the created order, is defeated by the claim coming from the same sources that sexual orientation as we "know" it today is a concept Paul was unfamiliar with.  &gt;Paul clearly condemned homosexual practice singularly regardless of the context in which it may be practiced. Paul may not have been aware of the concept of loving committed same-sex relationships, but that is only relevant if you reject the claim that he was writing God's Word under God's wisdom, inspiration, and guidance. If the Christian claim that Paul was writing what God intended is true, we must consider whether God in his omniscience was aware of the modern concept we are discussing. If one regards the Biblical text as the eternal Word of God as most Christians do, it is reasonable to give credence to the idea that the text would address future possibilities and clear up what would certainly be a potent question for our day.

The thing is the mob mentality always existed and we tolerated when it promoted something that was convenient and aligned to our standard of morality. Basically, as long as it was for a good cause, it was good, right?  Some racist and homophobic members of families were mobbed out by the whole family into accepting their son's or daughter's companion. They were literally shamed into align with the progressive standard.That was mobbing mentality. The racist member was forced to accept it.   It was good that it happened, and it fueled further improvements fro society, but let's not pretend that we good guys, didn't use the same tactics.  Now that we discover that even racist and bigots and homophobic people can adopt the same tactics against us, we're all going Pikachu Face Gasp.

I mean, would you want half of a stranger's burger? I get what you're saying, but it really makes homeless people feel less than human when offered food no "normal" person would consume.   I understand the mentality of "if I give them money, they'll just spend it on booze or drugs", though I don't fully agree. And honestly, being homeless is shitty, I don't mind being the one that allows them to forget that for a few hours. That's a totally different subject, and I do fully understand the other side.   But don't offer half eaten food. Seriously. That's more insulting than saying no. If you have an extra burger that hasn't been touched, that's fine to offer. But don't offer something you yourself wouldn't accept from a stranger. The homeless are people too.  Edit: The homeless are a huge target for hate. I mean, who wants them hanging around? Food that has obviously been opened and consumed, is not only dehumanizing, but presents a real risk of being tampered with.   I've seen insulin needles, spit, semen, dirt, urine, shit, and any other horrible thing being put in obviously opened or half eaten food being offered to the homeless. People are awful, and no one knows that better than the homeless population. They're right to be wary, even minus the feeling of getting scraps meant for the dogs.

Thank you for sharing your story. There‚Äôs a lot there that sounds achingly familiar.   In addition to the other suggestions, you might try simple mindfulness meditation. It can be extremely helpful in unpacking subconscious biases/beliefs that may be causing you to suffer and in helping you‚Äôre mind step back from the clamor and chaos that‚Äôs going on in all our heads. 10 minutes a day can be a good starting point.  And focus on self care as much as you can. From my experience, if it feels like your starting to overdo it, you‚Äôre probably just getting close to where you should be üòâ  Ok, now for a rant.   You mentioned you‚Äôre a software developer and your having to work in noisy environments. So I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre working in an ‚Äúopen office‚Äù Agile‚Ñ¢Ô∏è workspace that is supposed to ‚Äúincrease productivity‚Äù and ‚Äúreduce development rework‚Äù. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôm so sorry. The research shows that‚Äôs this is all bullshit, but companies continue to build these ASD-hostile environments because it reduces their rent cost by cutting space per employee. But telling developers they‚Äôre being packed into veal pens to save money so management can reach their bonus targets doesn‚Äôt go over well. So the snake oil continues to flow and we continue to suffer. And BTW, did you ever notice that the people making the decision to implement these human-hostile work environments still keep their private offices?  If you can find a place that‚Äôs taken this cost cutting strategy to its logical conclusion and allows devs to work from home, that might be a good place to work. Even if the pay is lower.

Yup, most of these polls show that people want stricter gun control but there's usually way less consensus on exactly how. That's why I was surprised about this one being so unified about the background checks one.

I'll explain see I told him that there's no skill playing a mobile game(you're still free to enjoy it) this hurt his ego that he decided to troll poorly i might add. Not sure why he mentions me when he's too spineless to debate. At this point redundancy is no longer an understatement.
This is too easy.   Take the lowest state population; they get one seat in the house.  The lowest states population always equals one seat.  If your state has 20x the population of the lowest state, your state gets 20 seats.  Easily adjusted every 10 years.

For me I like a lot of yangs line of thought but disagree with several things, however for the freedom dividend is THE issue for me that separates the two and puts Yang over Bernie.   I‚Äôve been a supporter of UBI since I got into politics and for me it‚Äôs THE policy that would do so much for everyone regardless of circumstance. It can singlehandedly end poverty and the existential dread that comes with it, it will drastically strengthen minorities and workers, it separates human worth from salary earning occupations, it will significantly cushion any effects of future recession, it will give the average person true economic freedom, and it will let people take needed and necessary risks like starting families and businesses.   There isn‚Äôt another policy that does so much while at the same time being so simple in operation.   For me personally it would mean me and my wife could without financial fear start a family like we‚Äôve always dreamed of; we could take time off to go back to college since we both got shafted by local universities; buy our own home; cut back on our work hours since we‚Äôve both had to work overtime just to meet the basics

I made sure the shoelaces didn‚Äôt have slack to reach the brake/tire, but the backpack kept sliding off the the side, and had to keep readjusting it.

This was a last minute decision for me so I just improvised, and rather not wear the backpack.  The food was amazing, I have friends that went before and always recommended it.

Both are Vaporesso mods, the one on the left is the Vaporesso Gen. It takes two external 18650 batteries and if you are looking to go from pods to a box mod, this will serve you very well. The default mode on it is basically set for a "plug and play" kind of setup, where you really dont have to fiddle with any settings to get a solid vape. It includes all the other traditional features that you will no doubt get curious about and will want to try out as well.  That being said, I reckon there are going to be many more experienced people on here with other, possibly better suggestions when it comes to a first box mod when first switching from pods, but as far as build quality and overall user satisfaction is concerned, I personally stand by vaporesso products, and this one in particular is one of their best to date in my opinion.  If you are completely new to vaping with box mods I would suggest you just look into how your juice, particularly nicotine strength will change; as well as proper battery safety, as these will be your two biggest variables.  As a P.S. for your purposes, you may want to look into the Vaporesso Podstick as well, maybe watch a review, just to see if that kind of thing is not more in line with your current needs.  Enjoy the vape journey my friend :)

This is a global head-scratcher by the looks of it. No council or health department will give you a yes or a no or any sort of handholding. The onus is on you to know the practices. I found being transparent, proactive, and keep a paper trail with department authorities. Also, knowing what your doing is a huge plus.  Making test batchers 9-12 months before you go loud and proud public about the product gave me a lot of confidence in my system and practices.
I know you said you tried vaping, but have you tried a pen like a juul? When I quit I got a vape with a tank and used the hell out of it, which is the opposite of cutting down.   With the pen I can't rip fat clouds and just do it until I feel good and stop. Juul pods also hit like a fucking truck and I only needed a few puffs to be good to go. Apparently they have some kind of chemical in them that makes it hit your system faster.  It's really not at all the same as the tank, and after a year I barely use the thing.  Just saying, might be worth a shot.

Um it wouldn't work if you used it on police... I think you may not be understanding fully the strategy being discussed here?  The point is to tag people that they don't want to arrest so that they won't arrest people. Police are already going to obviously be assumed to have gotten blue dye on them at the protest where dye was being launched... that doesn't change anything.  It ONLY works if applied to innocents who the police will think twice about and thus abandon persecution of.  In the process saving lots more innocent people, hopefully. In the meantime, any wrongdoing would still be on the police's hands for each and every person they do anything to without actual evidence and due process. Blue dye is not harm other than ruining a shirt. DECIDING as a CHOICE to round people up with non-evidentiary blue dye is harm. The police are and would be doing all of the harm there either way.  Blue dye in this context is textbook nonviolent resistance  --------  Your argument is the equivalent of saying "Back when black people got lynched regularly in the American south, having your parents move in with you from another state, as a black person, should be considered a violent act tantamount to attempted murder or extreme negligence toward your parents by exposing them to possible lynching"

Great work Mack!  Thanks for what you did for the horns!
Thought I would share.  I, too, have seen fairies.   I lived in Georgia (still live super close by but now in Florida) and we had a lot of woods surrounding the house.   The first time I saw one was while swinging over at the property my father owned across from our house. I was on the phone with a friend one night and I saw this ENORMOUS orange colored ball of light fly through the trees at the edge of the woods and disappear. I don‚Äôt remember it as well as I would like but I know it was huge. I remember staring speechless at the woods while my friend kept talking but I wasn‚Äôt listening because I was so stunned by what I‚Äôd seen.  I‚Äôm sure I told her about it but I don‚Äôt think she thought much of it.   The second time was even more amazing and you‚Äôll understand why I‚Äôm sure. This sighting happened in the woods at my house. I was walking up our driveway and saw a tinier orange orb of light floating above the ground near the edge of the woods. It was like the first light, just a lot smaller. Miniature. I was tempted to try and grab it (I read in a storybook once that if you catch a fairy it will grant a wish) but scared because I‚Äôd also read that if you touch a fairy it will curse you.  This is the part that makes this experience so much more amazing- a black cat that we had at the time  ALSO saw the fairy. It was watching it and reached up to swat at it. Right before it‚Äôs paw could make contact the orb disappeared. It instantly VANISHED. Gone without a trace.   It‚Äôs so wild that I almost can‚Äôt believe it happened but it did.   I‚Äôve also seen a will ‚Äòo the wisp. I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it even was until a friend suggested it and I looked it up and it totally fit the description of what I‚Äôd seen. We had a swampy area at the edge of our property so it made a lot of sense, that‚Äôs that also the direction it headed in.  I haven‚Äôt seen a fairy like the one you have, but I don‚Äôt doubt for a second that the orbs I saw were fairies. I think maybe the big orb was a group of them or a Queen. But I have no idea. What I saw definitely weren‚Äôt fire flies, because I‚Äôm sure someone might think such a thing. What I saw was totally different and a light that was almost blinding and intensely colored.

What does this even mean?
Omg! My niece was bullied when she was in elementary, I really wanted to go beat those kids up, let them know how much things hurt. If I knew where they lived I would have. Nothing would have stopped me and I would be in jail. But it has affected her entire school life she's 17 now, not being bullied, but not making friends either. She's alone and it breaks my heart. It literally makes me tear up. The act of a bunch of stupid children ruined my nieces school life. She's carried that with her all this time she can't forget it. And she is the nicest girl. She wants World Peace she doesn't understand why people fight, she doesn't get why everyone just doesn't like each other , it just doesn't make sense to her.

The outcome depends a great deal on the exact nature of how your poor victim is dispatched.  How thoroughly does the aggressor "shreds this person to pieces"?  A lot of automobile and industrial accidents produce results that may fit this description.  I'm not suggesting you go research the dark web for graphic examples.  But you might want to consider whether the coup de grace is a quick and violent administration or fueled by sustained rage.  If the latter, your "very strong alien" might very well be beating a meat pudding incapable of twitching, choking, or gasping.  It all comes down to how you actually want to write it.

Read the post again.. there‚Äôs a clue üßê
Yeah, I‚Äôm starting to feel that way with Andoran. I _wanted_ to make a fantasy Republic floating in the sky, like Columbia but not evil. With its enemies a collection of monarchs below. With Andoran being so detailed and interesting though, I‚Äôm hard pressed to detail the Republic in ways that feel more compelling.
That‚Äôs heartwarming and insightful! I thought it‚Äôd be some kind of insidious idea or secret that Union was hiding, given there‚Äôs a passcode. But that‚Äôs nice too.

That's pretty hardcore. I will only buy a vehicle that I can upgrade the way I want. But I've never bought a car to fit a box before.

Barely any experience though. Like 30-50 passes total.
I‚Äôve seen him and his band a number of times and they perfectly encapsulate that opaque and squishy sound they do on record. Often periods of times between songs where the band would just jam, drink liquor, smoke, and walk around the stage feeling each other up. It‚Äôs bizarre, but such a mood, I wouldn‚Äôt expect anything else from them.   They played just about everything I wanted to hear last time, really tightly too. It was a mixture of old and new, along with a couple of Soft Hair songs.
I really wonder what will happen to china when all this is over. Will all the cops be executed or jailed? Or will they keep going on the street even with the old government gone? And if they get executed and such, who‚Äôs job is it to help china remain peaceful?
I absolutely love these kids. Funny or not.

Hello darkness my old friend...  But for real that better be jitters, k thanx do better
Thanks, asdvn...! I just discovered that this WWI draft reg card is almost certainly not my great uncle's, because it lists as his wife a woman I never heard of.   I know from family lore that his wife's name was Anna. According to US Census records, likely less accurate than his daughter's mortuary obituary, wife Anna was American born of Polish parents. But the obituary says she was born in Poland and gives her full maiden name as Anna Zwieszawska Rinski.  Does that name make sense to you? I can't find it in any US records other than that obituary, so I think it was changed or mid-transliterated in the US.

This is an excellent way of diffusing the situation.

Have many people posting here even read further than the first few paragraphs?

This place is lost; it's merely a public opinion bending machine now. I got wrecked the other day for suggesting that www.shareblue.com isn't a news source.

Half and half. Jon is undeniably excellent, but were he in a more competitive/skilled division I doubt he'd be undefeated or look nearly as impressive as he has. Put someone with his skills and his build (by the standards of a division) into say LW and he'd likely be another of the many elite top guys.

This is what happened in Illinois.   Target Retail Corporation received some sweet tax money in exchange for jobs. Illinois had to sue because of the lack of jobs.

Hi friend!!
This is basically my exact feelings about it. They shouldn't have split it between two continents. Doma and Ala Mhigo are just so different, it felt like neither place got its due screentime (and I think Ala Mhigo suffered more for it than Doma did.)  Doma almost felt like it was *robbing* Ala Mhigo of its moment in the sun, after we've been hearing about its mad king, the monks, the lore about the war, the Garlean oppression, and dealing with Ala Mhigan refugees for years and years beforehand. Doma also had lore about it and obviously refugees as well, but the crisis just felt so far away as compared to the actual bordering neighbor of a major city we already had access to.

Yeah is much easier on hair and skin and your bathing suit! üòâ. Also doesn‚Äôt smell too much. The salt taste depends on how much salt is in the pool. I usually add salt to open a new season (salt gets lost when backwashing the filter or splashing etc during the year. Each chlorinator needs a certain amount of salt) and so it can get saltier. When I use the gym pool I have to soap scrub my skin more to get rid of the chlorine smell than when I use the salt pool. I wish the gym had it.
I think the new one is GREAT!

Pretty sure Apple tried to pull this about jailbraking phones. They said that you don't own the phone and your paying for the right to use it, and when you jailbrake it you forfeit that right. How ever when this was taken to the high court it ended pretty quickly with the court pretty much being like that's bullshit the purchase the phone and the now own it thus can legally do whatever they want.  (this is not exact in terms of details but I'm pretty sure it's close)

Yeah, if a federal agent catches you with weed in a state where it‚Äôs legal, they can still arrest you. However if police on the state level catch you with it, they can‚Äôt do anything.

Hmm. Many of the ashbitten to outsiders are well, there species name is used in some phrases. Withstanding stupid amounts of things, a glutton for punishment like an ashbitten for instance, due to their tendency to both get hurt and shrug off said injury. Civilized barbarians is a nickname for their race, amongst others. Outside their race, your generally left guessing. To them, it‚Äôs relatively obvious the goal generally, not necessarily the means, unless the two ashbitten know each other a bit better. One notable example while he was still alive(relatively recent history), gained the nickname as the Drone‚Äôs Blade. A bounty hunter, with a ship with tech stolen from a brief war, giving it lasers meant for closer to a (forgetting ship classes, uh, what‚Äôs smaller than a capital ship, but larger than a personal fighter craft? Like mid teir size) akwardly mounted to the bottom of his craft, and a stolen reactor to power it. The reason for the drone part of his nickname, is unlike most ashbitten who will fight with a bone knife or shorter range when out of their ship, he has drones. (If you‚Äôve watched guardians of the galaxy, remember that arrow?). Well, these ones shoot lasers normally, however he has some built for repair or disassembly of whatever he attacks. And they are effective. Couple with an actual sidearm instead of a knife, and an effective killer.   Later on, however it seemed he got a little...erratic. He would go and help here, on a planet he‚Äôs never set foot on, halfway across the galaxy, while a similar mess is far closer. The bounties? He‚Äôd occasionally leave before being paid. Not all that abnormal for an ashbitten getting enough scrap out of the wreckage, except he left that too. Rare at most for ashbitten. Other times, he‚Äôd demand far more money. Pirates? Sometimes he‚Äôd go out of his way, seemingly with an old grudge, no matter how far out of his way it was, not that he was lacking reasons. To outsiders, they aren‚Äôt known to always seem to have the clearest train of thought, but he was worse than normal. I mean, he generally seemed to be doing good, but it was random how he seemed to. Now he never had clear logic truthfully, but, it generally had seemingly some reason. This planet was closer/worse off/I‚Äôve been there before, so I‚Äôll help them. Or some vague train of thought. Last anyone saw of him, he seemed to have been pursuing *something* but it‚Äôs unclear what.
And he'll get blamed like he did last time

So true. I met a Dom from a kink site and at some point during our preliminary talks he noticed artistic cutting in my list of things I was curious about. He never mentioned it to me, just decided to do some non-negotiated, non-consensual knife play while he had me tied up and blindfolded. I still have scars.
I desperately wanted to upvote this comment but you went out of your way to misspell their.
Lol.  Yes me choosing her approval rating during her run for President is ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù but you looking at the graph and choosing an approval rating from 2012 isn‚Äôt cherry picking.  Edit: I‚Äôm sure you saw but she hit under 50% approval in every decade and often for long periods of time. She also went under 50% when she ran in 2008.  Was it Russian influence in the early 90s when she was under 40%? What about her low approval ratings in the mid 90s? The Russians? 2007? The Russians?

You can tell your parents you have something important to talk to them about. Bring up your past crying breakdowns and say you‚Äôve been trying to brush it off as hormones but you know it‚Äôs something more. You can tell them about hitting yourself and that you need help. It‚Äôs not something you control yourself anymore. You don‚Äôt know whether to go to your doctor first or ask for a therapist. And then ask them for help with this.  Probably see your doctor and get screened for depression and probably want to make an appointment to see a psychiatrist. Your parents hopefully can help you with all this.

Excited to see the console releases! I bought Switch version.  There is no dpad movement enabled in menus, you need to move the cursor with the analog stick like a mouse pointer. Definitely should update this to dpad menus.  The UI scaling on switch seems too small and hard to read.  I wanted to use keyboard and mouse after trying the controller-based aim and shooting. Definitely think this is another area to improve for console players.

What is the clicking about?
The original EU Thrawn series (5 books) is pretty great and an interesting comparison to the new canon Thrawn material (his appearances in Rebels plus 3 books).
I found one workaround right after posting, but it's not ideal (and not really the type of solution I was looking for), but:  Switch to session view and type in a new tempo (different than the tempo at the current timeline position). This will cause the "Re-enable Automation" button to light up and the tempo automation to be disabled. Then adjust back to the original tempo, work in session view, and press "Re-enable Automation" when finished to restore the global tempo track.  I was hoping for something more along the lines of a preference/setting, single press of a transport mode/button, etc, so I hope there's something that's more of a single step. Switching the tempo when going back to Session view each time, switching it back to work, and then returning it is a little slow/cumbersome. I suppose you could also set the arrangement loop markers to an area without any tempo changes, but this is also a multi-click/multi-step process.
how did you make this?
Sorry for the super late reply! I had a big family event all day today and I just got home.  All of the beauty Blenders are still available. Your total for the black and pink would be $22 shipped.

I guess the main thing I'm worried about as I'm having little twinges of pain and soreness a few hours after the incident- should I call back and demand copies of camera footage? They didn't give me any paperwork but took all my info on the back of an incident report sheet. I spoke to a manager and know his name, at the customer service desk where i'm sure there's cameras (and I'm sure there is footage of my fall as well). My roommate went back to take pictures of the area when I was talking to the manager but they already had wet floor signs up. I feel like maybe I didn't handle this properly as it was quickly after the incident and I was kind of adrenaline rush freaked out at the time. I just want to make sure I don't end up screwed over.

Yes, it binds stronger to the receptor, but since it's a partial agonist it doesn't produce as strong of a response at the receptor compared with the original substance (e.g. heroin, a full agonist).

Simplify everything! What is the most likely things you will need, can you use one answer for multiple questions, are there certain phrases, case studies etc that are multi-purpose  When I look at anything to study I always think how you can cross reference, it shows a greater understanding of the topic and it lessons everything you have to learn  An example would be studying Volcanoes (Geography) not only do they answer the physical strand (plate tectonics) but also human strand (displacement, impact on life, settlement patterns) and economic geography (green energy, farming on the soils provided) and so on. One topic to answer multiple questions, reducing overall stress of it all

When I was 18 my bff of 10 years and I had our falling out, and it was huge. I had been talking to this guy for months and dated him for a little under a month and he unfortunately passed away tragically. He was my first love, he was absolutely amazing, 13 years later I still miss him. She sided with her then boyfriend that there's no way I could love someone that fast. Yet she was in a love triangle with her x and her on again off again verbally abusive boyfriend. So she's totally ok to love two guys and of course she loved them after like a week each, yet when it comes to me she and her boyfriend know when I should and shouldn't love someone. It ended out 10 year friendship and she ruined my boyfriends favorite shirt by having her boyfriend and x boyfriend masturbate onto it, among other things.

'Into the Spiderverse' is IMO the best Spider-man movie so far. I'm not a 'Sony will ruin Spider-man!' person. They've made good/great Spider-man movies in the past, though Tobey's third and Andrew's second were notoriously mucked up due to Sony Studio interference. But if Sony hires the same creative team (they have Holland &amp; the writers, so hopefully they'll get Watts again too) and leaves them alone that would help.   But I fear that Sony will try to bog Tom's third movie down with a dozen tie ins to their SMU verse and future Sinister Six plans. But even if Sony don't immediately push that agenda, the creative team will be hampered with working around the MCU ties and it won't be the part 3 it could've been.
I would've been very okay if he was the QB we took in our class last year, you guys got a good one
Max CPU is dual Xeon X5365s. I‚Äôm not 100% sure of the GPU, but I know it can run a GTX 960 with no problem (other than it only being PCIe 1.1 and not 3.0)  Edit: also RAM I‚Äôve had 24 GB of 667 MHz DDR2 with no issues on my dual X5365 machine. I‚Äôm pretty sure they can go up to 64GB with the dual CPUs.

Back then they often wove loved ones' locks of hair into jewelry.  The Victorians did it a lot.  And as someone else said, wearing a ring made out of some dead person's hair = **ick**.
If it‚Äôs custom to remove a bowl flair after the season, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd put a golden hat flair on?
&gt;Nope  Yes, this was believed by Gnostics. Its part of a neoplatonic Christian synthesize called Gnosticism.   &gt;Classical, as in Nicene, we can agree on that definition.  Yes, but also the ante nicene era as well.   &gt;In the Gospels while in this universe for sure. However a physical body would not be taken to the level of Heaven where Jesus would be.  I suppose we don't really know, but that seems like an unnecessary box to put God in to say that His deified body is not able to do as such.   Another reason why I think it is unlikely is that we are being who will both be physically resurrected and live on the new earth, while also partaking in the divine nature. If we can do it, I'm sure that Christ can do it as well right now.
Its not about being proud about not knowing their name dude its about these shooters are allegedly trying to get famous but for every mass shooting that continues to happen nobody is gonna know their names at the end of the day.

If you have your nightclub upgraded, id recommend getting more MC businesses or a bunker! I love being able to make money passively while I play through the nightclub. And the sell missions are super easy imo.
Good luck to your preferred candidate.  I think you forgot, though, that many, many Trump voters would have voted for Bernie. They really liked Sanders. Once Clinton was the nominee, they voted for Trump.  If Bernie is the nominee, those voters may come back in high numbers to support a change candidate.

So...you'd rather have more Trump? Just because your own personal feelings were hurt three years ago, and you didn't win?   I'm sure the children in Trump's concentration camps will understand. Your "message" to the establishment is totally more important than putting an end to this criminal monster.

A real rebuild, just sit back and watch.
I've been thinking, honestly, that they could get a LOT of mileout out of letting you eventually migrate characters from Classic servers to a BC server and then Wrath and so on.  Basically, letting you play through that content "when it was fresh" and as long as you want. But, then, being able to move forward and progress your character.  Maybe even, eventually, all the way to Retail if someone actually wanted to do that?  *shrugs*  That said, I do think that classic has at least a bit more vitality than a lot of people are assuming. In a lot of ways, Classic has a lot of depth that didn't really get carried over to live,- it won't last FOREVER but I can easily see it going for a long time,-
not a book, but Legion, the TV series, on FX. What‚Äôs brilliant about this series is it‚Äôs up to the audience to decide which protagonist is becoming the villain.
I am a fucking terrible person i just know how to hide it i swear to god im gonna end up in prison, its like im scared, i dont even wanna tell my relatives or friends, imagine if your closest friend told you that he has had a *LOT* of toughts about brutally murdering him just because, you wouldnt feel very comfortable, would you?
i have schizophrenic disorder, sometimes i see things i want to see. I can imagine something someone told me, althought it can be false

Not really starting to slip. These had a lot more hand crafting than the mass production guns. Things like a slight tilt to a stamping weren't considered an imperfection.
There's a comment in this thread that shows Irma's projected path from all models vs it's actual path. Even though I'm up in NE Florida I know i'm still being extremely cautious. Hearing anyone in state dropping their guard gives me further anxiety.

No. The slap scene was meant to be a moment of levity in a chaotic situation. It had nothing to do with Tifa's "strength". It should stay.

To be fair, that was a fanatics branded version, the picture is shitty quality. We all say the same thing about new jerseys every year regardless of team. It looks awful in pictures when they‚Äôre flat, but once they‚Äôre on a player it‚Äôs a whole new story.   Perfect example: Carolina‚Äôs alt this year  Edit: Meaning Carolina‚Äôs Black Alts from 2018-2019

I wasn't impressed with him. He played hard but did some bonehead shit too. Almost got a targeting call, was leading with his head on a few other plays. Overall for being so experienced not a great day for him.
Any tips so I can too succeed
Honestly I only recognize a few of these as having felt them. My range of emotion seems to be very short. The only time I think I‚Äôve felt happy is when I‚Äôm on drugs. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs happiness though.

I would interpret that you can choose between the Hallway or Cellar. If you choose the Cellar, for the duration of the investigation you are considered to be there, so you would take the the damage and horror for the tablet reveal and also be able to use Agnes' reaction.  Although following the same interpretation should also mean that the Ghoul would engage Agnes and move to her threat area as soon as she chooses the Cellar. She would not suffer an attack of opportunity, since the action was initiated before the engagement.  Seems "as if" needs clarification to me as most everyone else is taking it differently than I am.
:D nice. Thank you.

I'm thinking that. But they state that there are excellent chances of becoming a full-time analyst.
First of all I never said if I was a man or a woman so your comment makes no sense. And no I meant I‚Äôm tired of trying to give evidence to mgtows or future mgtows and red pillers who don‚Äôt go outside enough to see the world isn‚Äôt black and white. Everyone gets indecisive, every gender has shot people and good people. Key word is ‚Äúboth‚Äù  Like I‚Äôm literally so tired of it. I have given studies after studies to people like you but you guys never actually read them or open your minds so I‚Äôm done putting effort in because I want to enjoy Reddit instead of dealing with sexist people. I also have a lot of subs I need to mod and this nonsense is taking up time. So I don‚Äôt really think you‚Äôre worth the time

That's so cool never knew they had that.

That's cool.  I like it when real improvements are still made to existing products.  I've some software which got a market dominant position and hasn't made a single improvement in 15 years or so.  Doesn't even support copy and paste properly, requires JVM.  Laziest scalping developers.
That's cool and all but everybody's seen this countless times
Optus Stadium has restricted viewing. I think some of them are seated right next to an aisle wall. Some have the metal fence bar right in your face. Some might be behind camera operators.  I bought some restricted viewing at Adelaide oval this year too. They were level two on the wing for a great price but they had the TV camera right in front. Turns out he completely blocked our view LoL. But luckily some nice members had friends who didn't show up so they let us sit there instead.
