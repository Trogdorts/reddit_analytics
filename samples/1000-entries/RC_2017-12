All my buddies love Pacific Rim and always talk about it. They are always telling me to watch it because "the action is awesome". I never really have the time though, and when I do- I usually watch something that appeals to me more.
sounds like coil whine , when playing cities skylines, maybe turn on vsync and see if it stops.  lot of time a card will max it self out past the refresh rate can cause this. or limit the fps to what your monitors max is.   this is no indication of GPU dyin. just the power phase coils working at a frequency that is in the human register.

The anti-circumcision movement has been called anti-semitic, the call to end honor culture has been called racist and the question about depression-related outcomes of same sex parrents has been called homophobic. Al those things are umbrella terms, sometimes used properly but often used in an ill-defined manner in trying to stifle discourse.   Flat earth society is a satire, quite brilliant.

Sadly those server only need the EPYC 7251 at $475 MSRP (those are fully featured, like the $4000 7601, but with 8 core / 16 thread) So even if each order 10,000 servers  * 7 = 70,000 unit at 475 MSRP . most lilkely sold for $400, at 60% margin =  22 million in profit.  And thats only if ALL seven,  Google, Baidu, Amazon, tensent, etc... each order 10,000 servers... (To get 22 million profit for AMD)  There is little money for the CPU manufacturer in storage servers. most of the money goes into the storage devices.

I would try not to worry about it so much. I'm sure Mary doesn't want you to. Just try to develop a healthy prayer life, and don't be overly worried if you're not devoted to the right people.

There's a right time for everything and forcing it isn't going to get you anywhere.

And it doesn't work. At least it doesn't seem like it works.   Edit: on ps4 at least. 
It sounds like your opponent is running a Clickbait-style deck, that makes you run a taxing remote over and over again in case it's an agenda. There's no real trick to playing against them, apart from maybe finding out what's in HQ and R&amp;D through lots of accesses early in the game while it's still cheap. But the real trick is learning your opponent's tells so you know when it's a QPM, when it's a Beale, and when it's a Keegan.  At some point, however, you're going to have to stop playing his game, because his remote will be taxing enough to wreck you if you run it every turn. Hopefully, that's before the corp is at game point, because at that point you HAVE to check everything. But if you can set up and make enough money before that (not hard as Maxx), you can just put your Medium down and start hammering R&amp;D. At that point you'll probably just stop bothering with clearing tags and just run through his tagging ice. Assuming he's not already at 6 points and you score the final Quantum Predictive Kitty for him, you can win that way. Resistors (and Data Ward, if they have one) are the only ones that will get more taxing when you're tagged, but you could kill them with Parasite or cutlery before you go tag-me. Or Femme them, as others said.  The trick is knowing WHEN to go YOLO and start taking tags. Do you have enough money to make 3-4 Medium runs a turn until you win? Is he already holding a Beale in hand? Cause if he is, he could find a Psychographics and win in one. Is Exchange of Information a risk? Can you survive a Closed Accounts and still make enough money to keep running? Do you have a spare clone chip or deja vu so you can recur a key breaker that you lose to Keegan?
I see this in many of my own students.  It's a shame, because I can't make all the connections for you.  I have to teach what I have time for during my lectures.  I do my best at it, but there's significant time pressure.  The homework and other exercises are designed to help you connect up what you do in class.  I can't guarantee your institution does a great job of this, but mine does pretty well.  The best advice I can give you is to just keep at the material, and practice a lot.  With introductory math courses like calculus, repetition of doing things like integrals and derivatives are important.  Maybe if you're in calc 2, looking at a lot of sequences, series, and practicing parametrizing curves over and over again would be helpful.  It seems like students just think their instructors magically understand the stuff.  It's quite the opposite.  For me, I had many classes, mostly in physics, that built up my knowledge on calculus and mathematical methods for problem solving.  Just for example, you will do roughly triple the integration in calc 3 just by the sheer fact that most problems require you to do triple integrals rather than single.

Well you type like a moron, so I assumed you were either A) drunk or B) underage.  You didn't type a short version of a question. You literally just took out letters in a sentence and made yourself look dumb. Instead of deleting it and actually typing your question out like a functioning adult, you got mad that no one is answering your question, which is why people are roasting you.  No one here is going to answer you "if u typ like this bruh." 
I didn't consider this until you mentioned it. Now I'm jealous I didn't think of it.

* destruction of public property * clear violent ideation * seemingly little regard for other lives  Yeah, I'd definitely praise that.  Expressing yourself is awesome, and it's good that a kid that age feels ok doing that. But that is in no way the correct response to that situation.
Let me preface this by saying that I've been a memer since they first appeared on 4chan circa 2006 (ages ago in internet time). I remember refreshing /b/ all afternoon with the hope that someone would make a new meme. I was a memer back when Advice Dog was the only one and I still upvote every Advice Dog meme I see becasue of the fond rush of nostalgia it brings me. Nowadays, there are many thousand on quickmeme and other meme websites. I was a memer back before memegenerator was created (the first meme website) and I had to make them with MS Powerpoint or Paint. Speaking of meme websites, I was one of the first submitters to memebase.com and still have one of the top accounts there despite having migrated to reddit nearly 2 years ago. It was on 4chan and memebase where I cut my teeth creating memes, way before I had a reddit account and way before /r/adviceanimals[1] was created in late 2010. Back before I could get any sort of points or even username recognition, I was creating memes as a clever and easily digestible way to reflect on society, relate some story to my audience, or just be funny. Do you remember rich raven? No? I do. You probably don't remember depression dog, crazy girlfriend praying mantis, introspective pug, or friendzone Johnny either. I remember all of them. In fact, you have only submitted two posts to adviceanimals garnering a total of just 4 points and have not commented there any time recently. So please, respect my judgement regarding the direction of the subreddit and the integrity of posts I have held dear to my heart for nearly 7 years but you have no strong feelings for. Thanks.

No grounds to argue tax cuts are *always* beneficial. But we can argue if they are helpful in a particular instance till the cows come home. No financial policy is the right choice for every situation, that much is obvious.   But, because there are so many variables, we can argue about which policy is the right one in a given situation. Its unlikely anyone would have the perfect choice so we are left to argue what we think will work with imperfect data.

Ce qui m'a le plus aidé était l'organisation de ma journée le matin. Je pense que c'est une mauvaise idée d'avoir un google agenda avec des plages horaires prédéfinies qui ne sont pas flexibles et d'on peut facilement les ignorer. Comme c'est ce qui m'a le plus aidé je vais m'étaler sur le sujet. Déjà ça permet de commencer la journée et d'avoir une idée de comment elle va se dérouler.   Personnellement j'organise ma liste de cette manière : Je fais une liste des trucs que j'ai à faire, exemple :  - Faire la vaisselle: Choisir un sujet pour un devoir, Ranger mon studio, Inviter cette fille à boire un verre, appeller mes parents, faire les cartes de révision pour la semaine pro, envoyer un mail à mon prof sur une question spécifique.  Comme tu peux le voir c'est pas seulement des activités en rapport avec mes études mais ma vie personnelle en général (On peut aussi procrastiner sur d'autres tâches de la vie quotidienne, personnellement ça m'a permit d'organiser plus de choses) Ensuite j'organise ma journée  8h-10h : Cours de langues  1015h-11h: Choisir mon sujet de mon devoirs  11h05-12h : faire mes cartes de révisions 12h15-13h: Déjeuner 13h15-15h: Cours de Sciences Politiques 15h15-16h: Envoyer le mail au prof + Inviter la fille à boire un vers et appeller mes parents 16h15-17h00: Révision du Partiel (Séances 1 à 6 (avec les cartes que j'ai fait le matin))  17h15- 17h45: je rentre chez moi 18h-18h30: ranger mon studio et faire la vaisselle Soirée :Netflix/jeu vidéo puis je sors avec les potes   Je porte ce petit bout de papier chaque jour dans ma poche et si un truc arrive dans la journée (exemple un pote qui veux réviser avec toi et te le dis en cours de langue le matin) Bah je peux facilement changer mon planning en faisant d'abord les cartes de révisions, le voir à 11h et choisir mon sujet entre 16h15 et 17h. Personnellement ça me permet de commencé tout de suite la tâche prévues quand je m'installe dans mon coin préféré de la bibli car c'est ce que je dois faire à ce moment là. J'ai mes pauses entre chaque tâches (le temps de se déplacer à la bibli, et souffler un coup etc...).

First, follow the manual for your car. Some say 50,000 and some say 100,000. Those are when you should change it.   Replacing both fluids is a good thing. Over time they break down and/or pick up contaminants that can affect their chemistry causing problems. A good example was GM Dexcool and the plastic gasket they used. Under normal conditions over time the chemistry of the Dexcool changed slightly which causes it to attack the plastic on the gasket which made it brittle a prone to cracking.   For radiator fluid it's cycled inside something with moving parts that wear and introduced metal dust into the fluid. Over time it also breaks down and looses it's lubricating and protecting properties and should be replaced eventually.

There's nothing that prevents health insurance companies from selling across state lines, you realize. That was just something Trump pretended was a revolutionary idea. The only reason insurance companies don't do that now is because you have to be licensed in the other state and follow whatever their state laws are, and it's not profitable to sell in that manner. It's only profitable if you can sell a subpar plan in a state where it would normally not be allowed.

Definitely Daniel Agger. What I'd do for a fit Agger in his prime in our team now... 
I mean, its not like whales don't want more f2p friendly stuff either. Just because we spend money doesn't mean we wouldn't want more hand outs lol
Jaune can face forward if you just put his foot on the other peg
I'm not against trying to fix it in a vacuum. I'm against trying to fix it when there are other problems that I think are more important, like the state of the PK.
Mine have been through the dishwasher plenty of times and they’re fine.   It’s boiled milk and the fancy cocoa.

&gt; Are you not doing the same thing? This post says nothing about Moore. By this post, you cannot tell if the poster endorses him or not.  If this post wasn't a parallel to the top two current posts on this subreddit, I will eat my own shoes.  &gt; Why is "Let's not support them." not enough?   It's to demonstrate how transparent this post is in its intentions. &gt; ? You are "whatabouting" about Moore here, literally using the word "about."  You can whatabout a whatabout? Isn't that just bringing it back to the original topic that this thread is calling out?  &gt; I usually agree with you, and I do agree with being actively against Moore, but this comment seems a little hypocritical.  Please tell me how I'm wrong. This is exactly how this thread has played out and how other people are treating it. I'm sure that you've seen reaction threads when subreddits like this has drama, this is absolutely, positively par for the course. They're not being clever when they post them.
Wes Welker you know the Julian Edelman before Julian Edelman 
This is pretty neat, I like the idea of the shoes but the orange just feels very harsh.
If you're really looking to change his mind, ask him: "What would change your mind on this issue?"  Give him similar things that would change your mind on the issue.  Try to come to the discussion with respect for their views, nobody's mind is ever changed by someone who "just knows the truth, okay?"  Look to seek the truth alongside them, and you're much more likely to get results.

Cool.  When are you getting the rest of it?
With that attitude, they will.
I personally am happy to see Djoo's back in the lineup.  
&gt; No bank will approve a loan to anyone unemployed. Plus they usually want a steady work history.  Point of clarity for folks with substantial long term capital gains income, landlords, retired folks, those on permanent disability, those getting significant child support, etc:  Those things count too. Retired people that planned well get mortgages all the time. 
First, what are the questions?  Second, maybe try r/languagelearning or r/italianlearning ?  Third, for communication with real people, try r/languageexchange or a sub like that?
Who let SCP-049 out?
For someone I'm pinning down as a Trump hater, you use sentence structure that looks a lot like his.   So are you the kind of person who only believes in fake upvotes/comments when your party is the victim of it? Additionally, don't you think that's kind of irrelevant given I am discussing mod **removal** of articles by sources at their discretion?   I don't know why you're attempting to get me to stop commenting. The very structure of this wonderful forum makes it so you never have to be bothered by comments you don't enjoy. However it's nice to see a simple minded leftist reveal their true animosity in a civil and reasonable exchange of comments like this one. 
Dunno, I like it too.  I skim and skip anything that I just dont want to read, or arguments for the sake of arguments.  I dont have time for that.  But theres great stuff too, and folks that want to have honest discussions. We're also all programmers, so you know. Im frankly suprised humans can communicate at all.  Whats a joke to one person is srs bsnss to another.  One person is pedantic to a fault, while another is loose with terms etc.   At work we've found a decent portion of the time we're saying the same thing with radically different words and framing.  Just clarifying how your using terms can often defuse arguments. Then theres just bad actors. Today is overthink day for me.  :)
It's not 'standard' in the industry.  Campus recruiting is 'standard' in the industry. Being contacted by head hunters or recruiters is 'standard' in the industry. Being referred to a firm by a friend or sellside is 'standard'. Even cold emailing PMs or VPs is pretty 'standard'.  Recruiting on Reddit with a gmail account is hardly 'standard'.
That thing is like a mother fuckin carpet bomb

I don't think it says anything innate about them as a person, but it does likely provide some information on how they were perceived and treated by others during their formative years.
Thanks for the reply! The only reason it would be three months is so I can go in the 90 day visa waver programme, if I could get a visa to stay longer I would but I don’t think I would be accepted being an unemployed single graduate with no property! My thinking is that if I did three months doing the AT I would be more likely to be accepted for a six month+ visa in 2019 to do a PCT thru hike. I have considered just applying for the visa but it’s £160 even if you’re rejected and while I have that money I really don’t wanna just flush it on a risk like that. 
That'd be a vasectomy. Pretty sure castration is a one way street.
Yes, we basically named our planet dirt.
Some goat shit will stop those eyes from misting like that
You should of added '#self ad' to the end of you're title. Why post this as a TIL, just post it under any other sub and say "Hey check out our travel YouTube channel, we traveled by boat over 10,500miles to Mexico, French Polynesia, Hawaii and back to San Diego. Then we bought an RV and traveled 20,000miles across USA, Canada and Alaska, all in the name of adventure."

yeah he’s the best seller by far, such a nice guy. great to hear thanks man!
I don't think she's nearly as popular anymore. BUT she also hasn't done anything in months, Taylor is a hot topic right now with reputation just being released. Subs tend to get much for active during releases and tour announcements

Depeche mode fuck yeah
Y'all needed to make some trades before the deadline.
They'd have to stack the cast and make it hard to form large alliances. The eliminations could be similar to free agents with the kill cards.   The cast on Rivals 3 was mostly hot trash. 
The gear is pretty nice. 
&gt; Downvote all you want I could care less but white people will never be the culture no matter how much y'all try   I was agreeing with you up until this. We just gonna act like Paul Wall hasn't directly influenced what we see and hear today ?  There's clearly a difference between the white listener that grew up on hip hop and can relate to and understand the music, compared to the teenage/young adult that fetishises hip hop culture and has only ever been looking from the outside in. Post Malone and the majority of this sub fall into the latter category.
you should be able to get around that too given some effort and time. Good on you for keeping at it though
lol - I remember when gas was $0.59 a gallon.
In my world I’m trying to avoid direct parallels with real life but at the same time also avoid portraying weapons and armor in a way that would be too unrealistic.
Tbf, FSU currently might be a better job than NU. And they know what they're doing: more upset Husker fans + more jubilated FSU fans = more clicks

Awesome stuff!
Start by going “ta” with just your mouth. Then go to the mouthpiece, and just the mouthpiece. Still go “ta” a lot. Then start “ta-ing” while buzzing in the mouthpiece. Then try the actual trombone, and just do “tas” and just play an F. Basic ass F. Then try a Bb and do the same thing. Then a high Bb, as Zenyatta says, repitition is the path to mastery. Then after try the Bb scale in quarter notes at like 90 bpm. Then eighth notes. If it is all done in one day, you will have a stronger impulse to use a “ta”. For extra assurance, warm up with the Bb scale in eighth notes, but focus on articulation. I hope this helped! :)
I think you only get the ammo if you pick the weapon off the ground.  If you take it from their inventory you just get the gun.
Some subs ban you (happen to me) for linking Instagram.
This is on a local classified add. looks of good work done but why? and the color!? I don't get it
Sorry I misread your comment. Yeah it's on Xbox and I believe PlayStation (not 100% on PlayStation)
OP said no clocks.
Man that’s so cute
This idea's been brought up, and said no to a billion times, because a large chunk of people LIKE that they can play who they enjoy Aesthetically  Doing this is asking for everyone to play Meg or Claudette, it doesn't work.
&gt; Suppose you're right, I try to keep all possibilities open for interpretation. I however am lead to believe he wasn't a "ghost" but rather someone from either a different time period or another dimension/ reality.  What makes you say that, in particular? Was his clothing "out of place" in some way?  Another possibility - he could have been someone  astral projecting, perhaps...?

I live in Kansas City, one of the few cities in this country with actual cable competition, and specifically I live in q Google Fiber neighborhood. I have Comcast and I've never been throttled and gotten an insane deal on my internet. It just goes to show how much they can do if they care. 
Huh. MacMillian said as i asked in discord: "Ping the mods, the members can intervene if they wish". So i did. So should i rather ping every single member?
OMG other people have this thing! I've always described it as my brain being petted.
It's been great.  The shell retainer for the magazine tube was a little sticky at first, but it worked out. And you can see obvious braizing in places, which I'm not sure is entirely awesome. But it's been 100% so far, and for the price it's been fantastic

But how would they do a new game? The X plot line is fucked beyond repair, the Zero series came to a proper close, and ZX lead nicely into Megaman Legends. Unless they completely scrap X6 to X8 how could they fit another game into the timeline?

(I'm a bot) ***** &gt; President Donald Trump is weighing a national security shakeup that could involve replacing CIA Director Mike Pompeo with Arkansas Sen.Tom Cotton.  &gt; Several CIA veterans reacted with alarm on Thursday to news that Republican Sen. Tom Cotton could replace Mike Pompeo as head of the intelligence agency within the next two months.  &gt; Former CIA analyst Ned Price, who served as a National Security Council spokesman under Obama, shared concerns over the future of the US&amp;#039;s relationship with Iran if placed in the hands of Pompeo at the State Department and Cotton at the CIA. &amp;quot;I certainly think Cotton will continue much of what Pompeo started,&amp;quot; Price said, referring to a common perception of Pompeo&amp;#039;s CIA leadership as partisan and motivated, at least in part, by loyalty to Trump.   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7gqvc7/intelligence_veterans_blast_tom_cotton_as/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 1.65, ~257112 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **Cotton**^#1 **CIA**^#2 **Iran**^#3 **intelligence**^#4 **Pompeo**^#5

I mean, I tend to get frustrated with myself for playing so poorly and doing a really bad job. And I understand in general frustration at losing, but I absolutely find it silly to blame survivors for it. They're playing the game how its meant to be played and doing a good job. I'll still play normally, won't camp or anything like that.   (assuming they aren't using an SWF Discord group. In which case fuck that bullshit) 
Point is when we're talking khabib is not about his record, is about showing up. If he shows against Edson (and with his history that's a big if) he'll still have only four fights in four years. He'll still be one fight removed from not pulling out. He shouldn't be rewarded for not showing up and not making weight.   Imagine if Khabib becomes interim champ. There's a higher chance of every /r/mma user winning the lotto jackpot than Khabib being healthy and in weight to fight a defending champ McGregor.
Dick Vitale is so old he's about to become an Adult Diaper Dandy

&gt; The writing I wouldn't spend too much time fixing unless I was asked by the student to help them become more concise.  I'm somewhat the opposite.  I generally teach 'close-to-graduation' students in computer science.  I go a long way out of my way to give feedback on poor writing - structure, logic, etc.  It almost physically hurts when I see people who can't communicate about things they probably understand.  I often make the point that shortly they will be expected to be able to explain to their boss, to a grant reviewer, or a coworker what it is they have done, or want to do.  They must be able to explain complicated ideas to a technically competent person who has little or no training in their speciality.  If they never learn how to do this, they will be significantly limiting themselves in the future.  Perhaps I have this perspective as a adjunct who has spent a career managing both up and down the chain...  Often when interviewing, I'll ask written questions (via email) of candidates asking them to explain or justify something they have on their resume or something they discussed in a phone interview.  People who can't communicate well over email about technical subjects are not people I want to hire.
&gt; sexist  thats right ladies.  This blue little faggot thinks women in revealing clothing is sexist, you know, that thing you find empowering.  Its super sexist because this retard wants to get laid.
Oh, it could have been executed 1000x better, no argument there. I liked it in part because I wasn't taking the game all that seriously, and it's just an enjoyably weird idea. But SO3 really does have some huge dissonance in tone - gameplay and art wise, it's light and fluffy, but much of the story is...*bleak*--and then you have that twist thrown in which just...*negates* the seriousness after the game's spent so long hammering it in. It's really weird for sure.

How do you know that? I’m a finance major, I work as an accountant, prices typically rise with inflation. Game prices haven’t changed since the PS2 days, and the cost to make games is much higher. 
1 bitcoin and Ill do it.
Truck driver.  I actually made an attempt to go to college many years ago but realized that I make more than my friends/family/relatives with college degrees and some went unemployed for a period of time while sitting on their diplomas.  I have been able to move anywhere in the U.S. and always have more than enough work making about 75k/yr with the potential to make 100k with full benefits, retirement plan and awesome insurance.  I don't deal with customers (broker and salesmen do that) and I rarely deal with people except for friendly mechanics.  Great job if you have no patience for dealing with people.  I drive nights to avoid traffic.

When I installed my furnace, I had a strong chemical odor for about 3 or 4 days.  Some of it was from the furnace itself, and some was from the mastic (used to seal the ductwork) and other materials I used in the installation, such as pipe sealant, PVC epoxy, etc.  It went away after running for less than a week.  For reference, this was a 70K BTU Rheem, natural gas.

LOL.  A new fake news narrative begins. I guess Morning Joe is afraid about people investigating the intern he allegedly killed in Florida.   http://gawker.com/remember-when-a-dead-intern-was-found-in-joe-scarboroug-1711985081 I love seeing these self righteous media personalities fall. Lauer, Rose, Ailes, O'Reilly, I reckon Morning Joe knows he's next.
Oh, thanks! I did some research about it and I understood your point now! Thanks!
Thanks for the reply! I sort of starting using them all at once, which I know is not what you're supposed to do. I like your suggestion of taking out the sleeping pack and the AM moisturizer, and seeing what happens. I'll give that a try. Thanks again for the advice. :-)
Good to hear that.  Because I'll never stop using semi autos.  I've pretty much stuck to using the FAL in every game for years now.

Yes, the code does work. It will loop through for hours then suddenly the RPi will freeze. Other times it never gets past the part where it checks if it can ping google.com without the RPi freezing.   I am going to go back and clean up and comment the code. 
You really don't want that cpu. It's [considerably weaker than even a Ryzen 3](http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/AMD-Ryzen-3-1200-vs-AMD-A10-7890K-APU/3931vsm118648), which is a lot cheaper. It's an old platform that uses DDR3 and there's really nothing to upgrade to from it. I'd try to stretch your budget a little bit and get a Ryzen 5. Even if you don't want to spend the extra $50, like I said a $100 Ryzen 3 will perform better than that A10.

If, as your last paragraph suggests, by "confrontation" you mean "a direct military confrontation" as opposed to just "any kind of confrontation" (e.g., cyberwar, indirect proxy war, covert measure to meddle in internal politics, etc.), then the same things that could lead to "a direct military confrontation" are the things that would lead to any other kind of confrontation, for so long as Vladimir Putin remains in power.  The beginning and end of why Vladimir Putin acts the way he does is to preserve, protect, and expand the national and international powerbase he holds. That's why he's done the things he's been doing to the Russian oil industry, as well as to that class of Russian oligarchs that once labored under the delusion that they were untouchable. Examples of this abound in recent memory: invasion of Georgia, invasion of East Ukraine, invasion and conquest of Crimea, etc.  The conditions under which Putin would provoke a military conflict are these: where the probability of success is sufficiently great, and the cost of that success is not unreasonably high. So, Putin will only engage in a military attack where it's rational for him to do so. However, the costs of any success (however probable) have to be weighed against the costs of less intrusive means (namely, cyberwarfare -- especially espionage-- and information warfare).   Though a controversial statement in some circles (for mostly political reasons, than rational ones), the United States and West more generally are currently engaged in a conflict with Russia. However, the battlefront for that conflict is in the minds of people, and the weapons of choice are ideas disseminated both directly and indirectly among the greater populations of United States and other European countries by Russian intelligence. This is mostly done through social media, the internet, and the like. By all counts, the Kremlin's efforts have been tremendously successful. After all, Trump got elected. Brexit happened. Putin's first loss was in France, when Le Pen failed to secure a victory. As long as those measures are effective at facilitating Putin's interests, no military escalation will occur.  However, a change of power in Washington might signal the end of those methods' efficacy. For example, if a political party were elected in Washington that took Russia's political meddling in the United States' democracy seriously, then measures could be taken to retaliate either directly and proportionally (by doing the same thing inside Russia and in the sphere of Russia's geopolitical influence, especially Ukraine), or indirectly (by harming Russia's interests elsewhere, like sending NATO troops to train Ukrainian soldiers, and stacking troops on the borders of NATO countries).   While it is hard to predict "how" Putin would initiate a military conflict, evidence (from Georgia and Ukraine) suggests it would be a Speznaz invasion under the dark of night by ununiformed soldiers of the Russian army, into a region where American troops were located. Putin would deny on the world stage that the troops were his, and would rather claim that they were "eastern Ukrainian rebels". The US State department, desiring to avoid war with Russia, might allow this to slip (if controlled by Republicans) though if the State department was feeling like it had a spine, they would retaliate in kind and pretend that they weren't fighting Russian soldiers and only killing Ukrainian rebels. Whether Putin engaged in further military action in the first place would depend on what he thought the American and NATO response would be.   Another example, further on the spectrum of events which have a probability of leading to military conflict between the US and Russia, would exist in the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO. Regardless of the probable American response, Putin would attack Ukraine in that case because it would in his mind be worth the risk of war with NATO's collective defense. After all, Ukraine joining NATO is probably the end of Putin's power (due to the impact it would have on the Russian oil industry).   A war between the US and Iran, or any military action the US could possibly take anywhere other than in Ukraine would not lead to a military conflict between the US and Russia, now that Syria is off the table. Syria well may have led to such a military conflict, but the prospect of that happening is very low now. Mike Pompeo and Tom Cotton do not have the power to start wars, either. Pompeo is too savvy for that, and Cotton is too dimwitted to stumble into that kind of power.

It's because he knows he can do something on his own terms that makes him just enough. I think the show gives him crap for his apartment/condo because he's not a flashy guy who gets caught up in the mix. He could do a Rick Reilly backpage column monthly and make more than enough to be happy; he knows he came onto fame/success early and quick enough that it's stacked as opposed to playing from behind financially or professionally.   Wouldn't be stunned if his parents forced him to invest/save from an early point because of their background so he knows he's covered. I mean, hell, Cote has bank

Um, no. Sower is really strong because he represents an almost impossible to avoid threat to your life total. In all but some rare situations he's going to get 5 damage through, and he does this while ALSO being a big blocker. I'd play him in midrange in almost any color combo if I could.

The founding fathers weren't just a small group of individuals.  They were delegates sent by the governments of the states.  Thomas Jefferson was acting on behalf of the government of Virginia, Franklin was acting on behalf of Pennsylvania, etc. It wasn't just a case of a few influential individuals who declared independence, it was the already established and legitimate government of 13 colonies that declared independence.  
I don’t know! That’s why I’m asking how others have dealt with similar feelings - to see how I can learn from them.  I think it partially comes from insecurity, and partially because I feel like I need external validation.   I wouldn’t wish this feeling on someone else.
The shortages are mostly localized, and exist because trans women are basically the only ones using injectable estradiol, so there’s not an enormous supply to begin with. Cis women usually go for pills, patches or implants (they’re usually on much lower doses).

This past Sunday I tripped on 625ug with a godly amount of weed, definitely really feel you with how weed is different. Whenever I smoke a lot of weed now it feels like this strange weed/acid hybrid drug that even contains some slight visuals and definite full blown tracers. Shit's crazy.
Now I'll never comment to one of your posts :(
Damn...let me just give you a sincere 'thank you' for taking the time to explain this clearly to me.  I really appreciate it, and am glad to see there are genuinely nice people on the internet still.  My understanding of the camera system in GMS2 is that you have a camera just floating out in space with it's own coordinates, and it creates a view with separate coordinates.  So I'm pretty sure the view and camera have different coordinates.  I didn't have time to test out your z axis direction idea from yesterday but this weekend I'll test it out and also try out these formulas you've provided.   Where did you learn about these formulas by the way? (top_left_x = cam_x + w/2 *  up_y + h/2 * up_x;)

I've spent days trying. I have a theory that some DS3 players are just completely hated by the RNG. There's some weird correlation with players who *never* find the Symbol of Avarice no matter what they do *also* complaining that the grind will get them maybe one covenant item per day, and I'm very much in that category. I spent all of my time finishing up Darkmoon also grinding those silver knights for those ears, and I got a grand total of 1. I spent all the time I've spent so far as an Aldrich Faithful (while waiting for the next summon), which is 3 days, grinding those Deacons for dregs, and so far they dropped 1.

Use those feathers on 500 sp specials and for real you should have no issues with score ~~outside of player skill~~. I'm like 99% your problem is not optimizing skills for SP value.

Darkest Dungeon. The gameplay, the town management, the *phenomenal* narration and the gothic aesthetic all come together to make a game best described as the Lovecraftian flavored unholy spawn of XCOM and Diablo 2.

Also open containers of alcohol should not be illegal, again, like most of the world. Getting rid of those two laws alone would eliminate most of the 'legal' problems at Ezra.

I'm definitely against armed insurrection or political violence, but I'm okay with threats.  Since our government is operating with no fear of legal repercussions, it's really all we have.  More than the internet's at stake.  This sets the precedent that our government isn't beholden to us at all, that they can openly choose to take what is ours and give it to the wealthy.  This is unacceptable and has already gotten way out of hand, but a political bloodbath might fix America, violence will do much more harm than good.  But if he succeeds, and something horrible happens to him, you'll see me celebrating it right here on Reddit.  Assuming Verizon's internet allows me to do so.
I'm sorry to be snooty but the popularity of shows like family guy and American dad make me weep for our culture.  Seth McFarlands whole sense of humor boils down to two things. Make a reference that some people understand, be very mean. With 80 years of television I think it's pretty demising of many greats to assume family guy would make it at all let alone 3-5 times.  Think how many shows have existed just since the year 2000.  I just reread your post, you said top 100 YOUVE watched, where as I thought "existed".   This is why I was fired up.

Keep in mind all of this is with high 90+ stats in the relevant skill and at lower levels void lags behind in effectiveness.

When it comes to Islam as a whole it's not even advocated.   &gt;Why focus on that when you have those awesome tenants.   You're focusing on that. You're literally focusing on the bullshit.   With your logic all Christians want to behead nom Christians right? I mean there is a Christian terrorist group in Africa hat advocates that so that means all Christians advocate it correct?  &gt;It's sad that it's so hard for you to admit that being a part of a group that encourages you to kill people is a bad thing.   I never once denied that. I'm just pointing out that you're a bigot because you believe that's what all Muslims believe or that it's even advocated in their religious texts

Just for the record I'm not trying to take away from his accomplishment, getting as good as Embiid is by 23 is amazing no matter what age you start playing at.

Statistically, at close range the BAR has a slightly better TTK.  By the way, my favourite gun in this game is the M1941. Then the Type 100, third place FG42. MG42 is pretty high too.

As I recall this happened to the Pats in 2002.  I might be wrong, but as I remember it Pats would have beaten the Jets in a head to head tiebreaker, but if you added Miami to the mix the Pats chances of winning drastic go down.
"Baltimore Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in South Baltimore. On Wednesday night, two officers noticed a man acting suspiciously and showing characteristics of a person armed with a gun. The officers approached Allen Hosea Johnson Jr. and attempted to get the gun, but the Johnson fought back. During a struggle between the officers and Johnson, one round was fired from the gun and shot an officer in the palm of his hand. According to Commissioner Kevin Davis, the second officer used his stun gun, was able to handcuff Johnson, and retrieve the gun. The officer, a three year veteran of the police force, was taken to Shock Trauma for a non-life-threatening injury. Davis says the officer is in good spirits and will be fine. Johnson is in custody and was taken to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center. Johnson has been charged with Attempted First and Second Degree Murder, Illegal Possession of a Firearm, Felony Assault Second Degree of a Law Enforcement Officer, as well as other firearm and drug-related charges."

I didn’t realize cats sucking on soft things was a ‘thing’! At least once a week my little girl jumps on my lap and becomes a pur factory and suckles on a blanket (or her absolute favorite, my soft bathrobe) until she fall asleep. It’s the most precious thing and it makes me feel like we’re so close she can let her guard down around me. Man, cats are so great. I’m gonna go give her a treat :)

Can you link me anything that points to this actually being policy? I've tried looking it up and most of the links on google turn to this one recent incident where they did shoot a guy in the thigh (Although I didn't see anything that said whether they were instructed to or not, most leg shots that are reported are typically the officer missing the torso)  I don't know man apparently I can give you example after example and quotes from medical experts on just how deadly leg shots are and you just kinda  want to resort to a feels argument  &gt;  I think you will have hard time to prove that the american system works better.  How many people in Finland point their weapons at cops on a regular basis? It's almost like it's an entirely different society with different social atmospheres that aren't very similar at all and doesn't help your point in the slightest.
I would say watch them both.  Brotherhoods main problem to me is to much is compressed in the first episodes.  Basically having 30 episodes worth of show in 10 because it was shown in the first one already.

Well, if we're flashing badges, I have a degree in English Lit (thus the time to watch TV) - so I doubt I am either.   When a piece of fiction is going out of its way to distance itself or react against similar pieces then you need to give it the benefit of the doubt, so to speak. Consider the possibility, for instance, that the reason Tench reacts in a normal, almost healthy way, is specifically because he looks like the meathead cop in every other detective program.  
Maybe not as eloquent as 64 or Sunshine... But Super Mario World did it *so* right for its time. Seeing the path move as you completed levels, the music, charming design... I might just have my nostalgia glasses on, but when I think of an "overworld" I jump right to Super Mario World.
My grandma cares a lot that is true. It would be better. I know its dumb, like I'm not denying that here. My dad once said, go live at grandmas house, be just like your brother. Its so stupid I know but its just so in my head. If I go there I'm just following the same exact path he is. I'll be no different than him. I don't want to be like that, if I had to choose between that and death, I'd choose the latter.

Defining 'left' is implicitly a difficult task. If anything I judge left/right as a metric of concern for workers vs concern for capital.  I feel that if a politician defends Israel against valid criticism they are doing it to gain corporate support since Israel is a key global-corporate ally (military industrial complex etc).  To me, that means they put capital above workers/people to an extent that I cannot label them as 'Left'.  That's just how I read the situation and it's a subjective judgement.  I don't really know why Thornberry is opposed to boycotts. I just think my reasoning above is the most likely explanation since I see the BDS movement as about the only thing that will force Israel to end their decades-old apartheid system and a valid 'criticism' of Israeli policies.

People who say "look i'm a success and I dropped out of college. It worked for me!" as some sort of life advice is like a lottery winner saying "I cashed in all of my savings to buy lottery tickets. It worked for me!" I mean, sure it worked for one person at least. Doesn't mean it isn't a fucking stupid thing to.  And pointing out person X or Y that failed school and was a CEO is ignoring all of the other thousands who were in a similar position WITH a degree. 
I just find it utterly bizarre that the same people who won't vote Corbyn because he'll "turn us into Venezuela" voted for Brexit because "some things are more important than the economy".  You'd fuck our economy for sovereignty, but the immense suffering of the poor and sick, and the irreversible systematic dismantlement of our public services just isn't worth the cost.
Wow, those are perfect! You should be proud.

So much about dating as described on PPD only applies to the US.  All this fuss made over how the man always has to pay for a date... never had a problem splitting the bill in the UK.  Formal dating in general for that matter is not really a thing anymore, either you go friends &gt; FWB &gt; relationship or you go out casually to see a movie or something then bang and see if you like each other.   A lot of tradcons claim women these days don't want families, I dunno where they live but I've yet to meet any.  Religion is quickly dying in the UK so any religious aspect of the whole thing from the US certainly won't apply here.  The class issues discussed here certainly differ because to be truly upper class in the UK you need to be a fucking lord or a duke or something. Unless you come from the Royal Family you max out at UMC. And British MC-UMC culture is different to the US, because they essentially just act like they think aristocrats act, and they also tend to be champaign socialists because that's trendy. Both of those behaviours are due to envy of the UC they'll never truly be a part of. It's a weird thing to witness.   Anyway probably loads more I can't remember off the top of my head but yeah this stuff varies a lot by local culture.

Hello again, and thanks for your response. In all honesty, I've made no effort. Nothing brings me more pleasure than video games. Being stoned only enhances the joy. I'm also concerned that I may have screen addiction since I've basically been in front of a computer and online for the past 25 years. I used the term rut, but I should have said routine. As I said, I have no other stresses, and  never get depressed, and don't worry about finances, nor do I work.

Actually, a full rewire and lock removal itself encreases performance. And using a NiMh pack, even at the same voltage, allows more *current* to flow than stock AAs can provide. You'll actually get a pretty noticeable boost by doing so.

I’m pretty sure all of our POC are on scholarship now and many of our sophomores. The hardest part of the entire process is getting cadets to complete their requirements.

This is amazing haha
&gt;Yes, he was a movie actor and a lot of the martial arts shown are staged with pulled punches. Despite that, we know he has won real fights and also taught martial arts. This at the very least suggests he's more than just a movie actor. Enough notable people have trained with him and vouched that he was the real deal that reducing him to just a movie actor is preposterous.  LOL. The fact you're trying to argue that the myths and legends of his "supposed fights" are enough to prove him as a great fighter is a joke when you try to dismiss the video showing Bruce Lee's poor technique and punching fundamentals.  &gt;We don't know what that video shows, because we don't know what he was trying to train. No context is given.  We do know what it is, we see Bruce Lee working that bag and having poor punching form and technique.  &gt;And this is why you are framing everything as a boxing problem in a boxing context. This is what you know. Boxing has rules and within those boxing rules, everything you said probably holds true. You can win a fight without ever punching someone in the face. In fact, I have seen multiple in-person fights where people were truly going for the kill and they started and ended with kicks.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dI998TEspM  What is this supposed to show? Bruce Lee fighting someone his size? Do I need to repeat how Mike Tyson in his prime was probably 80-100 lbs heavier than Bruce Lee, taller, longer limbs, and definitely more well versed and fighting than he ever was?  The fact you posted this video is absolutely ridiculous. I can tell you have never fought a real fight, nor have you probably seen what a heavyweight prime Mike Tyson does. It's like, you seriously think that Bruce Lee would be able to stand right there and counter punch/kick a better counter puncher who could eat his shots and slip them simple enough? Lee couldn't stop these guys from fighting back, and you really think he could do better against a bigger, faster, stronger, and better fighter?   &gt;In the end, we are talking about something completely hypothetical. My claim is that weight class is not the final deciding factor in a fight to the death, that Bruce Lee is trained in a wider variety of martial arts and that he would have an advantage against Mike Tyson in that situation.   Your claim is wrong, and a joke. I'm telling you from someone who has ring experience and recognizes what power is vs. bigger and smaller fighters. You go to any professional fighter/trainer well versed with fighting at any MMA or Boxing gym, and they will straight up laugh in your face when you claim Bruce Lee has an advantage against Mike Tyson in any fight scenario involving them face to face without anything but their fists.   You're probably one of those people who seriously thinks Bruce Lee would land the first punch/kick several times, all quicker than Tyson's first (LOL). At the end of the day, you have no video evidence, nothing to show me Lee can stand up to this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBDsfGTQpdc   Oh, and these are all men 6'0" / 210 lbs+ in fighting shape.  Last but not least, on one of his, "legendary fights":  &gt;&gt;Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell, James Lee (Bruce Lee's associate, no relation), and William Chen, a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan. Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20–25 minutes.[42] Wong claims that he had originally expected a serious but polite bout; however Lee had attacked him very aggressively with intent to kill, straight from the beginning of the bout when he had replied to Wong's traditional handshake offer by "pretending to extend a friendly hand only to suddenly transform the hand into a four-pronged spear aimed at Wong's eyes". Forced to defend his life, he had nonetheless refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could earn him a prison sentence. The fight ended due to Lee's "unusually winded" condition, as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter.[42] According to Bruce Lee, Linda Lee Cadwell, and James Yimm Lee however, the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee. In Cadwell's account, "The fight ensued, it was a no-holds-barred fight, it took three minutes. Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said 'do you give up?' and the man said he gave up".[41] A couple of weeks after the bout, Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger, which Wong says was an obvious reference to him.[42] In response, Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese Pacific Weekly, a Chinese-language newspaper in San Francisco, with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account. Lee did not respond to the invitation "despite his reputation for responding with fists of fury to the slightest provocation" And you know what? If you still want to argue, go post on r/mma and ask them what they think. They should be unbiased/favor Bruce Lee, right? Let me know how many people you can find actually agree with you when you get laughed at. Maybe they'll be able to educate you better on this manner, since I'm kind of being an ass about this (and I do apologize on that regard). I'm sorry to crush your childhood dreams, but Bruce lee was a movie actor first and foremost. Not a fighter. He could have been a great fighter, in a lower weight class in MMA or Boxing, but he was never beating Mike Tyson at his best.
But his support of neo nazi's is fine. 
Read a book called The Millionaire Mind that surveyed millionaires, asking questions like this, among others. Rich doctors and lawyers emphasized grades/GPA more than other fields, unsurprisingly. Most millionaires did not inherit their wealth, most were college graduates, and their GPA on average was 2.9  &gt;Some of the myths about these people are that they were all straight A students, scored at the top on the SAT, attended elite private schools, etc.  The average SAT score for the sample was 1190.  Their most frequent grade in both high school and college was “B.”  Their GPA in college was 2.9.  They typically did not qualify for admission to an “elite” college or university.  But there were a few who, in spite of their mediocre credentials, somehow made it into the freshman class of a prestigious college.  http://www.thomasjstanley.com/2012/12/college-ranking-not-among-millionaires-key-success-factors/  What I noticed though is that they often severely downplay the role of luck, and like to attribute their success more often to other factors like being well disciplined or having a strong marriage. In a separate book by Nicholas Nassim Taleb titled The Black Swan, he notes that for every successful millionaire, there's plenty just as disciplined or whatever else who fail simply because of bad luck.
Dude, it's a what if scenario.

ANYONE SEEN SPACE WHALE'S KEYS?!?! 
I tie it in the most basic way of tying a shoe. It's the shallow heel area that's my problem, not tightness. Feels like my heel is going to pop out, regardless of how tight the laces are.  Too late anyways - returned em already. Thanks though!
Can we still sell the United Club one-time pass from MPE? Each pass has an associated barcode but there's no MP Number or Name on it.
With the way we're playing now, the thought of adding Ellis into the mix is making my pants feel a little tighter.

Here's hoping to finally get an ice subclass!
Fuck... I'm going on a diet
I agree 100%. It only got worse as more updates were added and prices went up. The longer people wait to jump in, the harder it is to even get started. From the beginning it was fine and bearable for awhile before it got ridiculous. They've only now discovered the power of microtransactions and I think we're all smart enough to realize that they're not going away now that Rockstar is down with them now too.
You might want to try a few/all of those restrictions:  * No shield * No ranged weapons * No offensive spells * No healing consumable (Estus only)

Is there a guide on how to set up and solder the MOSFET since it's not a plug and play type?
The main problem this card has is there are a lot of good low cost demons that you now can't play since you HAVE to high roll or playing this is going to lose you the game. I think as a 3/3 this could have seen play, but a 2/2 is just so bad for 5 mana.
Uh...

Way too much name value in most expert rankings  I don't see any reason for Dez to still be in tier 4 for example when he went for 4-39 yards against Washington last time
I must say this is a very disproportionate response.  I’m sorry I hurt your feelings. I forgive you for the things you said here.  I understand your emotions were overwhelming your sense of decorum.   As to effort, I believe that if you check the math*, a person who gets more Inago Loops will have more chances for an Imago Loop.  The expected payout of a random occcurrence does increase with iterations.  Dim witted piece of shit that I am, I still can grasp that.  * I’m legit happy to walk through the math if you’d like

Yeah but you also don't compare 0 to 60 times on a Prius and a Leaf.  The iPhone has lower exposure, and thus gets to use a lower ISO retaining more detail and having less noise. The fact that you don't know the trade off is exposure means you just haven't been reading anything I've been saying. 
This definitely has the look of "was on ambien," however, and I don't even say this with "for ambien art" as a reference point, but I genuinely like it. It's actually put together quite well. Some of the shapes resemble things, and can't really be solidified as to what they are. However not only does it work here, but the way they are organized on the canvas is actually aesthetically very good. Like for real, if this was on a larger/better canvas, I'd honestly buy this. For real, good work mate.   Edit: look into jean Michael basquiat's artwork. He's one of my favs and this reminds me of his stuff in a way. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, or sound patronizing (I'm really not trying to be), but I wish I could create something this good on something that fucks you up as much as ambien. Idk if u regularly do art anyway, but if u keep working I think you could actually really do some stuff with this style.

Here for Zinkhan. Scary. Also check out in the 70s when there was a hired hit man to take out a local businessman downtown. He was hired by rival store owner. Finally caught when hit man blabs about the job while drinking in a bar. Both go to prison. Rica businessman escapes, is discovered 10 years later out west when story of the crime shows up on a unsolved crime drama. 
This is amazing, I saw this video a few days ago and I had thought it had been pirated by some person with a Smurf icon and silly random name, this explanation changed my view on that entirely.

The [Run! BTS! Variety Web Series](http://m.vlive.tv/video/21933/playlist/27764) has superseded Weekly Idol as the main way I satisfied my variety fix. Even before I called myself a fan of the group, I watched it and thought the games and missions were fun. Now that I know the boys, it’s super enjoyable.   I also like that the eps are short, easily consumables episodes and it’s very easy to immediately access new, subbed, HD eps - no tinkering around youtube and waiting for subs.

Going to a therapist isnt starting HRT. The therapist isnt there to tell you what to do, they're there to help you figure it out for yourself. A therapist isnt going to coerce you into something you dont want or arent ready for, they're going to help you understand for yourself what *your* next move is. If anything, its a nice place to offload your feelings, which I know as much as anyone else is not an easy thing to do. Hell, the concept alone is terrifying to me - but it is genuinely helpful in my opinion. Just my 2¢

He's a Republican.  He truly believes that the best way to help the country is to take money from the middle class and give it directly to billionaires.  And, to take away other people's healthcare. McCain has also dedicated himself to the Republican party, child molesters and all, so part of it is undoubtedly showing his loyalty to them.

Our service has only been improving and speeds increasing. The only thing that is happening is articles and fearmongering from websites. Literally nothing has happened to reduce service levels, speed or inflate prices, it is pure speculation and fearmongering. We have worse average over all speeds than other countries and our infrastructure is worse because we have VAST amounts of rural areas and even our urban/suburban areas are WAY more spread out than basically every other country above us. Articles like this and people like you lack perspective completely. I am not trying to say the ISPs aren't fucking us over by taking tax money and not allocating it to the intended place, but your response of us having to "save the internet" is based on speculation of things that could happen and not on actual reality. For all intents and purposes our speeds and service levels have been steadily improving.
Thanks for your comment on whether you found it playful, I'll respectfully disagree with your opinion on that.  I would have no problem with Clinton or Obama or ANY democrat running referring to Republicans as enemies - isn't that what we are? Enemies? You are literally voting against the very foundation I believe America stands for. I'll still have a beer with you because I consider you misguided, but you ARE an enemy as far as I'm concerned to my future and (more importantly) my children's future.  I'm not quite sure why this is offensive to you. I'm not saying we're enemies at war or anything, but we are in fact enemies.  When the Lakers play the Clippers on a Friday night basketball game, they're enemies.  I took this definition of the word "enemy" for you from a dictionary:  a person who feels hatred for, fosters harmful designs against, or engages in antagonistic activities against another; an adversary or opponent.  Is this not what you would consider us? If not, why? You're absolutely engaging in antagonistic activities against me and you're absolutely a political opponent at minimum.  I'd leave the hatred out of course but the word overall fits the glass slipper.

Not a bad idea, somewhat like an anti-Kruschev. Maybe he starts writing more politically, getting a lot of public attention, so the New England government hires him to write propaganda and political speeches for them.   I'll make sure to brows that thread to get some ideas for more focuses, but ultimately the plan is that Lovecrafts health and sanity will slowly erode before passing away, handing the torch off to an even more radical Robert E. Howard who is so devoted to H. P. Lovecraft that he establishes a cult around him.

Okay, he's padded all his alphabay feedback as well as some reddit feedback I've seen. Good to know.  I've personally bought off him and have seen mentions of him around forums. Why are you acting so high and mighty and that your opinion means everything? If you think he has fake feedback then say it instead of being an asshole lol
I think thats a weak response and your trying to justify the situation to yourself. I could list a huge number of star players that bring bad media to a team, but the team keeps them around because they can help them win. OBJ, Terrell Owens, Ben Roethlisberger, Ray Lewis, Ezekiel Elliott is serving a suspension for beating his girlfriend and Micheal Vick fought dogs for christ sake, whats more universally hated than that? but he was welcomed back w open arms. And the point about his teammates not liking him isn't relevant at all, not sure if you watched or followed the NFL at all but it was clear most players and owners supported Kap.
yeah ive been here for all 3 year i was thwre for all that so i know how it was though i prefered the old way of berry gathering since now most of my heroes dont have any accu or eva berriers because of rng that system would have helped alot and the old rings can be used for doint stuff that no one expects since the game is balanced for the current stuff not thw old stuff like with classic rings you can get more CC and it allows things like 100% DR noel but other than that they are useless XD but your provavly right this is probably gonna be a bumpy ride at first

I make no apologies for my complete lack of respect for unionism, yes I may be a big Fenian and want a united Ireland etc .  Look, here's what happened. Its 18 months and not one brexiteer cunt has got the finger out and said boo about what to do about the border over here.  Leo varadkar said they will use their veto to put brexit trade deals on hold until the border is resolved or at least a guarantee is given on its future status. He then suggested it's UKs problems they can deal with the border. I would respect unionism if they took on board the concerns of the taoiseach and said "look we understand the tensions of both our countries, we will do our absolute best to ensure the common travel area is upheld" and I wholeheartedly would say dead in unionism, show us your hand.  Instead, we get the following:.   Sammy Wilson dup: "HES MORE OF COWBOY THAN AN INDIAN".   Lord kilcooney ex uup (in relation to coveny saying he would like to see a united Ireland in his life): Simon Coveney is stirring things up . Very dangerous non statesman like role! Clearly hoping to undermine the Indian"   Ian paisley jr. Dup: UK should make life  hard for the south in response to disgraceful behaviour"   So yes that was a rant of sorts, but yeah I don't see them in a united Ireland. I want to , absolutely . But how?!
And yet, any city that tries to build their own alternative municipal internet is roadblocked by Republicans.

I haven't worked a "real job" in 5 years so I'm not worried about that. Last year I spent 6 months thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. I'd spend that time traveling on the cheap. Lots of thru-hikes, lots of adventures in foreign countries where my USD goes a lot further. Basically, live life while I'm still young and able rather than wait until I'm old and rich.
&gt;Would I feel less embarrassed if I'd been born to them instead of chosen by them?  No, not from my experience. I'm not adopted but you can certainly be very, very, embarrassed by the family you're born into. For me, it's my dad's side of the family (parents are divorced) (dysfunctional, kinda white trash, none of them are able to hold down good jobs, divorces left and right, jealousy, selfishness, and my dad never really knew how to be a "parent")
&gt;If they aren't dropping real bombs on a low-intensity conflict, the will be dropping training bombs in Nevada. The actual marginal cost of deploying them for a low intensity conflict is mainly basing and logistical.  The rapid exhaustion of the US navy's F-18 fleet puts the lie to this notion.  
This is very true. It saddens me how hard they are to photograph.

Yes, you're right, drugs don't teach you anything that's not already there. Living a life without drugs is Noble and superior, no doubt. However, since these kinds of drugs do amplify certain awarenesses that do lead to self growth, it becomes another possible road for you to learn from.  Psychedelics just help you analyze reality because awareness becomes heightened, so issues become priority #1. You can't distract yourself on them. If you do something you know is not ok, e.g. playing a video game while you have homework to do, you will be hyper aware of how you are just distracting yourself and all that comes along with that choice. Not everybody is cognizant of their selves, there's a lot of people who choose to live a life of distraction from reality, it can be how they were raised i.e. the way their environment shaped them, or just... Unawareness. Not everyone has people to show them the way, but once you're tripping, your emotions become amplified and negative things become a HUGE event, so if you're doing something negative, that becomes an issue and you feel a massive need to fix it.  You also receive a heightened sense of empathy, it changes the way you see people and makes you want to spread love and happiness to everybody, you can see right through everything. Even beautiful people are so sad. Body language becomes very obvious. Jealousy and negative beliefs related to beauty leave you.  It's only a perspective shift, but it definitely makes you very sensitive to your environment, which is good if you want to use it therapeutically.  I'd recommend therapy first. But I can definitely see how using shrooms while in a therapy session can boost your ability to navigate yourself because of the way it makes you. I want to try that some day.

I know hindsight is 20/20 but seeing how good Mcnabb looked with a legit no.1 for just a year thinking about Mcnabb having one of those type of guys its infuriating 
You guys are awesome thanks for the replies!

I am skeptical that failure will happen at the screws.  if you want to spread even more you can put a second ring on the other side of the plastic and torque on the second ring, that way you have a very high load spread, the pressure will be lower (but you will probably not be able to simulate anymore).

Lucky Bancho claims ~810,000 active characters playing.  The first table's headers are:  **Region | Active | New | Returning | Subscribed | Started Stormblood | Cleared 4.0 | Cleared 4.1| Falcon Mount Holders**  Active characters decreased by about 23,000, and there were only half the amount of new characters from the October scan. The percentange of active, continuously subscribed characters by region were 69% JP, 55% NA, 51% EU. There tend to be more new characters on NA/EU servers; however, there are also comparatively more inactive characters than on JP servers.  He talks a bit about the congested worlds. Basically, Balmung = RP, Gilgamesh = raid, Chocobo = raid server before cross-server PF. Also talks about differences in raiding. Don't have a lot of time to translate it all, but he suggests JP MMO players tend to be more serious gamers in general, whereas NA/EU have more casual players, therefore JP tends to lead in raid clears.  Next table is how the world populations changed.  **Region | DC | World | Status (9/12~) [Congested/Preferred] | Status on 11/22-28 | Previous pop. | Deleted | Inactive | Transferred out | Subscribed | Transferred in | Returning | New | Current pop. | Decrease | Increase | Change | Lv. 70 characters | 4.1 characters**  As the big servers had their congested status removed right as he was doing the scan, we can only see a little bit of the effect on characters movement. Next scan will probably have more info.  Last table is Alexander/Omega Savage/Ultimate Bahamut numbers.  **Region | DC | World | Active | Lv. 70 | 4.1 | Cleared Gordias | Cleared Midas | Cleared Creator | Cleared Delatscape 4.0 | % of active characters | Cleared Ultimate**  Clears for Alexander to Omega are determined by mount/minion, and Bahamut clears by the title "the Legend".

Literally one of them consented. Yes, two others went to his hotel room, but when you strip naked and start jacking off before you've actually sealed the deal it tends to freak chicks the fuck out. I'm guessing you didn't know that.  The power Louis had over them was imagined, but sadly only one of them was smart/strong enough to see that. You may remember she was one of the four women who didn't consent, not the one on the phone.  So even when Louis propositions four women who never give consent they're still the scheming whores and he's the faultless hero? What are you, a trailer trash Christian?  Louis confirmed their accounts. If he was being slandered he would fight it, not just give up and see multiple projects crash and burn while his reputation was seriously damaged.

As a big fan for the games and show I'd say if you watch the show, enough has changed roster-wise to warrant a buy.   If not, I'd give it a miss. They're still on that "ultra-realism" hype train that slows down the action and takes away from the almost arcade feel of the older PS2 games.   TL;DR: It's different from 2k16, but not different enough for casual fans.

What you want is a Sno Park. Here are several listed as good for [sledding / tubing](https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/mthood/recreation/wintersports/?recid=52770&amp;actid=88)  as far as commercial operations, [snow toobin' at Ski Bowl / etc](http://www.skibowl.com/winter/mt-hood-snow-tubing) is the closest thing I can think of-- but it doesn't seem like you can BYO sled? idk
That is what I was thinking it is, but since I only flipped one burger the entire time I was there, I didn't want to guess wrong!

Both of my cats lose their minds if I'm eating chips. I don't even buy them anymore. I never fed them to the cats on purpose. I was eating guacamole chips once and one dropped on the ground. One of my cats took a bite before I could grab it and his eyes instantly went LARGE and he lunged at the chip bag. Soon the other cat wanted in on the action and to this day any chips I try to eat get instantly gangbanged.

Then if bass sounds fun to you (spoiler: it is) go for it. Contrary to what you might be told you cannot harm your guitar ability by learning bass (unless you give up guitar entirely obviously...) and most of the skills you'll learn on one will be applicable to that other. There's no downside.

My parents have both received public assistance my whole life.   That comes out to about 500 usd and about 200 in Food Stamps a month for my mother. And about 250 usd with 70 a month in Food Stamps for my Father.   My parents were separated so my father had to pay about 50 a week of his assistance towards child support. And I received free health insurance under Medicaid (CHIP) until I was 18. I also received free school lunches which is not a particularly common thing where I grew up.   There were many times when we had to go with out certain utilities or get food from a food bank.   My parents also suffered from severe mental illnesses which kept them in and out of state hospitals until our states hospital program shut down.

They didn't claim it to be random, and surely you must be a statistical genius to point out the first thing that would come to mind for literally anyone making any kind of statistical survey.   Seriously, stop pointing out that "the dataset isn't random" or whatever on every single statistics related post. They wouldn't do the study if they hadn't thought about that.

It's just not realistic to expect NA teams to field 100% native talent unless you want to see them perform as well as an actual wildcard region internationally. You'd get 1-2 good teams max then a bunch of bonobos.
Anime is typically a year or 2 behind the manga so that's a given. I used to be the same but I realized that for me reading enhances the experience of watching because there are beautifully drawn panels and it's exciting to see them animated.   Plus you don't have to worry too much about spoilers.

Hello, I'm kind of new to this Reddit, so pardon if my feedback sucks.  I do find that the video is so close to being really high quality, but there are just a couple of issues that need fixing.  First off, the pacing of the video is way to slow. I feel that you should skip the more, and not the be rude, boring parts of the process, and just show the main points of the creation. A lot of the video can seem samey for the average viewer, and can get boring.   A good example is the beginning of the video, where you hammer the metal. It's rather slow, even with the speeding up of the video, just skipping a couple of the steps could go a long way.  Secondly, this is a little bit nit-picky-er, but the color correction could do with some work, and maybe the contrast to. The video just seems a little drowned out, a little dark.  Other than that, I think that you could have some good stuff.

The sad truth is we will have to resort to some type of physical conflict to prevent NK from developing nuclear ballistic missiles.  Diplomacy hasn’t worked, sanctions haven’t worked, and waiting hasn’t worked.   What kills me is everyone is acting like US is pushing for war.  If that was the case, we would already have attacked after one of the nuke tests or the ballistic missiles fired over Japan, which would be more justification than we have gotten for past wars.  We can’t afford a war and we know it.  We are simply answering threats of war with appropriate shows of force, in an attempt to deter an attack.  We haven’t fired a shot nor intend to fire a shot. What happens if someone calls in a bomb threat on a subway? Every cop in the area is sent to the subway to protect and deter.  We don’t ignore the bomb threat, fine the person making the bomb threat, or try to talk to them about not blowing stuff up. We use a show of force to deter would be attackers, and take them down because, guess what? You can’t threaten to blow people up and then say the people you’re threatening to blow up are the bad guys.  What is the alternate solution to this problem?

I will be brief and direct:  Know how to clean and cook.  It's a wonderful feminine virtue.  Keep a good appearance at all times possible.  When a woman spends an hour in front of the mirror just for me, trust me when I say that it feels good, and I notice.  Same goes for style.  Heels and dressing sexy go a long way.  Maintain your figure. If you are overweight, go to the gym. If you are fit, stay that way!  Fit women are wonderful.  On sex:  Men love sluts.   We just want her to be our slut and no one else's.  Bedroom is a big deal.  If it gets boring or lacking he may find someone else. (I did say this was direct advice.)  There are other things to nitpick, but those three I immediately notice and feel proud to date a girl like that.
Of course! I can't wait to have a nice place for thwm where I can see them all the time.

Yes you can.
The difficulty I have with this approach is that there are so SO many ways to be complicit with and perpetuate systemic/institutionalized violence, and many of them are everyday ways of life for people who consider their own complicity as not that at all while seeing other specific configurations as the real problem. So like, it's easy to see how police are part of this horrific system, but in this broken system, the fabric of everyday life is so often dependent on living in ways that contribute to horrific egregious harm to others. Just because it's less visible doesn't mean it's less real.  Does that make sense?
Khali happened when I was in my 20's, during a period I didn't really watch wrestling very much. Watched when I was a kid in the 80's and 90's, watch some now, not so much in the 2000's.

I find that since a lot of people are skeptical of how Warrior's Mettle is worded I have completely ditched the bolters on my grey slayers and for 285 pts run them with bolt pistols, cc weapons , 5 power fists and a vexilla. Works great especially since you want to get into combat as fast as possible with those power fists. add 4 power weapons for +20 pts and you are back at your 305 pts with a way more efficient assault blob or give 5 of them Combat Shields get some cc invulnerables.

Wow I'm actually a little shocked to learn Iron Man was 8 years after X-Men. I was aware that a lot of RDJ's appearances as Iron Man in other films were little more than short cameos. But it's still very interesting to see the similarities in their careers as far as these two roles are concerned.  Ever since Jackman mentioned Logan being his last, it's made me wonder how many films RDJ has left in him. But then again, I never realized he's been at it for 8 less years than Jackman. And RDJ still seems to love it. It also probably doesn't hurt that a decent amount of his film credits are for small cameos
I always leave then at home :(

I don't live in the UK, but the rest of my family does (I'm the only one that returned to Catalonia). So my *family* is UK based, I hope that counts.  Btw, we're solid Catalan lineages from both sides of my family. We're proud of our culture and heritage, we're proud of Catalonia's economic and academic status in Spain, but above all we're european. We're not in favour of independence.  Anyways, Theresa May's denouncement of Catalonia's independence falls entirely in line with expectations. The independence movement has found extraordinarily little sympathy among world leaders.   But we're also not losing any sleep over Theresa May's opinion, since it carries very little weight in Europe.  So, long story short: I'm unsurprised, I agree with it, and I don't think it's very important.
pro tip: don't tell that to girls ever. at least not until you've slept with her. it's a turnoff for women to show affection that early. i mean, sure this is how it happens in the movies, but real life unfortunately is not like that at all.  instead, be assertive, decisive, mysterious, calm, grounded, passionate and fun. have good eye contact and good tonality.  it's good that you have the “not giving a fuck” mentality. there is an infinite amount of women - so what one says “no”.

If go to to training mode and set the speed to "x1/4 (Hold L)" then the game will freeze unless you hold L, which then plays the game at 1/4 speed. If you tap L for 1 frame (I think, it might just be as short a time as you can) then the game will advance exactly 2 frames. This way, you can see the game each time 2 frames pass. You can hold inputs as you hit L to make those inputs as well. Setting the speed to "x1/2 (Hold L)" will do the same thing, except advancing 3 frames instead. These tips are essential for labbing as well.  Using this you can easily input things on the same frame and see the effects without mods.

&gt; Ok, how dank is it?  I would appraise it as pretty dank. In all the best ways (for me).
I'd like to add on to what a lot of people are saying. The idea of value is exactly that, an idea. We as a society put value on everything even if there's no real value allocated to it. When looking at Government Currency, money is constantly printing out &amp; there's nothing holding value to that piece of paper. it's literally a promise from the government that the paper is worth something. It used to be backed by gold, there was a limited supply &amp; any paper or coins pressed had to reflect the amount of a physical material which every government in the world since ancient times viewed as valuable. That's not the case anymore and without a gold standard that we've seen huge inflation or "fluctuation" as you may say, Because all we do is print more. It also allows governments to get out of problems by "printing more money" which we've learned that it doesn't really fix our problems. The idea behind bitcoin is to remove the centralization of currency away from the government, it's backed by a fine number of coins that are allowed to be mined. once the number is met I believe that bitcoin won't fluctuate as much .

It is up to the patient to have their part in it too.

I mean, it varies, but you may want to try talking about this with your prospective HRT provider.  If they very gradually shift your hormone levels, and keep them in the lower ranges of the gender you are transitioning towards, the effects should still occur but most likely at a much more gradual pace. The only major concern you would really want to watch out for is having no dominant sex hormone, as this can cause a number of health issues after a while. There are a number of ways to play off or hide transitioning, however.  For a trans female, doing things such as binding, growing facial hair, and keeping a masculine haircut can help you be read as male.  Good luck!  If you need anything just PM me.
Well apparently it's really hard to get hospitalized. I showed the doc my cut up as fuck arm, I told her I was thinking of suicide, and I've been hospitalized twice. She just made me promise I wouldn't kill myself. Lol. I was like I promise with fingers crossed behind my back. It's a joke do suicidal people really just tell on themselves like that? I am now officially sure that no one gives a fuck about whether I live or die. Death in 2018 is back on kids.

&gt; Your ISP can’t shape your traffic because it is just one big fat encrypted stream. Since people also use a VPN to port into the office network and telecommute there are too many legitimate uses for them to block them.  There's absolutely nothing stopping your ISP from throttling VPN connections too. Throttling down to 10-20mbit would have minimal impact on most business users, but would certainly slow your torrents down.
Ware is a good player to use especially if you have some solid MLB options....if your running a 3-4 your outside LB should be able to hold up against the run which is what Ware was doing when Dallas drafted him in 05. He can also snag a pass no problem. Just get a good chem for him.
