I'm aware of the property rent, employees wages and the serving act. My opinion is if I'm spending enough money to enjoy a three course meal with a group of friends, I don't see much of a problem with ordering a pitcher of tap water for the group, especially if I don't drink soft drinks (so I'll just drink at the water.) Yes it comes in the pitcher and served with a smile but they tried to pass that act here in Ireland, and also implement *water taxes* and basically the whole country was having none of it and protested which ended in success.  Luckily I didn't run into any bother when I was in Aachen in Oct - Nov last year, the bar and restaurant proprietors where all very facilitating. Maybe it's just a cultural or regional thing
Good for you! Upvoted.  I think cockpit and webmin support LXC. Both require a web browser.

Oh yes. I love them.
So, your saying that because the police have been attacking people, they should expect retaliation?
Only you can know that. It took me years to come to the realization and then more years to accept that I was gay. I dealt with a lot of shame. I’m 24 and I came out last year. I remember when I first discovered porn when I was like 13. It started out with the straight stuff, but I was always drawn to the men and not the women. Then about a year later I strictly was watching gay porn, but I always attributed it to a phase. Then about a year after that I would can with guys and still through all of that I never thought I was gay. In my mind I thought that I would like women one day. Once I was in college I kind of realized that I was gay or bi (but I’m gay, with like a lime zest of bi/pan lol) but during college I had a very hard time accepting it. I hated myself for it. It wasn’t until the end of college that I started to experiment with dudes. Once I had my first hookup, there was no doubt in my mind. But honestly I don’t think that you have to do anything physically sexual to know if you are queer. It was a hard journey, but it’s part if the process. Always here if you wanna talk :)
Getting a gaming laptop is a pretty bad investment, unless you are required to be mobile or that you don't have much room to work with. However, modern gaming laptops aren't actually that terrible anymore. Buying prebuilt PC's aren't actually that bad but you gotta choose carefully with specific parts(sometimes companies cheap out on some parts), obviously building your own will be much cheaper, if you know someone who knows how to build a computer do that, if you don't you can literally just do some research and you'll be fine.
I agree that people should record people like her. I'm just saying there is some risk involved given how entitled and psychotic a large portion of the American population has become as we often see on this sub.  Also, people often get mad when they're being recorded. I wouldn't have recorded if I was immunocompromised. Maybe you would though and that's just a difference in judgment. All good.
Good even if you’re sarcastic it still looks like you agree, you should’ve considered that

I am very sorry to hear about your loss.   Carolina dogs are extremely rare, especially if you do not live in the Carolinas/south. A lot of dogs after multi generational mixed breeding pick up the traits and look of “dingos”.   That being said, I’m looking forward to his results. I bet he has husky in him from the double coat and curly tail. Also he has a very deep chest with a high tuck so I’m gonna guess boxer in there as well.

Starmer does have principles, though. He believes in the principle that Black Lives Matter, but also has the open mind to realise blind defunding of police is a terrible idea.  Of course we can always trust you to assume a disagreement of principles is the same as an absence of principles, can’t we Kes?

Idk, I got mostly D's on the test so that's how I got TR in the first place.   I would say that I'm tall compared to other women but my height comes from my torso, and I have short stubby legs (but a huge ass and thighs!!). What's interesting is that I feel like my body is narrow and lush at the same time lol. Like my waist on its own isn't particularly tiny, but it is when pictured next to my hips/thighs/butt. Or oftentimes I feel super chunky and thick, but I'm actually quite skinny in reality.   If it helps, [here](https://imgur.com/a/tTpicji) are some more pictures of me. This is all so confusing haha!
Cool, thanks!
This is genius
Abbott is a fucking idiot. That stupid governor opened up the state in almost certainly the worst way possible and now he has to reap the consequences. To suck up to Trump, he opened up almost immediately, said no mask requirements and occupancy requirements and said their will be no followup or punishment for disobeying occupancy rules and let the cities and counties to fend for themselves.  Don't feel bad for Abbott. It's his fault Texas is as bad as it is right now.

“I’m happy with whatever you choose”  If he insists, don’t respond. He’ll get it and will likely follow up with some options. Or, just state your preference, something generic and unromantic that you really want to do (e.g. “Happy to try French cuisine, never had it” / “an art exhibit would be great”—hopefully he’d also take you out for food later).   He should be trying to impress you at this point. A message like this is usually not a good sign. He could try for 50/50. Or perhaps he’s just being considerate!

The maple garlic was a sauce that coated the fried pieces of chicken... robbing them of their crispiness but I didnt mind :)  I've seen how people ferment garlic in honey.

1 They only have two each because Lorien wasn't fully reborn with the Phoenix Items. Only four or five were emptied into the well, so not all humans got powers, and the ones who did didn't get a full set. And not all Loric got more than three, Six only ever had Sturma (manipulation of the elements and weather) and invisibility.   2 It's never mentioned because it isn't needed in the storyline. It's not needed, and doesn't create a huge plothole, so it isn't brought up.   3 She guesses they opened it, they never find her chest so maybe the Mogs had it in their base and it's now under the rubble.

So many people treating her as temptation to waste pulls meant for IroYachi, but for me, Sakurako was always the main prize and I actually have little interest in IroYachi.  Eternal Sakura is simply precious. I love her MSS and her design is so cool. She has a good chance of dethroning my previous Best Girl (which is why I changed my flair and message in-game). Even her personal memo has probably my favourite illustation of any memoria.

I bought a harmonica thinking it'd be a super easy instrument to learn, that I could pretty much just start blowing into it and sound good. That's kinda true to an extent but I totally agree with you, when you start digging into technique and different ways of playing it, goddamn is it way more complex than I ever imagined.  Still pretty early on in my harmonica journey and have a lot to learn but it's such a fun instrument to play even if you aren't very technically adept
The real ones
The Yiga formed 10,000 years ago when the King Outlawed Sheikah tech.  The Yiga Grew 110 years ago when sheikah tech was uncovered.  The Twili backstory is unclear at best interlopers (Gerudo? Sheikah? Hylian mages? Loruleans? Zonai? ect)  Sheikah seem to have helped the light spirits make the Twili Realm habitable for the Twili, or the Twili included/had atleast some sheikah tech.   There is a pattern here.  Girahim Vaati Agahnim Zant Ingo? Master Khoga  Since we don't know who or what the Twili are in relation to other games/lore,  we just don't know, but it's different then you might have thought.  We can't say Sheikah tech wasn't used/banished before OoT for certain, but most people would argue that we can. We can't say what state the sheikah were in before or after the Interlopers but it's clear they probably had some tech, or the light spirits had sheikah like tech, or the Interlopers could mimic sheikah tech.  It's unlikely any Twili escaped the Twili realm after TP.
hey! happy belated birthday. mine did get better eventually but i hope your next birthday is filled with love and happiness. best wishes ❤️

Decoupling the backend and external application is exactly what I intend with an API between the two. While I am definitely considering the load on the backend, it's all moot if I can't first figure out how to scale the external app and interface with it.  So I'm trying to figure that out first. Right now Docker-py with an API between the backend that parses the stored settings of a user to a container is seeming like the way to go.

good day
Yeah, i was looking over the challenges. They replaced the atom rewards with.. a board game of rewards??? I havent looked over them yet.  This is disappointing.
I have only been trading for a little under 2 months. I invested only a few hundred initially until now I've put in 4,800. Although I've been up as much as 2k I'm at a pretty steady support of +800. I've only invested I'm about 10 stocks since then and only pulled out of one for a significant loss (8-10% I believe...  it was an 3x ETF and after over a month it's only dropped further). I'm definitely no day trader but holding onto a stock for weeks doesn't seem like a bad strategy. The amount of artificial pumping, even if it sends a stock up 1000%, has me extremely cautious.  1) If there is no significant news or financial catalyst driving the pump, I wont even look at it no matter what anyone is trying to say. 2) I opt for stocks that are very likely to receive news again and again such as pharma stocks. They also have great hype potential. 3) Make sure there is a lower chance of any dilution or offering (getting in right after one is the best imo). 4) Never buy stocks that trend down for years and have no major catalyst for climbing back up (excusing R/S). 5) Average down if necessary which means dont go all in at one point as well since you never know if it will drop further. 6) Depending on trends, estimate where your exit point is: - If it's a big spike then 15-20% is typical for me to exit (almost every stock I've exited from has gone twice that high... but I didnt have to worry about a crash). - I love love love stocks that show obvious accumulation because then the rise in stock price is also gentle and I can get out just as the institutional money has started to unload and hop into another as it's bottoming out. Rinse and repeat.  My strategy likely wont get me a 1000% return in a year but perhaps a couple 100% and in fine with that.

Have you watched the video? They are standing on their porch in this picture. If you watch the video the mob that was walking on the street opens a gate to this property (right at the beginning of the video) and walk right up to this house. It wasn’t just protesters walking by in the street, which if that was the case they have every right to do. What you don’t have the right to do is trespass onto private property and harass the owners. Also after seeing the riots and looting going on how would they know the intentions of these protesters? Now think about if they had kids inside that house. In the eyes of the law this couple had every right to take the actions they did.

Agreed. People are most certainly too invested in io score. It reminds me of the good ol Wrath days and gear score.  To anyone in the situation, I would recommend pushing your own key rather than looking for a group. No one is going to invite a 460 &lt;1500 io DPS to a 15 group. You’ll spend hours looking for a non existent group lol. If you’re 460, though, you should be good enough to push your own key to 15 and complete it (even if it’s not in time).  It’s absolutely astronomically harder to pug your way up as a DPS, but it’s definitely not impossible.  Like I mentioned in my comment above, I was lucky to have friends essentially boost me so I didn’t experience the heartache of pugging. I’m planning on boosting a Druid when I get home from work tonight (BfA is $20 right now and gives you a 110 boost) and not connect it to my main’s io. Going to try to pug my way up the io ladder and see how miserable of a time it is. I main Resto Druid so it’ll be interesting to see how differently it goes when I’m pugging my way up and not relying on 470+ friends to carry me to a passable level.

People were ignoring the “no dogs past this point” on the beach for 3/4 nights we were at the beach.  Never seen so many dogs at the beach before.  No idea if the rules were altered so maybe check if the rest of the beach was opened to dogs or not.

Why do they say no blood yet at Leviticus 17 last verse or close to last in the chapter it says if a man find an already dead animal he can eat it (not able to bleed it) yet only be unclean until evening?   And Jesus say we desire mercy not sacrifice?  And on the same subject jws say don’t take blood but allow a product called Hemopure which it’s main ingredient is cows red blood cells in affect cows blood?

And this isn’t English class this is an online forum. I didn’t know I was getting graded lol.  If I was writing in an official capacity then I would worry about grammar and punctuation But the information doesn’t change. And no I see it every day. I don’t need to watch the news. Yes people get scammed but if they would actually think do research and ask before doing something then maybe they wouldn’t be In The situation.   I am  paying off my loans as well and using pslf. Who knows if I might get screwed but still I would do my research.  And they can make better decision on places they choose to go to college to lower the costs of education and work while in school etc.   And I’m not dumping my problems on anyone. Just stating information  And they didn’t have their situation saved. They stated they signed the Papers and then realized oof. Yes this is an advice forum but you doing something stupid and asking for advice after the fact means you didn’t make the right decision and trying to get out of instead asking first.

Anything you do as a parent will affect your child greatly. If you’re gonna have kids and you want them to turn out mentally, physically and emotionally stable you better know exactly what you’re doing.   That means YOU have to be physically, mentally and emotionally stable at the BARE minimum. You are gonna affect someone’s life. The biggest responsibility.
[This video](https://youtu.be/VdkIhzwEKOU) shows how unlucky he was this season, the biggest thing a playmaker needs is to be paired with goal scorers or skilled players at the least, instead he was paired with body guards the majority of the season and they had difficulty burying a lot of his passes. *IIRC that video was missing [this goal](https://youtu.be/5bJadgdfnrA?t=240).   Jack is an extremely confident person and was always used to being the best player on the ice, I think him being knocked around a bit took a hit to his confidence which resulted in the down year. He definitely needs to bulk up and he’ll be a lot more difficult to knock off his skates, and he’ll be far more confident and dangerous so people should watch out when he’s on the ice.

Depressed bf here. Best thing you can do is try to get him help. Its what I needed and still need. And my gf goes to a therapist as well to better learn how to cope with being with someone with depression.   But he actually told you about it so thats good. The issue is the internalization of his negative feelings. Keep bottling things up and it will flow over. I used to have fits of rage and panic attacks because I didnt know how to face my problems.

How bout I do anyway?
White people are mostly killed by other white people. Same for black people, asians, Mexicans, etc, etc. Community and location determine the majority of deaths, and when caused by another person, being surrounded by others of your race means they're the ones most likely to kill you. "Chicago has a massive crime and poverty problem," is a good issue to talk about, but has nothing to do with BLM. That's just poverty and a specific location and the issues they face. BLM is about systemic abuse caused by racism from the white power structures in this country.   "What about Chicago" is just whataboutism, and has nothing to do with BLM.

7* Units should be more exclusive since they could have an effect on PVP while having a less effect on PVE content. Blazing Fest banners started to have some effect on PVP, more units being released after Tsunade V2 started to have better/viable speed with abilities especially BF Hashirama who is a crit machine and can one shot most units in PVP. Blazing Bash banners were always on a lookout to see how those new units can affect the meta which BB Pain V2 has and somewhat Itachi as well (if properly supported). PVP-oriented players always needed to watch out for both banners now to see which one will help out PVP the most especially players who lack Kage League units, whether they should spend pearls on Blazing Bash or Blazing Fest banners.  Then you get the appearance of Legendary Banners the one being 7* SO6P Naruto and 7* Kakashi. 7* Kakashi has some utility on PVP, he can almost KO any unit if maxed out his abilities, but can still be a victim of dodge and jutsu sealing. Kakashi is a great nuker in PVE, but he is not a must use unit to complete much of PVE anyway.  However, Naruto on the other hand game changing. His abilities makes him tank anything, health/speed is top tier, and if you build your team around him getting his ultimate off, it can guarantee you the win. He is also fantastic on PVE content as well. Don't forget 7* Blazing Bash Madara, now the developers are adding in 7* Blazing Bash characters? At the moment it is an old character getting buffed, but what is to say if there was a new exclusive 7* Blazing Bash character who can be as game changing as 7* Naruto?  As a result, there might be four banners for PVP players to worry about in the next seasons of Kage League.  Should they summon on the new Blazing Fest unit? Blazing Bash? Legendary Banner? Or Legendary Blazing Bash Banner?
it just says waiting for frodster on my end

The 0.3% listed as Chinese is almost definitely a mis-read for Native American, IMO. Even if you say 1.3% instead of 1.6%, that is still notable compared to most Americans.
So basically you team with randoms and *expect* to win? That’s not their fault in the slightest. Everyone always comes here to complain about this for some reason. I’ve been playing COD since MW2.

It depends.  If the game you are running is not so much the over the top action hero genre I can see what you mean. Although for me this is more about the general competence of an NPC rather than them being human or not.   What I will do is grant them an aspect (as in Fate) and in that aspect they can add a "wild" die. I do this because I want to keep full blown wildcards rare but I still want to have special NPCs. So for instance if the PCs need a special item repaired they might hear of a blacksmith in the next town who is known in the region. I might also just give the NPC a +1 or +2 based on them having a particular edge but be careful with going too far. I also tend to simplify my NPCs so this blacksmith might look something like:   * Garon the Black, Orc d6, Str/Vig d8, Blacksmith d8+d6, covered in soot, impatient.   This just means he gets a d6 on most rolls except Str/Vigor and "blacksmithing". He is otherwise just another extra but if the PCs really want their item repaired they might seek him out. If he becomes a prominent character he might even get promoted to full wildcard status.  I feel this gives me a middle ground between full wildcards and the extras. It also means that I can roll out in the open and not have every extra with a +d6 be a wildcard.
My phone is definitely not jail broken and I have the original YouTube and the tweaked one (in this case Cercube which doesn’t work (Cercube 5 btw) and YouTube++
I do that occasionally, not that bad.
Mate, I reckon you’ve described 99% of musicians out there.   Family and friends are big supporters and are a great encouragement. They motivate us to put ourselves and our music out there with great expectations and then ..... absolutely nothing. It’s so demoralising.  There are quite a few articles out about how hard it is to get your song listened to by the right people. And if you somehow manage that, you’ve only got the first 10 seconds or so to get them interested. So it’s tough to actually “make it”.  For me, I’ve just changed my perspective about my music. It used to be - I’m going to make a living off of my music, to - I enjoy making music as a hobby and if something ever comes of it then sweet.  Don’t give up, chin up and all that jazz. Make your music because you love doing it and let the chips fall where they may.

I think what you are talking about was on purpose by RJ. He made things with flaws, just like in our world, to show the fallibility of any system created by flawed people. The white tower, and every other system of power in the world he created, had its pluses and minuses. This is what happens to any system created by by flawed people.
The root problem is that the far left's (and MSM) agenda is being played.  The over sensitization to "racism" and the move to hunt down every shade of racism makes it vulnerable to trolling.  Those in the middle and right "get" the joke.  If white supremacy is real (e.g. organized and working to eliminate/subjugate everyone of color), then the far left has their work cut out for them.  Trying to shame white people for "privileged", calling everything "racist", is not really convincing the vast majority of people.  It's only alienating everyone.

&gt;The JRPG gameplay in 5 is quite good, though it gets worse in my opinion as you go back.   They rebooted at 3. Persona 2 is actually better than 5, though a lot less modern. The game is actually about adults instead of teenagers, so probably made for a different audience as well.  (The story in 2 is more “SMT” and thoughtful - 5 feels like they got all their info about social problems from Hallmark movies.)

AqAdvisor is great for general stocking advice.   You want atleast 6+ for schooling fish, and you can go from there deciding how many of what.   Personally   I'd do 6-8 bottom feeders   10-25 mid water schoolers   6-20 neo shrimp  Edit: you'll need to decide what species as different sizes and bioload of fish will influence how many to stock
Mm. Ok. This is good advice. Thanks. I do want to learn it without a motor. I was just worried about the pre-learned part.
Don't conservatives mostly have nazis in their party? And also have a creep for a president, democrats ain't better but at least theirs is just a senile old man who needs to go lay down somewhere.   The free speech ain't slipping hard, you're just being dramatic becuase people are telling yall that Reddit ain't an Anti-sjw haven anymore. That's how the world works, people change their views and become better people instead of constantly supporting rapists, racists, thieves, liars in the such.   Don't like what's going on? Leave. Go.

[Heres the article.](https://www.city-journal.org/white-wokeness)  Another good bit:  &gt;Blacks themselves are not exempt from these beliefs. When Gary Clark, Jr., a Grammy-winning recording artist, says that he’s worried he could die walking out of the house, and NBA superstar Lebron James, who has been glorified since he was 15 years old, says that blacks are “literally hunted every day,” they are telling black people that things are hopeless. If a black teen is struggling and looks up to Lebron, hearing Lebron’s proclamation can only make him feel worse.

Fascists of any kind really are masters of doublethink. As an example we have altbuddhists, a fascist group that believes Buddhism should go back to it's masculine violent roots. Their favorite spiel is decrying progressive elements of degenerate Western Buddhism, at the same time as they integrate the fundamentally western philosophy of fascism into Buddhism. Extra points if they are calling into question well attested millennia old Buddhist practice in favor of copying and pasting Mein Kampf into the Pali Canon.

Yes. Even in my highly progressive church youth group we still have problems with guys making sexual and sexist comments. They’re getting better (some were a lot worse in middle school). They’re getting better at holding each other accountable too.
Stopped at Gettysburg for the weekend at a small motel right next to one of the graveyards. At 2am I go out for ice and see this huge parade of folks all decked out in civil war era garb. There were easily 200 people walking right down the middle of the street. Honestly, after hanging out in the battlefields all day, I thought nothing of it. I gave a few of them a wave and they waved back. No big deal. Went back to my room to see of my friend wanted to go watch the parade.. But by the time she got her shoes on and came outside, the people were gone and it was crazy quiet, like all those people had never been there.  Another time, we go to Maine to visit one of my friends and help her pack up her mom's house. There weren't enough beds so several of us just slept on the chairs in the living room. So all night, the kids are running up and down the stairs, making all this noise because the floors are all bare wood. A few times they came running through the room we were in but mostly they were on the back end of the house where the stairs were. None if us got more than an hour of sleep all night from the noise. So, the next morning I tell my friend who's mom owns the house that maybe she needs to keep better control of her kids. "I don't have any kids," she blinks as I realize that yeah, I haven't seen any kids since we arrived. "Those were probably the kids from next door," she says after a minute. "They drown back in the 1900s but still hang around between her house and the one next door."

Read it in Power To The People, but as with other books by Pavel, the data originated somewhere else and I don't remember the source offhand.  I guess you're referring to research from more recent years, which does indicated high muscle mass to bodyfat ratio is good for the heart, but they didn't seem to say anything about what happens to guys who blow up to Arnold size instead just a decently athletic look - assuming it was done w/o steroids or other drugs.
I dunno, it's probably fine if they're still willing to hire you. If they're willing to hire you *today*, you're probably safe.

Just a theory: she and/ or James might have reached out to some drama channels and got them on pay roll to push the narative of being "manipulated" and "on pay roll" by Jeffree. Then waited till people buy that narative, throw in some twitter bots to get old video of Dawson on surface, get people against them and then release the video.

Do you tend to believe everything you hear?
It’s pretty easy. I have a 5 star island. You need to have lots of trees, flowers, and furniture items decorating your island, but not too many clumped together. My island isn’t perfect in my eyes and just feels like a mess, but it’s a 5 star so I’ve been getting Lily’s of the valley which spawn on cliff edges when you get a 5 star island.
Yeah it has little damage output, even if you land all 3 shots you won’t down them

&gt;Supported the initial ahistorical reinterpretation of the 2nd amendment.   Just because you read a blog post in it doesn't make it true...  All the Judicial, Statutory, and Historic evidence from the 17th Century to Modern day supports the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.  Being a direct descendant of the English colonies American law is based off of the English model. Our earliest documents from the Mayflower compact to the Constitution itself share a lineage with the Magna Carta. Even the American Bill of Rights being modeled after the English Bill of Rights.  The individual right, unconnected to milita service, pre-exists the United States and the Constitution. This right is firmly based in English law.   [In 1689 The British Bill of Rights gave all protestants the right to keep and bear arms.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689)  ["The English right was a right of individuals, not conditioned on militia service...The English right to arms emerged in 1689, and in the century thereafter courts, Blackstone, and other authorities recognized it. They recognized a personal, individual right." -  CATO Brief on DC v Heller]( http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuCATOInstJMalcolm.pdf)  Prior to the debates on the US Constitution or its ratification multiple states built the individual right to keep and bear arms, unconnected to militia service, in their own state constitutions.  ["That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State" - chapter 1, Section XV, Constitution of Vermont - July 8, 1777.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/vt01.asp)  ["That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state" - A DECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OR STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, Section XIII, Constitution of Pennsylvania - September 28, 1776.](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/pa08.asp)  Later the debates that would literally become the American Bill of Rights also include the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  ["And that the said Constitution never be constructed to authorize Congress to infringe on the just liberty of the press, or the rights of the conscience; or prevent of people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms; or to raise standing armies, unless when necessary for the defense of the United States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning, in a peaceful and orderly manner, the federal legislature for a redress of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures of their persons, papers, or possessions." - Debates and proceedings in the Convention of the commonwealth of Massachusetts, 1788. Page 86-87.](https://archive.org/details/debatesandproce00peirgoog)   The American Bill of Rights itself was a compromise between the federalist and anti-federalist created for the express purpose of protecting individual rights.  ["In the ratification debate, Anti-Federalists opposed to the Constitution, complained that the new system threatened liberties, and suggested that if the delegates had truly cared about protecting individual rights, they would have included provisions that accomplished that.  With ratification in serious doubt, Federalists announced a willingness to take up the matter of  a series of amendments, to be called the Bill of Rights, soon after ratification and the First Congress  comes into session.  The concession was  undoubtedly  necessary to secure the Constitution's hard-fought ratification.  Thomas Jefferson, who did not attend the Constitutional Convention, in a December 1787 letter to Madison called the omission of a Bill of Rights a major mistake: "A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth."](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/billofrightsintro.html)  In Madison's own words:  [“I think we should obtain the confidence of our fellow citizens, in proportion as we fortify the rights of the people against the encroachments of the government,” Madison said in his address to Congress in June 1789.](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/on-this-day-james-madison-introduces-the-bill-of-rights)  Madison's first draft of the second Amendment is even more clear.  ["The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country; but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms shall be compelled to render military service in person."](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=001/llac001.db&amp;recNum=227)  Ironically it was changed because the founders feared someone would try to misconstrue a clause to deny the right of the people.  [*"Mr. Gerry -- This declaration of rights, I take it, is intended to secure the people against the maladministration of the Government; if we could suppose that, in all cases, the rights of the people would be attended to, the occasion for guards of this kind would be removed. Now, I am apprehensive that this clause would give an opportunity to the people in power to destroy the Constitution itself. They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous and prevent them from bearing arms."* - House of Representatives, Amendments to the Constitution 17, Aug. 1789](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendIIs6.html)  Please note Mr. Gerry clearly refers to this as the right of the people.  This is also why we have the 9th Amendment.  ["The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/United_States_of_America_1992)  Article I Section 8 had already established and addressed the militia and the military making the incorrect collective militia misinterpretation redundant.  Supreme Court cases like US v. Cruikshank, Presser v. Illinois, DC v. Heller, and even the Dredd Scott decision specifically call out the individual right to keep and bear arms unconnected to militia service.  [This is further evidenced by State Constitutions including the Right to keep and bear arms from the Colonial Period to Modern Day.](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statedat.htm)  [“The Constitutions of most of our states assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves, in all cases to which they think themselves competent, (as in electing their functionaries executive and legislative, and deciding by a jury of themselves, both fact and law, in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved) or they may act by representatives, freely and equally chosen; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed; that they are entitled to freedom of person; freedom of religion; freedom of property; and freedom of the press. in the structure of our legislatures we think experience has proved the benefit of subjecting questions to two separate bodies of deliberants; ...” - Thomas Jefferson’s letter to John Cartwright, on June 5th, 1824](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-4313)

Your particular skill of writing in a highly confident fashion while being factually wrong about every topic is actually pretty impressive.   For the record... a far left Booker had no way of doing better than more moderate McGrath in a State that you even claim is strongly republican. Polls show McGrath could very well give McConnell a run based on the current political environment. KY just elected a Democratic governor last year and the state's polling numbers for Trump have consistently shrunk since his election in 2016. As of April his approval/disapproval rating in KY was 45% to 45%.

&gt;Disabled dog abandoned in São Leopoldo has 20 interested  Animal Protection Secretariat has scheduled interviews with potential adopters this week.  Tintin is taken care of by the Municipal Kennel team.  Police investigate abuse by guardians.  At least 20 people showed interest in adopting Tintin, the dog with disabilities in the front legs abandoned twice in the same day in São Leopoldo, in the Metropolitan Region of Porto Alegre.  On Monday (6), the Animal Protection Secretariat (Sempa) scheduled interviews with possible adopters until Friday.   Sempa is in no hurry to find a new home for the dog.  So that Tintim does not run the risk of abandonment for the third time, Secretary Anderson Ribeiro decided to apply a questionnaire to distinguish who wants and is able to adopt the animal from whom he was just moved by the repercussion of the case.   "He is very well in our care and will only be released to those who really deserve it", highlights the secretary.   Sempa should investigate whether there are street or community animals where the adopting family lives, whether there are more animals in the house, what their temperament and size, if they are adopted, among other issues.   "It is more the social aspect that will be taken into account," says Anderson.  "There is no logic, for example, to have five animals in front of the house, not to give water, not to adopt, and to adopt Tintin because he is famous. First adopt the animal from your street", says the secretary.   "Therefore, the process will be conducted calmly and calmly and the family history will be evaluated very well."   Another care that the secretary emphasizes is the requirement for a type of floor that suits the dog's needs.  “Due to the deficiency in his paws, he drags his neck a lot on the floor.  The adopter's home must have tiled floors, with no gravel or grooves to avoid hurting his neck.  We want conscious adoption. ”   On social media, in the profile of the NGO Ampara Animal, the actress and comedian Tatá Werneck also showed interest in adopting the dog.   The 1st São Leopoldo Police Station received the police report and investigates the case.  Witnesses have already been summoned to give evidence.   According to delegate Ivair Matos, the police investigates possible ill-treatment, a crime provided for in the Environmental Crimes Law, whose penalty varies from three months to one year in prison and a fine.   Despite the commotion perceived by the secretary in recent days, the secretary for Animal Protection hopes that this will alert to other adoptions.  “The kennel has 30 amputated animals, another 20 with paralysis, and 10 that are blind.  Therefore, we have other dogs with difficulties similar to Tintin's that need shelter ”, stresses Anderson.   Tintim awaits adoption at São Leopoldo kennel   Sempa estimates that there are about 6,000 homeless dogs in São Leopoldo.  Of these, 300 are in the municipal kennel.   Those interested in adopting Tintin or another dog should schedule an interview

bladestorm isn't a particularly great choice for GC unfortunately. the mirages continue to be considered in existence as long as their storms exist, and as soon as you use GC again and overwrite those old mirages, the old storms instantly disappear. this means you'll never have more than 5 (or 6 w/ ench) storms active from your mirages, regardless of how fast you summon new mirages or how long your storms should be able to last

People out here acting like the OAD rule is gone. Until it is changed, then he is going to college. He already said he doesn’t think the G league is for him. Technically he could just sit out and train for a year but I think Zion is a perfect example about how you can build a brand in college. Oh yeah and Woj even said on his podcast that the OAD rule is likely being tabled to the 2025 cba negotiations.

You did all that mess soldering?
I actually had a conversation something like this today.  It went something like...  Them: everything is the Democrats fault.   Me: Who do you think is in charge?  Them: Nancy Pelosi.   Me: No, she's in charge of the house, not the government.   Them: Well, who's in charge of New York?  Me:New York, the state?  Them: A democrat.  Me: You think the US is ran by Andrew Cuomo?  Them: They started Corona.  Also them: I'm not racist, but all black people want to be on welfare, and steal, I know because I have black friends.

Look you can wax lyrical all day about batting, but at the end of the day, these blokes are wicketkeepers. Foakes had a mediocre season with the bat, but he's a wicketkeeper. He should be picked for his keeping first and foremost. And he's streets ahead of both Bairstow and Buttler with the gloves. There's something integrally wrong with English cricket if they're picking blokes for their secondary job.  During Australia's Gilchrist era, there was a fella kicking about in reggies called Darren Berry, who is widely considered to be Australia's best pure keeper of the past 20 years, probably since Healy. Some reckoned he was better than Rod Marsh. He was brilliant. He never played a test. Gilchrist was a pretty good keeper, but he wasn't great - Berry was way better. Berry was a meh bat, though. He only averaged 21 in first class cricket. But Gilchrist averages 48 in tests. For a good keeper, to average nearly 50? That's nearly impossible to refuse. In cases like those, you've gotta go with the better bat.  Similar situation here. But Buttler? He averages 31 in tests, not 48. And Foakes? He averages 38 in FC, not 21. It's a no-brainer, really.
Oh yeah... He definitely needs to nope outta thos mess.
Thanks for the Masterballs!

The problem here is not that there will be some emissions but that they lied about it. The environmental study they are producing for the project is about disclosure to the public, not compliance to a certain standard. They were knowingly over promising. That is to say, Balmer and his development team were. Obviously the Clipper org itself is not a developer or environmental consultant.

I personally don’t think it is, but around the time of this particular case there were about 4-5 other homicides in that same area with similarities, but due to the victim’s demographics it’s written off as gang violence...most gang members there are shooting like the OK Corral not really setting kids on fire.

I wasn't even talking about her pushing herself too hard. I was referring to how the in-universe reason for her taking a 180 on her character development from Worm is that she stops improving as a person the instant she starts to think her mistakes are fixable again.   It happened when her 'irrevocable' action of making Victoria the Wretch was undone at the end of Gold Morning, and it's going to happen again now that Kenzie is resurrecting Hunter after Amy's 'irrevocable' mistake of breaking her mind in a way that resulted in her becoming a titan.

For both Jennifer and Jordyn’s pregnancy announcement he talked about wanting to show people the pregnancy test  but Michelle said no.  Like really dude?
they/them has been used as a term to refer to a single person of unknown gender for decades, even centuries.  For example:  'That Driver must've been drunk, THEY couldn't drive straight.'  Or:  'Who are THEY?'  Grammatically there is a difference between they and they, plural and singular. You can't change the fact that non-binary people exist, and you can't change the fact that they/them pronouns are the most logical pronouns to refer to them with.  That you posted a hateful and ignorant comment on a sub which is focused around being inclusive and accepting is hilariously ironic, perhaps you should act more like other posts on this subreddit.

I absolutely despise communism, but it’s unfair to compare it to Nazism, at least in theory. Communism, theoretically, simply argues for the workers to control the means of production, there’s nothing *inherently* evil with communism. Did it fail and kill millions of people in the process? Yes, but there’s nothing wrong with discussing communist theory.  However, Nazism is inherently evil, as it calls for the genocide of inferior races.  But I do think the tankie subs should be banned. They do regularly call for violence, defend dictators and regimes no better than Hitler’s Germany, and deny genocides.

My eye's are on fire. And I'm going to hell for what I have witnessed.
The number of new cases per day was supposedly falling for a while. This is not the same as the number of cases falling. There were still more sick ppl each day than the day before, just a smaller increase. According to numbers I don’t trust ...   The “president” was advocating for less testing for a long time.   If they were serious about stopping Covid then there would be literally 100million covid tests per day in the USA. Which sounds like a lot but it’s literally where we would be if our government wasn’t stupid and trump obsessed and Russian controlled.

They could if they wanted to..? There’s just generally no reason for players to decide to withhold that information on regular injuries any other year, so they don’t withhold their diagnosis. Might be a shocking thing to you but you realize there’s plenty of things players may get diagnosed with, that they choose not to disclose to the entire world if it isn’t a baseball related injury or maybe something like a stomach virus that causes them to miss a game or two. Nor should any fan feel entitled to know every single diagnosis and detail about the players health overall.   If you found out you had an STD, would you go into work and announce to everyone at your job you have one, or would you only tell the relevant and necessary people AKA the short cute blonde you work with and casually fuck after work once and a while? I’m guessing only tell the necessary people. It’s no different with a player and COVID, the team and players and league would know but there’s no reason or obligation to tell the entire world.

This picture is from a couple days ago and the mead is currently sitting in two one-gallon carboys for secondary. I got about 1.7 gallons yield from a 3.0-3.3-gallon primary (tough to measure with co2 pushing the cap up) and topped off the second carboy by pressing out the blueberries and racking onto some campden in the hopes I avoid oxidation. At worst, I have at least one carboy that won't oxidize. I will say, this community is incredible. I have learned so much lurking for the last couple months that I was confident enough to go after a no-water mead for my first shot at meadmaking. Luckily for me, the fermentation was low and slow and produced (other than Blue Berry White) the best melomel I've ever had straight out of primary! No jet fuel! Between Tosna, YAN calculations, punchdown schedules, fruit treatment (freezing and thawing), etc., you all lay a pretty incredible blueprint for the beginning meadmaker. Anyway, I cannot attest to how balanced this will be once it clears (I imagine the blueberry matter in suspension made it come off more tannic than the finished product will be), so I might add oak at next racking and maybe even an acid treatment at bottling. Who knows. Recipe is as follows:  12 pounds orange blossom honey  19.6875 pounds wild blueberries, frozen and thawed  2 packets Lalvin 71b rehydrated with Tosna calculator's recommended amount of goferm and  fermented at 64 center of must  Tosna 2.0 targeting 150ppm YAN (wasn't sure if this was ideal, but it worked) with a mix of Fermaid K and DAP  Twice daily punchdown/degas for the first week  Volume was somewhere between 2.9 and 3.3 gallons. I wasn't too strict about determining exact volume and only thought to do so once the fruit cap was elevated. I do not know the starting gravity, but it finished a touch over 1.060, right where I wanted it. Anyway, that's my Ted Talk. Thank you all for being a phenomenal resource for newbies. I read The Compleat Meadmaker, but I honestly think that almost all the knowledge I used to make my first mead came from here. Cheers! -Matt

I’m not sure where you’ve been, but Indeedee-F has been the dominant choice for TR teams for months. I feel like the offensive redirection role you’re suggesting for Indeedee-F is probably better filled by Togekiss, which has greater bulk, substantially higher SpAtk, and a better typing. Indeedee-F only really has Psychic Surge+Expanding Force over Togekiss, which I don’t see as a worthy tradeoff.

They had a whole preliminary hearing on June...4th I believe. Look up that hearing and you will see how foolish your claims are.   I very much doubt you know as much about this case as you claim if you still believe the chase began for any other reason than what Greg claimed when be thought he was free.   I've also followed this case closely.   In fact you can check several threads (suggest those dated after the hearing) and learn more about the case (or less if you solely go to spin)  /r/ahmaudarberynews

Dosing of fertz is known to harm nerites, and indeed many invertebrates.  Tabs are typically the safest option if you have to fertilize and don't have a large tank.  Some people claim its the copper that kills the inverts, but this is unlikely unless you don't have a planted tank.  Plants will readily absorb most heavy metals, and usually the amounts found fertilizers aren't enough to cause issues (there's copper found in many fish foods as well).  The rapid chemical swings may be what cause the issues.   Additionally, a lack of GH or KH can cause issues as well.  You may have rapid PH swings as plants "go to sleep" for the night.   Instead of nerites though, I would simply use pest snails.  They are kind of a nuisance though, as they are hard to eliminate since they breed readily and some can breed asexually.
That's some quality bud!

I was going to ask if you were doing any sort of fasting. I wish I'd found it at your age, because I could already lose weight so easily. Seriously, at 21 I thought I had type 1 diabetes because despite having PCOS and not being overweight, I was losing 3-5 lbs a week with minor exercise and diet changes.   Glad you found something that is working! It's a lot easier to maintain than lose and I wish I'd committed to it back then.

Yeah, I never really worried about him because he reminds me of myself sometimes in ways and I see a lot of moments where he looks genuinely happy. I would only worry about an idol unless I found something that I truly thought was worth worrying about him. Times when he has his blank face people think he’s sad and that’s why I never listen to them lol. Some idols could be depressed and appear sad, and some idols could be depressed and appear like they’re the happiest and most energetic people on the Earth. You don’t know them in the end, so I never assume anything about any idol unless I found something that was a bit off. Even then though, you still don’t know them.  We don’t know Taehyung, but imagine if he was genuinely happy with where he was right now but then he sees all these people trying to claim he’s depressed. It would sure bother me knowing that my fans would be worrying about me when there might not be anything to worry about and then I would feel bad for them being stressed. That’s just me though. Who knows what Taehyung thinks in the end lol.

You clearly don't have any idea what you're talking about. If we were talking about opioids, you would be right but we're not. Specifically MDMA is quite self-limiting. You take it for long enough (as in 10 times in a month) and it stops working, also called losing the magic. When you have no serotonin and norepinephrine left to give you the happy feelings, absolutely no quantity will bring it back and chasing the dragon isn't a thing with Molly.Nobody steals to support their MDMA addiction. It sounds like the war on drugs propaganda really got their hooks into you.

completely disagree. you already have the two highest upside players, you need to build a team around them that will allow them to develop into well rounded players. the team doesn’t have any shooting and defense doesn’t exist. they need to draft players that accentuate KPJ , sexton, and garland, not actively hurt them

For all of that, he is a handy encapsulation of the failings of capitalism in general and the American trickle-down economics model specifically for the "working class." Beyond the tech staff, there's the warehouse workers. He's the richest man in the world, yet still has employees on government assist who have monitored bathroom breaks, no good healthcare options, and are actively pressured into not unionizing. Add to that, the company is using the "gig economy" not to ease the pressure on those workers, but actively let them go in favor of people whom they will compensate even less than that.  Then there's the whole Wal-Mart on steroids issue: they buy up so much competition, soon there won't be anyone who can reasonably compete. And the general issue of how he's set to become the first trillionare during a pandemic that cost millions their jobs. By no means is any of that unique to him and his company (except the personal wealth totals that is), but he's the largest, most visible target for the frustrations and anger generated by an economic system that's become so lopsided that it's on the precipice of teetering over.

Another advantage is huge reduction in rework. In single piece flow, the first plane would have a test flight as soon as it comes off the line. If it didn't fly then building the rest of the planes would be halted until a solution was figured out. And maybe only 2 or 3 planes would have to be remade (or if 1 person was doing the whole process, only 1 plane).  In batch production, you'd have all 10 planes built by the time you figure out something was wrong, and have to remake all 10.
&amp;#x200B;  &gt;  Yes, assuming, a consistent, true, genuine, loving relationship with Jesus. This is the hard part. Any Christian can claim they have such relationship, but they still desire earthly things, which is normal, but sometimes in excess, as those people you mentioned above. Even if say they genuinely do have such relationship, people can't avoid from sinning.   A no true Scotsman, or appeal to purity, is an informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample.   &gt; Yes. Because Christianity seeks to change people from within. The outside will take care of itself.   I seek to change myself from within every single day, and I don't need Jesus to be a decent person. I know I am not any better or worse than anyone, not Hitler, not Elon Musk, not Einstien, not Gandhi, not even Jesus, I am human too. I do not overindulge myself, I do not eat fast food, I do not eat very much meat, I do not drink except on occasion. I do not steal from people, I have a few positions, I give my time to help others when I can. I do not cheat on my SO even when given a literal free pass to from them. I am hardworking to constantly improve myself every day at work, NEVER accepting that being on top of all the key performance indicators is good enough. Finally, I am a pacifist and believe that patience is one of my strongest qualities. The only thing I am guilty of, in your Christian view, is not accepting Jesus any more than I accept Harry Potter into my heart.   &gt; I don't think so. I never heard of this, but a quick wikipedia lookup Hitler had a warped screwed up view of Christianity, and actually could be described as anti-Christian.   This Wikipedia is quite long and I don't believe you actually read it. I will grant you however that he did use the shit out of it to control people into justifying his own action. The Bible can be twisted in so many ways it can fit and be used to manipulate anyone when used correctly. That was my point bringing that up.

fwiw with a box end wrench and an impact driver, disconnecting and reconnecting the driveshaft is a less than two minute procedure.  Use the floormat from your RV to lay on while you do it. You'll spend far more time, effort, and money swapping the transfer case than you would just disconnecting the driveshaft now and then.
I guess my concern would be possible soggy brownies
Interesting. I live in the same area and my husband's motorcycle was stolen about s month ago.
Yeah, seems like a big problem doesn't it
Honestly I’ve been on gravel tires for so long this season that if I switch back to 28s for racing they’ll feel so tiny. I couldn’t imagine anything narrower on this

Here's a blurb I found that will be perfect for your resignation letter.  &gt; "Remember how long you have been putting these things off, and how often you have received an opportunity from the gods and have not made use of it. By now you ought to realise what cosmos you are a part of, and what divine administrator you owe your existence to, and that an end to your time here has been marked out, and if you do not use this time for cleaning the clouds from your mind, it will be gone, and so will you." - Marcus Aurelius

I work as an EMT so can explain this as I have seen it a few times.  Think of a hang nail but like 1000 times worse.  I have also heard horror stories of degloved penis, do with that what you will.

I may be wrong, but the fact that he doubled down was about the fact that he said "it's a straight up noose" and not denying it's a door pull. They still dramatized it for edge but the problem was the wording of noose or door pull. The right calls it doubling down to call that particular knot a noose. Even though it's the only door pull apparently fashioned that way.
How much was left when he came back?
😬😬😬😬 oops same

Hurt me more snake!
1. It wasn't that he forgot to turn it off. It was that he turned it on. We emailed back and forth this morning and then his voicemail and email both went to Out of Office. And I did try to call, I spent my whole lunch break on hold. Look, I get that there is a deadly pandemic happening and that everyone is doing their best, I really do, but I cannot explain the shit I would be in at my job if I dropped the ball like that by hanging onto paperwork with no follow up and not giving the customer anyone to contact (source: I have dropped the ball very badly on things in similar ways at my job). 2. I completely understand that delays are to be expected, and I tried to respond to your other post but apparently I was posting too much. I completely, completely understand the state of things right now. My problem is that both I and the shipper specifically asked - "is this guaranteed?" before paying extra for international express, and we were told "yes." It completely makes sense that there would be delays and that service guarantees would be suspended! The problem is that we were told the opposite and paid substantially more based on the information we were given.
Damn. Jealous of the 70s 😂

As someone with a VERY uncommon first name, NAH. Chances are the support person's auto correct removed the last letter and they didn't realize it. And chances are equal that they thought nothing of your misspelling their name because they are a support desk dealing with tons of requests.   My name is constantly being misspelled by email and text autocorrects because it is so similar to a couple of different names. It's really not a big deal. If it is someone you know who misspells your name, simply let them know in a polite way. Otherwise, it is truly a non-issue.
It is. Why do you think I don’t believe that?

it also depends on your relationship with your child, i’m very close with my mom so at first i could roll with them but after a couple years she never stopped even when i told her too, i will say tho that’s it is awesome you noticed your son being bugged by it &amp; stopped, wish more parents did that
I have tested it with SF450 removed from case and sit on the side while still connected to the motherboard. There's no thermal issue. And I put my hand on the power supply, it's very hot...

Well except the first response was to ask for room number, which is hardly evidence of anything nefarious. It will happen daily with all races today without incident.
I put down mannequins and filled in single spaces with weeds, patterns, and flowers.
Even without a design background, I think most players agree that the currently available skins are gaudy and unattractive. I like the modified EFX on the prime skins (requires Radianite upgrades), but still find the look of the weapons distracting and unappealing. I don't even know where the inspirations come from. Most solid sci-fi weapons models are inspired by automotive, industrial, and aviation/aerospace design. Half the skins right now look fantasy-inspired and I just don't think that works in a tactical shooter.
Oh yeah I forgot, it's President's Day

IMO these kind of posts just end up promoting cheats. Email Valve about it it will pretty much have the same effect.
I’d rather be dead than a mind-slave.  But I don’t see death as a particularly terrible thing - I’m very strongly Christian - so your mileage will vary.   I do find it interesting that you’re not as intrinsically horrified by being mind-controlled as I am. I wonder if it’s a cultural or a personal thing? For reference, I’ve grown up in the Vancouver, Canada area.

I work with unclaimed property in my job at a bank and these other comments are correct. You would get a letter (possibly multiple) before it gets turned over to the state. Every state has different laws and not all allow email notification for this yet. The low dollar amount makes me think fraud is not likely. That being said, if you are worried about it and don't need the money, you can just let it go to the state and claim it from them. They generally hold it forever until it gets claimed, so there's no rush
Me too! You know her smug ass wanted to correct him!
Not only the North is out to kill the Freys or unwilling to deal with them. Lots of Riverlanders were killed or captured, and honorable, religious and traditional people all over Westeros are furious. Look how the Valemen are using Frey as a insult, how the Sparrows think that the Freys and maybe others need punishment, and how the Faith Militant Uprising had great support from the population and zealous nobles all over the kingdom, even if the Targaryens had dragons.

Right they should’ve continued playing blackjack and had their house burned down.
Unfortunately there are many many many people (in general, not just PCOS) who are desperate for excuses for not losing excess fat. I have PCOS, age 34, overweight 30 years, and have successfully lost 80 lbs without any medication either. I did this by counting calories (I weigh literally everything I put in my mouth down to the gram) and being active, tracking everything to make sure I stay in a deficit. You know, science.  When I hear people say that they just don’t eat anything and still can’t lose weight, what they really mean is that they have no idea how much they’re actually eating or how much they’re burning, so have no clue what their calorie goals should really be. You’re getting negative comments on your post because it flies in the face of the excuses some people want to make to themselves about why they aren’t losing weight. Yes, PCOS can make weight loss a little more challenging. But just as you said, it’s not impossible.  I know I’ll get downvoted for this comment too, I don’t care. You worked so hard and I’m so glad you feel better about your weight and your health!!

Your brother's life expectancy is still severely shortened. Lungs are not like other organ transplants, the body *will* reject them eventually. It can be slowed by medication but it cannot be stopped. The *median* survival rate is 5.8 years after a double lung transplant. There is a very real chance that he will not make it to 35, and you need to accept that and take it into consideration.  If you really care about yourbrother you will understand that his outcome is better when he is mentally in a better place. There are few things more stressful than thinking that you could leave your spouse homeless and destitute if you don't survive another ten years.   You're going by the letter of the law and doing what's right for the *trust*, but you're not doing what's right for the benefactor of that trust. What is right for your bro is to know that his wife will not be on the street if something happens. What is right is to give him that peace of mind.   You need to be the better person. A massive trust will do your brother no good if he doesn't survive long enough to inherit it or if he can't use it to provide for his wife in the event of his death.  Buy the damn house. Put it only in his name with the stipulation that she won't benefit from it unless bro passes. Let it go to her if your brother dies. Give him that peace of mind. Would you really feel victorious if brother passed in 5 years and you got the whole trust and kicked SIL out? Would it make you feel better? Because if it does YTA in more ways than one. There's no way to honor your brother's memory by treating his widow like shit. I know you hate her, but this isn't about you.

The Slons Map is a joke map idea from a guy named slonssss (I don't know how many sses it actually is). Its track is a bend the length and shape of half the perimeter of a banana farm. It turns out the very first bit of Cracked is about as long as The Slons Map would be, meaning it's used as a way of playing the map without it being real (or only real in the PC of a certain QA who should totally try to sneak it in the game).

i love you ❤️
I said it last week and I’ll write it down today:  I would trade tens of thousands of ungrateful lying stupid lazy science deniers fucking about in bars with no masks bitching about their freedoms and drunk humping equally useless crotch fruit into each other while pretending to give half a somber thought to the idea of ‘old people dying’ for just ONE WW2 survivor.  Boys and men who died on beaches trying to right wrongs while women flew airplanes and made tanks, drawing stockings on each other’s legs so that the spared materials could go to the war effort - that was a time of heroes and sacrifice.  Tens of thousands of these weak, mouth breathing blubbery piles of litter and carbon emissions would never equal the value brought by one decent man or woman who put it all on the line when shit got tough.  You think that generation would have been crying in the streets because they couldn’t get a haircut?  Fuck no.  They’da been told to man up and join up - Uncle Sam will cut their hair free of charge if that’s all their puny heart desires.
Take Kyle Murray in the 5(probably where he is going in our league)
Weaponizing racism? The only people I’ve seen do that are BLM supporters and white supremacists.
Haha, fair enough!
Dispatch has always posted a lot of taeyong content it’s normal I swear every month at some point he’s their profile picture on Instagram. I don’t know if they do it for everyone cuz I only pay attention to dispatch when it involves nct but taeyong has always been a favorite of theirs so it’s kind of normal seeing that from them   I mean although I detest dispatch but sometimes they actually do decent things Im pretty sure ty’s situation is not the first time they’ve done some sort of investigation and or exposed things so those kinds of things are also normal
Impossible

So it looks like they’re doing it properly.
This, 100%. I work in a law firm with a DMS (iManage). Windows File Shares are a nightmare, but SharePoint might work in a pinch.   It is extremely important to plan and scope what you are trying to accomplish. A poorly planned DMS can be hell to manage. We have had ours for well over 15 years and it still requires almost a full-time admin to manage it and keep things running.
understandable have a great day
The problem is if they think they’re well above average then they think they’re too good for you. I see more below average guys that are demanding 10s because they think it’s an equal match than not. And I’m not talking about confidence, I’m talking about completely warped views of what they look like.

I guess I'd feel more sympathetic if her actions didn't directly benefit her and if J* wasn't already a known manipulative asshole before they were friends. I'm not blaming her if she was truly manipulated I'm just saying IMO she's using it as an excuse
Ye, different publishers, different subgenres, and different regions (RtH 2 is everything except asia TS is asia only)
Hated that story line.
GSR was $15, Atlantis is still $5.
Be supportive, like what the other comment said. You could also send him a little care package if you want to? Some things like hearing bad, ibuprofen, his favorite candy or a movie maybe?
I love mixing raisinets and popcorn. It's a perfect salty/sweet combo.
In that case yeah I agree. But it was a roster decision for one week. You got there without that player
Your words, not mine.
Currently watching:  * *My Girl*:  it's very entertaining if you can overlook the made-up-for-drama  manifestation of mental illness and can give your critical thinking a rest.  The  screenwriter is the same for *Romance of Tiger and Rose* so while it has a different theme, the tone is similar and is relatively fast paced.   The leads have nice chemistry, as it's their second project together.  And ML is still a good drama kisser  * *Parallel Love*: ignore some logic gaps and bad hair &amp; fashion, this is a sweet &gt;!time travel!&lt; romance.  Enjoy the sweet bickering between a competent female lead and a childish but doting male lead.  * *The Bad Kids*: the most serious drama I'm watching now.  Well-done weighty crime thriller drama * *Legend of the Condor Heroes (2017)*: I had long planned to watch some Jin Yong adaptations and was given an extra push to watch this for Chen Xing Xu (after watching *Goodbye My Princess*).  Refreshing to have such a badass female lead, but to be honest, the plot development is a little dull for me.  Starting soon   * *It’s Okay to Not Be Okay* * *Nodame Cantabile* (joining a group watch for the original Japanese version)

**BEYERDYNAMIC DT 770 STUDIO HEADPHONES** (80 Ohm) is on the DROP for 145$, and maybe it helps to choose. I'm considering buying it as well.
There's a bunch of different pieces at play here, so I'll try to quickly address each of them. I won't touch the newbie trying out a brawler part because you seem motivated to work with the class and understand the basic approach, if not quite the execution:  * &gt; "Why am I feeling weak now at low levels?"   Because, simply put, no martial character in the game is able to function offensively right out of the box. Dodge and Combat Expertise are both defensive feats, and one actively hampers your offense.    I think these are some crossed wires that come from reading guides that assume a basic knowledge of Pathfinder character design. Dodge, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, etc. are good feats for Brawlers to take because they open up other feats to flex into with Martial Flexibiliity. However, they are NOT good as the **only** feats a Brawler takes.   At a bare minimum, take the Power Attack feat ASAP to trade accuracy for bonus damage.   * &gt; "How do I level into the mid-game?"   You should also find an offensive feat chain to invest in to make sure you scale. For example, working towards [Pummeling Charge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/pummeling-charge-combat/) will let you dive across the battlefield and full attack for lots of in-your-face damage, or [Dragon Ferocity](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/dragon-ferocity-combat/) for lots of strength-scaling damage on your unarmed strikes when you use Brawler's Flurry. Or a feat chain associated with combat maneuvers, etc.  * &gt; "How can I use my WIS?"   A couple ways:   * You can just enjoy having a strong will save and do nothing.  * You can take a one-level dip into a martial class like Unchained Monk to get WIS-to-AC + some bonus feats if you're already unarmored (but brawlers are typically going with Light armor).  * You can take a one-level dip into a utility class like Inquisitior to get some skill-based utility, like using the [Conversion Inquisition](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor/inquisitions/inquistions-paizo/conversion-inquisition/) to be able to use WIS for some social skill instead of CHA, plus some free skill ranks.  * There are tons of cool [Style feats](https://aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?Category=Style) that have neat powers locked behind high WIS score prerequisites. The AoN link seems to be having some issues on my end, so a partially complete alternate list can be [found here instead](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/style-feats/), or by searching "Style"+"WIS".  * &gt; "How do I stay relevant late game"?   There's two halves to this: "Have big enough numbers to still contribute", "Lubricate your action economy", and "have out-of-combat utility".   * "Big Enough numbers": Accuracy is how to contribute mechanically to the game. If you miss, your action is wasted. Whether its an attack roll, a spell, whatever. Figure out "what checks do I need to pass to contribute" and keep that number as big as you can without sacrificing elsewhere. For a Brawler, that's going to be your melee accuracy which depends on your STR.  * "Lubricate your action economy": Actions the name of the game. You want to do as much as possible in as few actions as possible. Avoid anything that says "as a standard action &lt;mild benefit&gt;" because not taking a full attack action is going to be cutting your damage by 50% AT A MINIMUM, up to 85% late game. Free actions and rider effects are desireable.   The opposite is true for how you interact with foes: the game is about denying them actions. If you kill them, obviously, they can't take actions, but sometimes it's good to deny an action right now than to try to go for the kill   * "Have out of combat utility": Combat's not the only way to contribute to the game. Super late game, you might find it difficult to feel like a co-equal player to your wizards when they can stop time, teleport across continents and planes of reality, etc., and you can only punch for big numbers.    Even in combat, you might feel... hollow when your spellcasters completely debilitate foes with crowd control spells and you just clean up the mess. If your whole identity is "I'm good at combat", and then you feel you underperform in combat, you're going to get frustrated by that mismatch between concept and execution.    Invest in developing a cool charater, fun releationships, and ways to contribute out of combat: social encounters, environmental encounters, etc. Invest in support, so that the team's success feels like your success.
nice cake day

Damn the music kinda got me vibin tho ngl 😳
If it's not out by the end of the week, i'm buying on Ebay. I don't mind paying a bit more and having it now than having it in the middle of my semester.
You think engineering feats, including landing rockets on their feet and battery capacity innovations, are performed by middle management? NASA spent $100B to unsuccessfully do with challenger space shuttle what SpaceX successfully did with $100M. The lack of red tape and the license for engineers to solve problems is hugely beneficial.
API was down, but as of 11:30 BST it's back up.
I can understand that you might feel worried because there are lots of powerful people invested in convincing you that big bad feminists are the real threat. That fear is not based on reality. You are far more likely to be a victim of rape than a victim of a false rape accusation. You are far more likely to be a victim of assault than a false assault accusation. And if you do, in fact, assault or rape someone, there is a pretty good chance you will get away with it scot free. This is especially the case as a young white man.
hey your back
Because i clocked in? I don't get why i was forced to work 3 hours on my off day.
If I said "Me," would that be inappropriate?
Honestly, I'm just glad it wasn't Ninjara.  I hate him so much.
I mean in the same instance, Xehanort has had gray hair since he was born...  But Eraqus does have a couple of gray strands, right? Or is that just his hair texture...

Same here dude. Reminds me of Rod Carew. Underrated power if you locate PCI well enough
I love that they think it’s cool, but still posted it on shittycarmods anyways, as though the gravity well of scm is too great to overcome.
Sorry, couldn't figure out how to add text.   Out of curiosity, I wanted to see what the max amount of health a unit could have is, so I decided to experiment and got this Goku to over 4 million. Would any of you know any other combinations to get a units HP to the absolute maximum? Team viability is of course not taken into consideration for this experiment.

Any ETA on the patch??
I had this issue with the reset.  You have to do it again, keep it plugged in and wait about 20 min, then try adding back to your network.  I don’t know why it took 20 min, but it did.
So in other  word seither you think this thread is about your opinion  of me (and your own right to lash out at  me)  or you have nothing to offer to the subject.  Take your pick.  &gt;Please understand that I am not attacking you.  of course you are.  You've posted your opinion. I didn't care  and since then two more times all about me and my  alleged behaviour.   You could have stated your stance in  the first post and moved on to something substantive but you are choosing tostay on me as the subject  which IS an attack.  Stop lying .  your own presentation is clouding the point you are trying to convey.  Live by  your own standards.   You can't point out alleged obnoxiousness by being the same and be heard.   At least make an attempt to put something in your posts about the subject or you will be put on ignore to end this pointless back and forth.
nOo
This happened because Subaru was an enemy of Reinhardt(enemy of God basically), therefore as of now, being friends with Reinhardt makes it even harder to corner Subaru into a loop with no way out.

Pixel 3. It's happening since Friday. I just updated the app and the problem didn't go away.
As far as my headcanon goes, The Moment is solely a *temporal* doomsday weapon. A sentient machine intelligence, specialised in achieving victory through temporal manipulation.  And it has a will of its own.  As in, it has victory conditions of its own.  The war doctor didn’t come across knowledge of The Moment by accident, nothing that happens to The Moment is an accident.  The temporal vortices, lining up and priming the ideas of working around of Armageddon and of the paintings?  Absolutely intentional.  The simultaneous arrivals just in time of two tardises before the war doctor pushes the button?  It’s not just convenient - only advanced temporal manipulation could achieve it.  Everything that happened was planned by The Moment, meticulously.  The Moment wanted Gallifrey intact.  It wanted the time war to take that particular turn :)
Cannibalism is the best solution
Como va bro? si te interesa, yo se modelado 3D, podriamos hacer algo en conjunto, para que se vea mas atractivo el juego podriamos hacerlo en 3D con vista lateral, iluminación, etc. Pienso que podria quedar bastante mas profesional así, un saludo!
As a general rule, I don't worry about just opening spam.  Just don't click links or open attachments.
LGA 1151 and previously still crunches, on the edges of the IHS there's visible damage that every CPU gets when the socket cover is closed on it for the first time, which you can see for yourself if you have one. All 6 Intel CPUs I've used personally have had this happen.  AM4 doesn't though, and I'm unsure about LGA 1200 CPUs as I have not used one.
The main reason I still check Facebook is because I'm waiting to see if karma ever shows up and bites certain people in the ass.  I imagine myself telling them tough shit, you brought this on yourselves, but I'll probably just send best wishes for a speedy recovery like everyone else.
Oh fuck that place. I remember it was sunny and then we had a flash flood. 100 degrees+ and then instant fucking humidity. The swamp coolers we had really did their job..ghetto.
I occasionally get back spasms due to an injury suffered at a young age. It's pretty rare but it happens a handful of times a year. Once or twice a year it's so bad I become an old man, I literally double over in pain, I need someone to hold my hand to help me get in the car, I've needed help bathing (from a girlfriend, not my mom or sister like is the trend on AITA)  Usually it sets in overnight so I just call in sick but one time I had mild back pain, went into work, I sneezed, and next thing I know I was in so much pain I couldn't breath. I was really embarrased by it too. Like I hate feeling that helpless. So I tried to tough through it. At lunchtime I couldn't take it so I asked to go home because I was having trouble breathing and couldn't even work because reaching for a piece of paper or having to get something off the copier 5 feet away was agony.   They let me go home because I'm a good worker, and they trust me. I think if I had just said hey I just feel like using some time they would have let me go. But I was definitely getting the side eye and skepticism for telling them about my back.. I'm a young guy and very physically active so people don't expect me to be brought down by a "simple" back problem.   So while I wouldn' phrase as "Am I an asshole?" I honestly definitely felt bad about it and I was embarrassed. I can see how OP felt.
He smells like shit too.

We just flipped the handle so the locks on the outside of the door. With that said I do allow her privacy. If she wants to be in her room alone then that’s fine. Some days she will just sit in there for a hour or so and play with her dolls or read books. I just don’t want it locked in case I need to get in for whatever reason.
Nothing I brought up was about OTL politics, but while we’re at it, Kaiserreich as a game is inherently political, but the rule against politics is CONTEMPORARY politics (so no discussing how Cheeto Benito is a literal NatPop), but politics as it relates to the history behind different KRTL movements as it exists in the game is fair game.   The PSA is the US “Democratic” faction, that is a fact. Doesn’t change the fact that it isn’t inherently a Democratic society. (Jim Crow.) A society can call itself Democratic all you would like, and if you would like to make the argument that the Jim Crow Laws and voter suppression in the PSA don’t disqualify it from being a democracy, then go ahead. The PSA does represent the keepings of the US Bourgios-Democratic legal system before MacArthur took control, I’ll grant you that, however my argument is that this society is still Authoritarian, even if it calls itself democratic.
What happened is that the game is pretty much over. It’s summer. And there is no really hockey to speak of. 🤷‍♂️

Did the shop have smaller size for you to try on? Do you know if the shop is at all reputable? I’ve been going through shops past few weeks first looking for bike for myself and now for gf and two have tried to get creative to make clearly badly fitting bike sound like good idea because they didn’t have anything good in stock. What kind of criteria you had for the bike? Personally I’d never get a bike that has less than 2” clearance at middle of top tube, even though it’s kind of road bike, you might need to get your feet on ground on uneven spot. Hope you get things sorted out.
Omg he said "Like" so many times I couldn't finish watching it.
I totally get that. I never once argued with her on that. And I’ve expressed that I’m aware of the fact that she’s done more.   I don’t know what else to do other than tell her she did a great job.

"Closer" by Nine Inch Nails. If you watch the music video and pay attention to the lyrics it's very creepy and controversial.
Thanks for all of the help, I've gtg sleep now, bye!
Yes..much more. Last order and mars chronicle. The later is still running
Dude, I know the story and Martino is a first class hack. This is common knowledge. We will see where things stand as they proceed. No one knows what the bids are and who the real serious players are when push comes to shove.
So? Doesnt change how broken the champ is. Winrate drops by 1-2% and it comes back up within a week when people adjust. Give me a break.

I thought it would be kinda boring to add the characters and their correct names on the post
You’re saying Ameriglo SUPPRESSOR sights right?  I’ve also seen people using different plates as well. Some put the RMR on a MOS plate and then onto the slide.  I’ve seen the Trijicon plate that trijion sells and it’s WAY thinner than the MOS plates. Maybe this is why it’s hitting high?

No one would have given a fuck about dumbass conspiracy theories if they had free healthcare instead of rates going up for many people.  No one gives a shit what you do if you offer value to be completely honest. There's so many examples of communities supporting drug dealers because they gave back more than their corrupt governments were. Offer real value and the people will love you even if you're Escobar. The Democrats don't and the people see it.

They were on the western side of the mountain and not near Devil's backbone.
Yeah idk either. Also not a dr. internet dr says low blood sugar. drinking in excess causes low blood sugar. so I'm going with that.
Ok?
They’re perfect!  So beautiful.
This kinda makes me sad. (This is amazing btw)
I wonder who took the picture.
I mean come on.. first of all the guy with the backpack is putting items in his bag like he has 5 seconds of oxygen left before he needs to run outside to breathe again, and then by chance a guy with a shotgun also walks in. And then the two dudes suddenly both decide that they are gonna stop the guy with the shotgun, perform sort of a distract and hit technique that pretty much no one would come up with in a life threatning situation. The other fella then tackles the robber takes his gun and gives it to the store clerk. And this all happened in one smooth motion... and this is not somewhat obviously fake to you?  Edit: and ofcourse the hollywood style of throwing a rack on someone who’s on the floor
Nnnnnnnaughty
Well the liberals did give us s.33 in the charter so that our rights can  be squashed at any whim. I would not say they are  better.

And on that I agree with them. Never hurt anyone,  and if a dude wants to play dress up in public thats fine, But...  dont let them compete against actual women. Hormones, bone structure, muscle development etc are different,  and your average top 1000 Male athlete would wipe out the real female opposition. As a father of 2 girls, I want them competing on a level playing field,  not a skewed one. BUT,  let them set up own events etc no problem.   I am waiting for some tennis dude to realise he's top 100 in the world, not good enough to be #1. Say I am woman, take hormone suppressants for 6 months or so. No operation. Compete in women's tennis for 3 to 5 years,  win all the tournaments then go back to being Bob.
She is not! But she was raised by two MIT graduates

In addition, I loved seeing individual athletes from the ML teams competing in Marbula One, so I’d hope all the teams can stick around in some sort of capacity! Especially as a big fan of some of the lower-ranked teams, I like when they have chances to compete.
I assumed that I had chest hair one day, and I proceeded to go the the hospital for razor blading my chest.

I have to assume the room has three other walls you could possibly fill up.  Great look collection!
Yeah that’s what the TD sites say but I’m damn sure mine doesn’t last more than two days
Might as well put Mrbossftw on that list then.

Good question; I don't know. I see old creations under Search (scroll down to "all creations") - but I think these are only the ones I "saved". It does look like old unsaved ones disappeared.

Your friend may have been the one to summon her, but it was done with your material, your game and she wants to be *your* servant.  It'd be a pity to leave her alone after such luck, don't you think?

1000 - 1500 y puede ser que me quede corto
No bueno! y eso como responde la pregunta?  Dejame intento completar tu respuesta: "El Mejico que te enseñaron en la escuela" (el cual no sabemos QUE le enseñaron en SU escuela) "es un cuento de adas" (asumo, ficticio) "que se inventó el PRI" (ok, ya tenemos al actor intelectual) "para unir a los Mejicanos." (pero, asumo, NO esta funcionando) "En realidad las regiones siempre han tenido choques." (No esta peor! siempre ha estado malo!) "En especial con ciudad de Mejico." (x chilangos)  Entonces, en resumidas cuentas:  No me importa lo que hayas preguntado, asumo que te enseñaron una ficcion, como tal, esa ficcion no existe. Pero no estamos mal ahorita, siempre hemos estado mal.  Primero evado la pregunta, uso la falacia del hombre de paja. Despues aparento contestarla, solo para caer en la falacia de la tradicion.
You need help, dude
