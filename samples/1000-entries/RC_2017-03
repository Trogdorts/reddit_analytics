Correct. C# requires garbage collection support from its VM. WebAssembly currently doesn't have that.

`Item | orderDate | quantity | weekId | weekGroup | Quantity `  weekID is optional, but will help grouping of data totals. (suggest yyyywID e.g 201735)  weekGroup is optional, an indication of the 4 weeks group. Suggest format as yyyywg (e.g 201701) where *wg* is the week group Id  A PIVOT table will give you instant results on this data.  Functions such as `SUMIFS` `COUNTIFS` will give you totals as required.   You also have the option to have a calculated field in the table that will give a running total for each item/weekid/weekgroup.   Entering a formula in the first cell of a table column autofills that formula as you add more rows.. using WeekId and weekGroup as the identifiers you could have running totals using SUMIFS or COUNTIFS in that column.  `Item | orderDate | quantity | weekId | weekGroup | Quantity | weekTotal | weekGroupTotal | weekIDOrderCount`  as an example

It wasn't, but OP shouldn't have even bothered mentioning it if he didn't want people to comment on it.  OP mentioned it as an example to add color (and maybe even vent a bit) about the current state of BOH.  Nevertheless, the addition detracts from the point by derailing the conversation right out the gate because people are going to be interested in defending OS/belle/whatever.  OP would have been better off just outlining the proposed change and leaving it at that.

Sorry, just got it relatively recently. Only used it for trail use right now, overnight, though I did pack more than needed to see if it could comfortably hold a small Bare Boxer canister. But as a test I packed it for a long weekend and got it down to a Spirit Air personal item size (caveat: I pack light in general and used after-market compression straps to aid the bag's straps.). The comment about it being bombproof comes from comparing its construction to another bag I've used and abused for years as a camera bag, as well as seeing older bags from the same company that have held up remarkably.  All things considered, maybe it's not ready for prime time, then! Unfortunately reviews seem hard to find for this particular bag.

I've recently rediscovered Comus' *First Utterance* by coming across a copy of it on vinyl. The album is likely to be the most evil one I'll ever add to my collection, even with the moments of brief respite that are featured on there. Lyrically, it deals with taboo and transgressive topics such as rape, torture, and shock therapy, but it's really the gnarled and ragged instrumentation that lets the villainous nature of the record appear. From the moment I hear the strings of ["Diana"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aEpyhx_c7o) creep into view, I feel overcome by the dark energy that the record creates. The lyrics also portray the idea of lust as a ravenous beast that preys on unsuspecting victims (in this case, a maiden whose name is the title of this track), ceaselessly carrying out its duty until it has been satisfied, if only temporarily.   This album is one that I consider a favorite based on the sheer fascination of how human beings were able to conceive such an album. This is one of those records that I feel was never meant to exist, and yet it does.  Edit: Elaboration on the lyrics for "Diana".
Thanks!

More story content.  I love the main story but at this point I can't even remember where it left off.  Also, I would really love for later story heroes to get some free costumes.  I get why they give the same six characters all the free, useful event costumes, but I would really love some way to get different looks for the others without them being in crates.  in the same vein, I would love some sort of mini thing celebration thing that introduces all their original costumes, so the purple suit for Clint, Natasha with her fishnets, Jan with that red number, etc. I just think it would be really fun to see their reactions in game to each other's classic looks.

I understand.   Though, I feel like this is the most common thread---more common than every theory thread ever made. People come to this subreddit to kill time while waiting for book 3. Either they do this by discussing the book or they want to know what other books they should read to kill-time.  If there's any thread that really deserves to get the most visibility, I feel like it would be what books KKC fans believe other KKC fans would enjoy given their shared interest in KKC. Maybe there should be a mod thread that proposes the idea just to gauge people's interest?

&gt; Additionally, you can also make out windows below the penthouse breaking, indicating that the structural support behind them had begun buckling long before the roofline comes down. Therefore, it's no surprise the roofline would have come down with little resistance.  Why would the buckling of a few supporting columns holding up the center of the top of the building immediately demolish all structural support of the rest of the building so the entirety of the building can collapse at one time? It is in fact a VERY big surprise the roofline comes down with little to no resistance (remaining level with the ground as well), as that could not have happened without the simultaneous failure of the rest of the structural support of the building, which should not have occured because a few columns near the top center buckled. That was healthy steel structure keeping the building standing a second before it collapsed, where did it go and why did it happen at almost the exact same time for all of the rest of the supporting steel columns?  &gt;Back to the topic though: If "natural" collapses were truly impossible, why couldn't any of the various insurers prove it?  Because to go against the official story would put your entire corporation and possibly the lives of some of the administration in immediate risk. Also, it's very possible that backdoor deals could be conducted to insure complicity.   &gt;Also, the building does not come straight down. You can see from the other angles that the roofline caves in towards the middle and the entire building leans back towards where it had sustained direct damage from one of the Twin Towers.  The roofline caving towards the middle was drastically skewed by the perspective of the first film, in the clip with the angle of viewing that is level with the roofline you can see that it just BARELY, if at all, caves in towards the middle first, then the outside support fails almost immediately after that (which would not be explained by a progressive collapse, but would be explained by explosive charges placed on the center columns detonating slightly before the charges on the outer columns).

In this instance they're just doing an early exposure to sheep to see how keen this pup is (*very!*).

My confusion that perhaps u/iltdiTX or yourself could address is that it seems inconsistent to say that our border security is not good enough and that individuals coming into the country are not veing vetted effectively and then turn around and say "defund TSA" when TSA does exactly that for your plane ride.  I understand if you feel TSA is not effective and needs an overhaul, but if you're saying they need *less or no money at all* for this problem then I'm not sure why you're more concerned with who's coming into the country thousands of miles away from you than who's sitting next to you or your family on an airplane.
The good thing about gacha games is that you can always go back to whaling after however long a break you decide to take from it. New characters and game mechanics will allow paid users to catch up in no time.  Holding off purchases at the moment is, imo, the best  way to tell Nintendo they have to do something. Nothing gets game updates implemented faster than a drop in revenue.

It is still a vetting process that involves a commitment to showing up to the interview and filling out the paperwork.  Like if yours was cancelled suddenly, wouldn't you want a bit more information into why?
Cuz there are so many foxes and it is such a difficult matchup. If the best character in the game is on of your most difficult mu's you have to be very good to be a top level puff. Hbox is a monster and makes the matchup look even somehow.

It used to be that you could administer penoxy right as they got the disease and it would immediately boost immunity to 61%. However, recently I've been not seeing this.

you're not wrong, but I think there's a difference between letting people get dependent on a government program and then taking it away and saying 'fend for yourself', and never having the program in the first place. Most people that were previously uninsured likely haven't planned/saved for when the ACA is repealed.  Do you think there's a difference? I know your stance about this not being government's job, but the government DID prop up a bunch of people up and now they're going to fall. Saying 'it never should have been done' is useless when discussing the fall-out of repeal.  Anything about another country with similar conservative governance? I don't know how to efficiently google something like that!

Thank you for sharing all this information – this is really useful!  Our system is actually not _that_ expensive to train, although we have not yet done this from scratch. We train on 20 hours, but only need about 3-5 in order to get high quality voice synthesis results. We haven't tested the phoneme duration and F0 prediction models for their sensitivity to data. However, with something like VoiceBunny.com you should be able to collect audio for a script for five to ten thousand dollars for five to ten hours of audio. It seems like you could do much cheaper if you or someone you knew were just willing to set up a small recording studio and spend a week talking, but we haven't gone through this ourselves yet. You just need text and audio – no data annotation necessary, since you can use a phoneme dictionary and a grapheme-to-phoneme model for everything. If you wanted to, you could probably use LibriSpeech to get audio books and use those, you would just need to figure out how to align the text to the audio; I suspect you could do this with a speech recognition system (at Baidu we have our own Deep Speech 2-based systems, but you could train your own or use some sort of external speech API perhaps).   What we found most interesting about the 48 kHz model was that we have about 83 ms of context, and it works pretty well. This isn't an issue for SampleRNN, which has a very long context, but WaveNet has a fixed receptive field – and apparently 83 ms is basically enough, which means that the need for depth for high quality synthesis is _not_ from the receptive field, but from something else. We have some ideas as to why, but nothing for certain.  We're also pretty interested in seeing different uses of similar systems – superresolution seems like a pretty straightforward direction, as do GANs for phoneme duration and F0 (if you don't do end-to-end training).  Thanks for the detailed info. This is really valuable!
No I'm not joking. I saw the effects that hard core drugs had on my family and refused to do them. I only just smoked pot for the first and last time, a year ago. So sorry that I don't know jack about any of this, and obviously the people who were with me were no help. They thought it was fucking hilarious that I was flipping shit. Maybe don't assume that everyone knows everything that you do... I was just trying to post for some advice from people who actually know what they are doing... As opposed to me, who knows nothing about this and is reconsidering my decision to never smoke again (after the absolutely terrible first experience I had). By the way, I'm almost 30. 
Im planning to answer to everybody in this one because you`re all saying the same stuff.

My beard and stache too. I dont look homeless tho, and I have people who wants stuff to do with me, and if they didn`t I`d survive, although I appreciate and enjoy all the time spent together. I`m not the one going defensive, all I said was that I think cutting your hair is not improving yourself and it will stay that way lmao

This. Shure 215s are a great way to get started and if they really want to spend more they can upgrade one day but they won't need to upgrade. They will have paid for themselves long before then and will make a great backup pair if the musicians decide to go with something custom.
This is true. Watch out with schlonged ea doesn't like it. Tried to put it in a team name on an alt during the xmas rewards and it was a big no go with ea lol.
We don't need Chad to bring anything up. he's a terrible caller only looking to leech off the show for his own podcast. He had 7 people listening the other day.
To mirror OP's question, if we have a potentially unlimited source of renewable energy, why would we need to gauge our power usage or worry about producing more or less power based on peak usages? Assuming that we can, at all times, generate more than we need, couldn't we just devise a system where the excess power gets grounded out or released safely somehow and allowed to be metaphorically "drained" from the grid? That would allow us to eschew the traditional grid structure entirely.   Let's just assume I'm not dumb and that I know that this would be a monumental undertaking, requiring a difficult and likely long transition from the current infrastructure to the new.   What are some technical hurdles we'd have to overcome, and would it even be possible with current technology?

For me it's a number of things.  1.) I feel like there isn't enough diversity in equipment type by which I mean no missiles (ATGM, SAM, MANPADS, AA, AGM, AS, etc.), no helicopters (attack, recon, or transport), no IFVs, very few amphibious vehicles, probably some other stuff.  2.) There is no new equipment that I can think of that I find exciting  3.) Mechanics like SEAD are gone and SEAD was a very interesting mechanic that I had never seen in a game before  4.) All 4 of my favorite franchises have now moved away from some elements that I really enjoyed about them. ArmA away from Cold War / Modern era weaponry, Zelda away from movement controls, Halo away from being a good game, and now Wargame, which I only started playing when ArmA ditched the Cold War setting.  I'm not saying a World War II game is going to be bad or anything but I don't like the direction that they're going... which is literally backwards. I can't imagine liking the game any better than I did the Close Combat series and to be honest I'm not sure they can top it.

i remember working at Target and a woman asked me something about makeup... i replied that i didn't know because i've never worn makeup and the bitch goes "well you should it might help"   i'm not one for physical violence but damn i wanted to punch her lol people are nasty!

So, first off you order food and beer to your seat, both of which are very good. The waiters/resses are basically impossible to notice because of the stadium seating and them ducking their heads, but if you need anything, you just write it on a piece of paper and put it on a stand in front of your seat and they take it and bring you what you want.  It's also owned and managed by movie lovers, so they tend not to show shitty movies (at least at the one I've been to) and they also create their own pre-trailer collages of tangentially related art/ads/videos that are quirky and hilarious and awesome. Also, it's not just the late breaking movies; they'll replay classics or cult films or movies that are somehow related to current events or Halloween classics at Halloween, etc. They had Nosferatu with a live band playing the score last Halloween down here in Austin, for example.  Also, being owned by movie lovers, they give explicit instructions at the beginning of the movie to shut the fuck up during the movie, and everyone is informed that if people aren't following the instructions that you should rat them out on those little pieces of paper and they will be removed.  All in all, it's just a really terrific viewing experience. My favorite theater chain ever, and it's not even close.
One heart is good, but this guy had two. Surely you want an abyssal blade instead of a second heart. 
How does the Microserver go with FreeNAS? I was under the impression (never used FreeNAS before) that FreeNAS doesn't like RAID cards, and needs direct access to the disks.  I've read guides where people force cards into an IT mode to remove the RAID functionality and give FreeNAS direct access to the disks. Can this be done with the HP controller in the Microserver, or is it not necessary?
IDK if that's supposed to be an insult, it's not like I would refuse.

Same. Also the skill level in BO3 is way too low imo. Played 1 match a few days ago for the first time in like 9 months on BO3 and went 49-6. Not the best score but it's decent. After not having played fut for 2 weeks I got smashed in friendlies yesterday on fifa 17. Shows how different the skill level is in both games.

Nothing is wrong with the desire to defend yourself. But statistically you're more likely to lose a family member to gun suicide or accidental discharge than you are to a home invasion. It's worth considering.
Last stand has been awesome so far! In the matched I've played most people used cover and I have yet to have a laggy match. The balancing and normalization work wonders and make it feel so much more competitive. And I have seen a lot of really cool tactics and builds that would have never been practicable or viable before.  Last stand is a blast! Great work massive!
&gt;I never said it was black and white  Never said you did.  &gt;should he be asked to leave? Well it would really depend on exactly how he was acting and how uncomfortable it made them.  This is separate from the trans issue since it deal more with a single's person behavious while the trans issue has more to do with gender and sex.  &gt;Are they uncomfortable enough to respond at all, talk to the management, call the police? So whether he is allowed to stay in that restroom or not is a function of a complex social interaction with any member having the right to speak up or veto (call the police) if the situation is dire enough. In fact this situation is essentially unchanged if you replace the subject with a trans person. If they pass successfully then no one is uncomfortable.  How many people pass successfully and what about the ones who don't? If you call the cops and manager what are they suppose to do? Are they going to be called everytime someone who identifies as a female but is still a man in every possible way from hormone balance to genitalia.  We both agree that it's a messy issue but it's something unique to the transgender community as a whole and trying to force cultural change by having society accept this with laws isn't going to work. Especially when eventually a mtf gets attacked by a violent boyfriend or father for thinking they are creeping on their girls.

It is crazy how some people get so obsessed with their wedding day that they forget that the people they're shitting on will be their family for the rest of their life. It isn't like you're being a monster to the florist you'll never see or interact with again (which is bad enough), you're being an insufferable monster to a life-long family member over the most minuscule details of a few-hours-long party....(I don't condone being shitty to wedding vendors, either, but it is definitely less "shooting yourself in the foot" than crapping all over your family...If you're shitty to your vendors, you're a total jerk, if you're shitty to your family, you're a jerk and an idiot.)

Yeah i get that its a common belief. In full context though, they were trying to catch him breaking roman law of not killing. He was quick on his feet to not disobey scripture and the law of the land. They also tried to catch him on blasphemy before his time when he stated he was god, and they were ready to get him, but he said "doesn't it say ye are like god in your law?" referring to psalms. He got away before they knew what happened. Sodomy/homosexuality is not a sin that is common to man. The bible is clear about it being an abomination as well as crossdressing. No where in scripture do sodomites get a pass. Unless its just avoiding them. Judgement has a place in christianity. Sadly everyone is too scared to, or believes like you. No one is free of sin, but there is room to pass judgement, and rebuke the wicked and the abominable. Again sadly the laws of the land are very unbiblical .
Wieners should go under both pros and cons.

AJ is satirical a lot of the time, and he makes a lot of claims based on his own intuition.

i think you're the one who don't know what it means.   There's a slow cleave and fast cleave. if you're talking about a slow cleave, you don't even need to bring a stripper, you basically let the other team moves and then you move. you can even bring will shield everybody - galleon nuker nuker nuker.  Now he's talking about a fast cleave - stripper galleon nuke nuke. That way you kinda need a fast team to take down enemy stripper (eg. Chiwu, Juno etc.)

My Rosewill Reds recently died on me. I used to play &lt;way too much&gt; Starcraft but I'm not that serious about it any more.   How do you think black switches will feel compared to Reds for me? I've been curious about them for forever. I have my Das Blue to my little brother and am currently using a brown WASD just to give a background for my experience. 
You might also like Tolarian Community college. His channel is based around... well pretty much everything except actually playing magic. Consumer reviews on stuff like sleeves, deck boxes, and binders, analysis of products wotc sells (ie. intro decks) including financial value of singles and player value in the context of different types of magic players (competive, casual, new, etc.). A lot of people like him.
Well, yeah.   That doesn't mean that we can't try to get him the fuck out by any means neccisary. He's already proved to be bad at it, why should we bother to let him do more damage?

What is the "right way" morally is subjective. If you want to be a good person the right way would be the one that affects people badly minimally, if you want to be a successful regardless of how anyone else feels then the "right way" is what gets the results you desire.  For example, is it necessarily "right?" That lots of clothing is made in sweatshops? To some people no because it takes advantage of people, but to some people yes because thats how you make the product for cheap and make the most profit from sales.

I want to love this but I don't understand what the graph is.
Because women and their white knights can't approach discussing the shared behaviors of women in a critical manner without Reeeeing. They just can't. Here's a good example of what I mean.  If I were to say "Men's obsession with sports is asinine". I would meet effectively zero negative response and no personal attacks for it. Nobody would say "But that's a geeeeeeenraaaaaalizaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy shuuuuuunnnnnn". Nobody would say "You can'tz says dats abouts mens! Go back to twox!!!!".   I'd get "Yeah, but dude, how about that Jeter? I'd suck Youkilliss' dick!" or "Meh. I don't care about sports, but it does bore me when I'm hanging out with other dudes and all they can talk about is sportsball". That's what I'd get.  But there's an interrupt when it comes to discussing behavioral trends or *anything* negative when it comes to women. Were I to say "Women rely too much on emotional manipulation over logic and reason", watch the results. "Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat's muh general-eye-zaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyshunnnnn!!!!" (as if describing a statement discounts it), and "OMG!!!! YOU AMZ DA MISOGYNIST!!!!" and "What? You never metz da wimminz B4!?!?!?!??.  It's fucking ridiculous. It's also based on lies, pride, and, ironically, emotional manipulation.   The fact of the matter is, people behave in groups. Few people skew far from the groups they belong to. White people tend to act like other white people. Men tend to act like other men. That doesn't mean that there won't be differential, but if group behavior by demographic wasn't observable and definable, then the multibillion dollar industry of marketing wouldn't make a penny. Fifth ave would be a fucking ghost town. And there would be no fucking Facebook.   That doesn't mean that all shared characteristics of group members are bad. But nor does it mean that they are positive. But for some reason, discussing the negative characteristics of a protected group (pretty much any but straight white males) is a mortal sin.  Why? Power. It's simple. It's power. When you name the negative behavior and describe it as negative, it is up to each individual member of the group to confront that behavior within themselves and decide whether or not they wish to modify it. If you can characterize women as having some number of shared negative behaviors, you can then characterize them as just as flawed as men. That makes it harder for them to wear that bullshit "womynz be pure" that they swing around at their convenience. That *humanizes* them and showed them as inherantly as fallible. Just like men.  And we all know that white knights will say and do anything that they think will get them a whiff of pussy.   So, why is it so hard to talk about "issues women face in gaming"? Because very few people are able to have that conversation honestly.   If you want to know who is in power, just observe whom you cannot criticize.

Kirk Cousins is primed to be the top-paid QB in the league. Is he really worth that kind of money? We're not talking a "little more". Again, it may be worth it if he is truly high caliber, but we haven't seen him thrive in a situation that he will likely be in when he comes here. 2017 will be a prime season to see what he does without (possibly) Jackson and (possibly) Garcon.

Make them adjust, take what they give you. If they're sending only 3 men run to the weak side all day. If they crossman the weakside, you can roll out to the weakside and playmaker people if there's nothing there. You can use concepts such as a slot out + an outside streak on the short side and hit the streak for ~20 yards against soft squat, the tell is if they don't press. You can hit the middle pretty well if they send 5-6 man, just beware of the user. You can hit them deep using stuff like Bunch verticals, or anything with a really deep corner, like Curl Flat Corner, with a route underneath and a streak clearing out. Screens usually work pretty well. Don't give up on the run game just because they shoot the gap once. Deep post routes will typically get open with an inside+underneath pass lead, if you can pick up the pressure. You can usually pick it up with a running back block and release route on the side of the Blitz, or defer to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTqeIiQA3CE). Running Back swing routes + a corner route work better after the patch than regular Corner Strike.   Hope that helped.

You see that's the thing. You weren't facing 100% DRulers. You were also facing Spellbooks. The card is awful in the Spellbooks matchup ad you want to be winning as fast as possible in the match preventing the opponent from locking you down. Ravine is just so much better.  In the DRuler matchup you don't want to be over extending on the field which is exactly what Garden does in that matchup.   It's at the end of the day a win more card and DRulers were so consistent that they didn't even need something that could lead to worse hands.

I agreed with the tag last year, b/c it was only one year of work, so teams had film on him. **But**, that was the gamble, now they have to pay him. 
I read a ton of car reviews. Still won't buy one without rest driving it myself first.   What a review can't tell me is a) how well I fit in the car/my own personal ergonomics, and b) how much I like the way it drives. Only a test drive can tell me those things.

Just to support the previous responses from Wikipedia: Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO, 한국조폐공사) is a government-owned corporation which is responsible to print and mint the banknotes and coins and other government documents. Its headquarters are located in Daejeon, South Korea. KOMSCO also mints coins for other currencies. Products.  The main job of KOMSCO is printing and minting the South Korean currency. Currently the 1000, 5000, 10,000, 50,000 KRW banknotes and the 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 KRW coins are minted and printed by the currency plant of KOMSCO. Also, they produce all South Korean cheques, stamps, and passports.

I can attest to the opinion that the 12BH7 sounds better than the 12AU7 when the bias is adjusted appropriately. In my [Bottlehead Crack](http://bottlehead.com/product/crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit/) I made a [PCB](http://i.imgur.com/R31SnPZl.jpg) with a 3 position switch to change the bias resistors to accommodate the stock 12AU7, 12BH7, and E80CC. In my opinion compared to the 12AU7, the 12BH7 just sounds more smooth, more coherent, and more musical.   I don't claim to understand when to use which tube when the pin-outs are the same: 12AU7 vs 12BH7 vs E80CC. At the end of the day in my Crack headphone amp, I settled on the 5687 as the best sounding input tube, but that required yet [another board](http://i.imgur.com/B8I3Jywl.jpg) to switch the pin-out.

Flew YVR-JFK J on CX 888. Awesome experience. Booked with AA miles for 37.5k.   The lounge in VYR is great, with really good food and friendly staff.   I've flown their A330 J, but the 77W mini cabin is awesome. I was in 11A.   My only complaint was the short flight. It's generally less than 5 hours, so I skipped the meal and just slept. 
damn that's a lot of miles lol  i cant remember a time since moving on from being a helper that i drove a work vehicle with more than 80k miles on it 
Depends on the city, I know some in Berkeley CA that make 15
Everything else on the controller feels pretty solid, it is great for playing NES/SNES on. The sticks do work well but I use one of my PSX or PS4 controllers if I am playing anything that needs sticks.

No proof here, but a good theory. 
Yes. It's geometric sequence.    a1 = 1.082, q = 1.082 =&gt; a150/a130 = q^20  But! To buy lvl 150, you must previously buy lvl 149 and lvl 148 and ... lvl 131, therefore you must spend `C = a131 + a132 + ... a150` money to buy 150 lvl.  ~~And `C/a130 = 1.082^(130) * (1.082^(20) - 1) / 0.082`~~  ~~To buy lvl 150 you need multiply = `C/a130`~~

&gt;only you know you're family and how they think.  Funny enough...I play games and talk on mic (skype) with my brother and cousin (like 2 close friends) and only this past weekend I flat out asked about random (including trans bathrooms) political stances. We all grew up together and talk weekly but none of us really knew anything about what the others thought.  Same for everyone in my family except my mother who is vocal about her opinions and we argue (well...debate) a lot.

Hunter the Reckoning is my favorite, I use the flavour from the original with the updated rules. It is the perfect system for a GM to introduce the WOD to a group of beginners and really hammer home the mystery and danger of the setting while keeping it grounded. I love the feeling of Joe Average vs. The wolfman where every fight is a desperate struggle for survival. The players always end up figuring out a set of very nasty tricks out of necessity and I always enjoy that transformation from normal everyday people to some of the dirtiest fighters the World of Darkness can produce. Nothing is as satisfying as have the players take down an objectivly more powerful Vampire with piano wire, roofing nails and a supersoaker full of gasoline.
Only the Republican parts. That isn't even hyperbole, Trump himself says he only represents Republicans and his supporters. He's started saying that we're going to be a one-party country. This is on track for a civil war.

I work for a Party City, what mostly happens is people tend to get in line in large groups even tho one person is actually buying something. The people in front of you were most likely groups and all went to check out and leave in "herds". We hate customers like that cuz it makes the lines look unnecessarily long and when we get random corporate visitors it doesn't look good on us cuz it makes us look slow. Also pro-tip, ALWAYS do your Halloween shopping in advance with us because we WILL sell out of almost everything and the closer to the holiday, the worse the stock/lines will get. Beat the rush.

I really disagree that it gave us nothing. Obviously Jakku is going to be important. They wouldn't make a big deal about Rey being there otherwise. And just because we know there was a battle doesn't mean we don't deserve to see it... It's like saying they shouldn't have made Rogue One.

Your logic is a bit flawed for the "everything has to be literal or consistent" fallacy. This probably why The Bible did not explain everything. Too many readers with out higher logic skills.  
Uber's interview process is fucking TRASH. I interviewed there before all the recent controversies. Horribly unprofessional recruiters who will forget about you and then come back bleating after you've already accepted a position elsewhere. My favorite part, though, was being invited on-site and then getting an e-mail out of the blue the day before stating that the team "had gone in a different direction." In retrospect, I'm glad I never got an offer there.  Fuck Uber, fuck their recruitment process and fuck their reactionary culture of only doing the right thing when doing the wrong thing bites them in the ass. I use Lyft whenever possible now and only keep the Uber app on my phone for true emergencies.

Money isn't everything if you already have enough.  Security matters a lot.  I'd be a lot more concerned about money if I didn't have security.  If I were making a third of what I'm making now, I'd trade my fun job for one that pays more.  Now?  Not so much.  Edit: Lifestyle matters, too.  I get more than enough money to live comfortably, and I do so with very little stress.  To me, that's better than making a bit more (even a lot more) but having a ton of stress.  Now, with a *lot* more money, I might be tempted.

Not disagreeing with you at all. I think Pierce would have had more playoff success before KG and Allen had the GM tried to build on the 2002 team. Instead Ainge made smart moves to sacrifice success in the short term for a contender long term. That's the reason Pierce didn't get the opportunity to make deep playoff runs early. Well that and Detroit/Cleveland.   I still hate him though.

Oh trust me those jagoff republicans deserve to die just as much as the democrats. Having said that there's really no pointing the fingers and the other isle when the democrats should be blaming themselves. The dem establishment waged EVERYTHING on Hilldawg all while knowing how fucked candidate she was. That didn't stop them for forcing her down the ballot. And look what happened.. The dems lost EVERYTHING for Hillary.. At OUR expense.. Now we have a republican controlled congress and a douche president....!THANKS HILLARY! THANKS OBAMA!!

I'm honestly fine with that. I'd be so down for Asuka vs Charlotte and Asuka vs Sasha.
Where? I googled it and searched in this subreddit to make sure it wasn't found.
Seems the bot died somewhere between the 2 hour mark and the 1.5 hour mark. I just kicked it in the shins.. lets see if that gets the gloves droppin

so if i use the bible as my recipie book to cook food religiously does that make me a christian? can anyone just call themself a christian and then go do something in the name of god and have that associated with the catholics and the baptists? i love the way you said that because the wahabis throw away 95% of the koran right out the fucking window and just go to the killing part. this is why they have nothing in common with other muslims. theyre like trolls. if i put on a cop uniform it doesnt make me a cop. i would have to have training and there has to be some authority. in the middle east the situation is extremely complicated. the saud family just used their authority to rape everybody with salafist takfiri wahabism which is why the problem is so huge. everyone thinks theyre legit and they are not. 
I thought lane splitting was only legal in stationary traffic?  In saying that, red car is a massive dick.
You get it from both sides as libertarian, but only if you're in an environment where you interact heavily with people on both sides. This is not the case at university, where left wing politics reign supreme.

I actually think Julianne Alexander does a great job at making Felicia sound like an actual person in Fates and Heroes. As opposed to her JP voice that was... Not really all that distinctive of a voice, IMHO. 
Quick question, how many came from those countries since 9/11? 
This is self-defense. When the group you're fighting is advocating for a genocide, and has already committed one, they lose their protected status. Nice try though

Oh....
It's not like the gameworks package has some code the reads something like "If GPU != NVidia then FPS = x/2". Nvidia built a software package designed to showcase DirectX11 and tessellation at it's best.  It just so happens that AMD is weak at tessellation. No one's crying foul when a DirectX 12 showcase title runs poorly on Nvidia. 
Tell me about it
I believe those are our odds of making the playoffs currently. I could be wrong though since I haven't checked the website in a while.

With their D-Pad you could only press one or two buttons simultaneously, since they are all attached to each other. By making the D-Pad out of buttons like the ABYX buttons they bypass this issue, however this has the unfortunate side effect of not allowing them to put their nice D-pad on the controller.  It isn't some Nintendo conspiracy to sell pro controllers that have the D-Pad, they are simply able to put the D-pad on the Pro controller because it isn't meant to be split like the Joycons.
I just can't allow myself to trust a kid that has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the ability to score outside of the paint. We have seen what that offense looks like over the years with Tyreke and Rondo, and I'm not interested in trying that experiment all over again.  I agree that Wall is a fantastic talent. That's why I think he's an unfair comparison for Fox. Guys like John Wall are the exception. There are way more Mudiay's and Elfrid Payton's than John Wall's.  Mudiay was touted as being one of the best, if not THE best athlete in his draft class. He got injured in high school, and was also injured while playing in China. He may not have been the distributor that Fox is, but I also guarantee Mudiay didn't play with anybody like Malik Monk or Bam Adebayo while he was playing in China either...
its a distraction from the possibility of a class war which might be more productive.

I got a really nice couch from Ikea that folds out into a bed and it also has storage in it. My guests use it when they visit and normally put a futon on top. Super comfy! 
Hiding in the locker  Playing on Xbone with Kinect  Drunk so give Alien the finger as it's leaving the room  It stops, approaches the locker, sniffs and then tears me out  The Alien doesn't take kindly to the finger and it *knows*

I'm overdue for a trip up there. What soft serve flavors did they have?
Still have the white OG to worship at least. 
I think that's what he believes? It's the same old shit Fragile Donny always does. He can't fathom the concept of taking responsibility for anything that isn't success so he lies and deflects his ineptitude to those around him.   White House staff aren't political wild dogs, they're professionals with actual careers that they're putting at risk because they hate this dick. It's not like they call Barry O on Saturdays and ask for marching orders. 
Is there any other type of Lib Dem campaign?

Let's just hope that Skinner didn't drink the milk of Supercow this morning
She actually almost never draws herself nude, ironically.
I do hope that they do go back to travelling in-between dimensions for the semi-filler episodes, though. I wanna explore more of the universe Star lives in; Earth has gotten stale with how much focus has been on it 😜  There could easily be several sub-plots with that-- like for instance they visit some other dimension and they run into trouble, like Interdimensional Field Trip or Pixtopia in season 1.
In this situation, you're getting kicked before the dungeon is completed, so there's no reason you would be mailed the rewards.  You might be able to get loot faster by getting the Advanced Logistics mastery with Heart of Thorns.  Kicking a player as the final boss dies is generally bannable. Though people don't kick people in "dungeons" nearly as often. Fractals, on the other hand, you might be doing something wrong if you get kicked.

&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/5vitfj/anakin_after_rotj  And? The only reply I see to my post is [this right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/5vitfj/anakin_after_rotj/de5s0g9/). Did you type up another reply but forget to hit send? Because I'm not seeing another one.  &gt;When someone is saying whether something exists or not that used to exist and when the idea of the Force and new religions around the Force are constantly being introduced into the lore, tense has everything to do with it.  It doesn't. Pablo was simply talking and pointing out the flaws of the name "Gray Jedi". It doesn't matter what tense he was speaking in.  &gt;Nightwing wasn't a crooked cop. He was fighting against crooked cops. Yes, it's a different thing, but the larger meaning of that discussion had validity.  Forgive me, I don't really read too many comics so I was simply going off of what was said in the tweets.  &gt;Jedi have much further reaching powers than Texas Rangers and are also a religious sect.  What further powers do they have that Texas Rangers do not? And being a religious sect doesn't really change much in terms of this discussion.   &gt;Fish eaters may be technically called pescetarians, but I know several that don't call themselves that. Many people do. Are they wrong? Sure. It's all about the term. I haven't asked them, but I imagine they'd say that one is a subset of the other (whether wrong or not).  It doesn't matter what they call themselves, they are pescetarians, they're not vegetarians.   &gt;So, again, it all comes down to having a problem with the actual term, which I've admitted may not be the term that would be used (if a term is ever used, which it may not be). I'm not making up my own word for it that then no one will understand what I'm referring to,   It's a problem with the term and with the  &gt;so untill/unless they ever do that, Gray Jedi is the best equivalent.  No, the best equivalent is "force user" or just the character's name.  Like Pablo said, Ahsoka(and others) follow their own path. Call them by their name.   &gt;So, then, I really have no idea why there is an argument about it.  Because there's no such thing as "Gray Jedi". That implies an organization related to the Jedi, which likely comes from the days when everyone that wasn't a Jedi was an "X Jedi". Dark Jedi, Grey Jedi, etc.   People in canon who fit the second definition of Gray Jedi from Legends are not part of an organization. They are their own thing.  &gt;If the idea of it is acceptable, we currently have no better term for it, so we use the closest understood equivalent when talking about a concept, until there is a term in place.   We do have a perfectly good term: Force user. That's what they are. They're not part of a specific organization. They're just their own thing.   Gray Jedi is a false, non-canon term that has negative fanfictiony connotations(a lot of people associate it with the first definition, not the second one.)  You can't just assume Legends stuff is equivalent in canon, that's not how it works.
Ha. I get what you're saying and appreciate the joke.  On the back end though, obscenity has its place with the law, as well as risk (legal, chargeback, etc) and that's where the rules stem from.  They want to please as many legal standards as they can.

&gt; The flat earth argument has many good points  No, it really doesn't. Basic physics wholesale disproves any "point" flat-earthers make.  &gt; The bible says the earth is flat and we believed it for 1000's of years.   Hardly a source you want to use when trying to argue scientific evidence.
Overwatch central made a video about it. Its 18 seconds if I remember correctly. 
Very doubtful, I mean, its not impossible but the games available on PC from 'Xbox Game Pass' will most likely be limited to the 'Play Anywhere' titles. 
I wouldn't say this was a bad experience, but it odd/interesting:  I once noticed out of the corner of my eye there was a man (who looked suspiciously like a ragged Mr. Bean) staring at my face. He looked like he was trying to say something to me. Since it was loud I thought at first I just couldn't hear him. But as he continued to mutter, I realized this man was having an entire imaginary conversation with me. It was an odd feeling to know I was the subject of someone else's imagination, he was so lost in thought he never even seemed to notice me staring back at him.   All I could think was, "I hope I'm at least being interesting."
Well done!

Yeah dude, I'm really praying for OCE since they are unknown. We could really embarrass ourselves to be honest :/. I think if the top teams take it really seriously they may be able to compete with some of the NA teams but I think EU may be too much for us.
This. I cook because I like good food. I exercise because it it improves cognitive function and reduces stress. I'm married and I have a four year-old, so I have little time for any other hobbies.  ...okay, so occasionally I host a board game night with my colleagues, but that's so rare that I don't count that as a hobby.

I might be wrong, but I'm not sure that's true. Since Deep-Fiend's trigger is on cast, this portion of the rules is relevant:  &gt;601.2h The player pays the total cost in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t be paid.  &gt;601.2i Once the steps described in 601.2a–h are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as it’s cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell’s controller had priority before casting it, he or she gets priority.  If I'm not mistaken, the sacrificing the creature as part of the cost will happen before the cast trigger is put on the stack, so the replacement effect in Kalitas' ability will happen giving the other player a zombie before that happens.  Then when the trigger is put onto the stack you choose targets, which can include the zombie. Again if you (or someone else) have a better explanation I'd love to hear it- I'm not a judge or anything so I might be totally misunderstanding the rules.
Is this actually gonna happen? Or is it all smoke and mirrors? This would be a gamechanger for this society. If this passes, maybe anti smoking campaigns can rev up and we can get some real anti smoking education happening here. The amount of pregnant women and people holding babies that I see lighting up is so sad.  I would proudly carry a copy of this law with me whenever I go out to eat and shove it in the face of anyone not complying. I'd go full Debito.

&gt;Quantas crianças tu conhece com essa capacidade intelectual? Quantas dessas crianças super inteligentes também tem maturidade o suficiente? Tu tá falando da exceção da exceção da exceção. Absoluta minoria.  É um ponto valido. Mas é questão de liberdade de escolha, claro, se souberem usar esta liberdade. E mesmo que existisse *uma* única criança inteligente o suficiente para pular de série ou aprender sozinha em casa, deveríamos legalizar para favorece-lá.   Eu ouvi dizer que 2% da população tem QI alto, o que não quer dizer coisa alguma per se, mas vamos assumir que esses 2% são gênios.  Vamos lá, no Brasil então, há teoricamente cerca de 4 milhões de gênios, mas como isso engloba todas as idades, vamos *fingir* que há 1 milhão de jovens gênios com capacidade de aprenderem sozinhas. Se 1 milhão for muito, então 100 mil, 10 mil, mil, cem, dez? Qual o motivo de não dar o direito de estudar em casa? 
Only 3 tanks for vanilla naxx, that's cute Edit: Apparently the /s is always necessary 
You are right about that. It destroys every relationship. I've learned that it is something I have to keep for myself if I don't want to lose a person. The bad thing is that you can't have a genuine relationship if you keep big things like that for yourself, so I am alone. I know very well what you mean.

Everyone gets set to the same AP level at the start of 7.2. A pretty good time to reroll 
As far as I know, there is no official release of even the track itself yet. I'm sure someone could make a loop of just the piano part though.

Right?  Unless there is a secret habit of women drying off their bits using the hand dryers ?
This is about as far as I'd go. Flying overseas can be pretty chaotic and even dangerous if she lands in another country for some reason, so it'd be worth the time to see for myself IMO. It would also help influence whether or not I would do it again.  I wouldn't pay for it nor would I chaperone trips to like the DMV and stuff though. 
It's impossible to remain top of your region if you refuse to play meta champs. Pocket picks are fine once in a while but if you are unable to play OP meta champs then you not only play a weaker champ but you give it over to the enemy unless you ban it.  The macro game evolves season after season as well. Changes to the meta will change the team compositions that are played and different team compositions approach the macro game differently, even on the same patch. There isn't a notion of "just learn macro and you'll be fine." Skillls do transfer but you still need to do a lot of work consistently to stay at the top. The game is really complex at the pro level.

I'm sorry that you would let the actions of one individual at the lowest possible rung of the corporate ladder just have you make a knee-jerk reaction like that and swear off the whole brand.  Just seems like a bit much to me.
 Nice, I have a FT with Holo stickers

Definitely. I have to remember that SNSD worked on pretty much just this for months before debut. I guess I kind of felt like this was finally the group to do it "right".   SNSD covers are usually good for showcasing the individuals in a group, and ITNW works well for that. It's always good that groups do these covers, if only for that reason. :D

maybe play on console and hit two buttons within a split second to fast travel... then you would be surprised too that no warning popped up that you could actually see  this could have been implemented so easily... just a press and hold once you carry contaminated items...  derp is maybe a bit too offensive... let alone the derpa

Been meaning to go, but my family is so hectic we always miss the deadline. I try to get them out like 30 minutes earlier so we're on time, and we leave too late. Also we're a family of 4 so the assigned seating actually ends up hindering us a lot of times, maybe next time if a good movie comes out there again we'll get 4 seats in advance online like a few days before.  It does seem like a really nice theatre, just to be honest they're a little disorganized downstairs and could do with a little more customer guidance, you have to go like into the middle, outside the bar area to reach the customer service area and their ticketing computer machines are really uh, not sticky but the word is not that responsive. You kinda have to smash your finger into the touchscreen to get a response sometimes. But those are just little things.
Welcome! Your list of things to accomplish before baby sounds awesome and totally doable! 
come on why are you taunting me there is no way i can decipher that 😢 
I'm sorry.  If it were me I'd probably tell them off...it would make me feel better and shut them up.  ::sigh:: I hope that this goes quickly for you.  Hugs.

Yup. That's what my first appointment is, just meeting with a nurse. I meet with my doctor the very next day though.
I think he doesn't really care about his youtube career all that much. In one of the other threads about this someone mentioned he apparently works as a pizza delivery guy. He's probably hoping to win the case, get a nice pay-out and never care about youtube ever again.
From a certain perspective. If two players have one hundred hours on their account and one person has all one hundred on one hero and the other has 25 hours on four heroes, it is not "fair." That one person is playing for nothing and the other is playing for something. That is just objective fact. I am not arguing it HAS to be fair. That being said, it is not necessarily fair. The point is moot as Epic is doing something regardless of your perceived fairness. I just more or less wanted to point out that you are wrong. Since I am so late, I never got to point out how you were wrong in your first comment... So I have to make due with this.

&gt; Okay, but seriously, the "out-of-ten" scores are almost all done according to American primary school grading rubrics  ...not really. I feel like there's a huge disconnect between what the standard 10 point, near-universal rating system actually represents (which is usually outlined in every publication and reflected in the review) and people with really awkward issues with their grade school years. Maybe its an issue in the gaming world where it seems like a game really has to fuck up to score below an 8/10 -which is more an issue with gaming politics than ratings themselves- but in any other medium (particularly music and movie reviews) an 8/10 is generally seen as very good.  edit: rewording.

"I am a recovering porn addict, and although the thought of a girl letting two guys fuck her at the same time severly disgusts me and i would never participate in this sexual act, it turns me on a lot (but other very disturbing things in porn had the same effect).

Ah you should definitely have made an account. There's no other way to track your order. If you sent the exact amount and have it confirmed on blockchain, no reason you shouldn't have your order in your mailbox within 10 days, he's pretty consistent with his turnaround time. Just had my order from last Wednesday ship.  Edit: Looks like you can't create an account without an order.

Yeah. I've come across several guys who have lost a lot of weight after being overweight most of their lives. They immediately think "where all the honeyz at", &amp; are somewhat taken aback when their dating prospects havent improved significantly at all. Going from ugly to somewhat average makes little difference - you still have your work cut out in a very competitive environment. Guys who have been average or slightly above their whole life, already realize this reality.   &gt; Yes, guys with a wife and family can/do loose total perspective once they've left the dating pool for a while  Reminds me of when somebody ( it might have Rosie O'Donnell) started answering every question with *"well, as a mother"* to mock the way mothers/parents suddenly think their opinion is so much more valid than everyone else's.
"Everyone wanna be like Mike...". Bad analogy.

There's Evasion and Miss Chance.  Evasion stacks by measuring every next evasion item/skill "seperately" after the last one. For simplistic math, lets assume you have a 50% dodge skill and purchased a 50% dodge item.  Firstly it checks to see if your skill "procs", so there's a 50/50 chance to dodge. If it doesn't dodge, it checks to see if your item procs, another 50/50. This ends up being a 75% evasion. There's genuine math behind this, but if you want a rule of thumb to go by, whenever you buy a second/third/whatever source of evasion, it's effectiveness is reduced by the % of your previous item.  Blinds/Missing is different, because it doesn't check if you dodged it, but if the enemy missed. First they check if their attack is either a miss or a hit, *then* check whether or not you have evasion. I believe miss chance stacks in similar fashion, in that it seperately runs the chances per debuff. 
One of my employees is an xbox player with no plans to buy a PS4. He has been following this game forever and is so pissed because he wants to play it so bad. My plan is to email him a redditors super positive review every day to drive him mad. Really though when I finish the game I am going to lend him my system and the game so he can give it a go.
If it lasts any longer I'd say it's the flu. Kratom withdrawals typically max out at 4 days, from what I've gathered. This is assuming you've stopped all usage.   You can also take smaller doses, and eventually your body will adjust to this.
Need more lol
this also made me think back to the beginning of TFA where a hand on finn's helmet kickstarted his journey.  &gt; The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- **his HUMAN HAND visible** -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD just before he dies.  And that strange part in the novelization where Kylo removes her restraints and strokes her face  &gt;“I can take whatever I want,” he said to her.  &gt;“Then you don’t need me to tell you anything.”  &gt;“True,” he said. **His fingers stroked her face.**  &gt;Released from her restraints, she could have pushed him away, which was probably what he wanted. But that would have broken her concentration. And she needed all of it to block him from probing deeper.
LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME. I'M QUITTING GUYS, I'M SO IMPORTANT. LOOK AT ME.
Finally asking the right questions.

Oh for sure. There are definitely serious workplace problems that need to be tackled in a direct manner such as harassment (sexual or otherwise), serial dishonesty, theft, bullying, and so on... but a live and let live philosophy for the small stuff is definitely the best approach for everyone involved.  Do I feel cheated that my coworker can step out of the office for five to ten minutes in order to have a cigarette every couple of hours? Fuck yes I do. Is giving him shit/complaining to the boss about it going to be productive? Nope. It will just breed resentment and make my work life worse
&gt;Can you clarify what you think is wrong with their assertion?  Yes, he said:  &gt; three schisms of the same sect  and:  &gt; how ridiculously open ended all interpretations are.  But the latter is not the reason I downvoted, it's debatable.

For those in the Bay Area, the famous Sunday brunch at Wat Mongkolratanaram Thai Buddhist Temple in Berkeley is worth a trip.  I don't recall if it was purely vegetarian, but I remember a lot of vegetarian options the last time I went.

There are many opinions where it's valid to have a belief that goes against the mainstream. Then there are those where it isn't.   The efficacy of vaccines is one of them. They are demonstrably safer than a society without them. You're having a hard time finding a reasonable discussion *because you're wrong*.   I have no trouble finding someone to discuss how much funding should be allocated to space agencies, whether or not certain celebrities are good looking, or whether or not chemo is a good option for them, because those require context and depend on your belief. Vaccine use simply does not compare. 
Sweet! I'd been wondering when they would release their video footage of Phalleforia. Everything went well from what I'm watching. 
Freak out about the fact that huge amounts of the world's workforce has suddenly vanished, and help work on strategies for getting the economy back on track so we don't starve.  Also probably lots of sex.

Different people respond differently to different leaders and different leadership style. I agree that for casual players, yes getting flamed can tilt you.  And that's the point. That needs to change. Part of what distinguishes a good player is the fact they can deal with it. DotA is an environment where negative communication has been a norm for many many years.   Confrontational leadership DOES in fact work extremely well especially in competitive environments. In DotA, being a good player means being grown up enough not to get offended for being called out. If you can't respond to criticism that isn't candy coated, DotA is not the game for you.  Look at RTZ, EE, Korok, Dendi, Fear, ppd, Sumail, Mason, Bulba, Moonmeander, Misery... All of them flame gratuitously in pubs. Very few of them have been called bad teammates by other people that they have played with. Hell, look at Puppey. Even with monitor smash rage, those who played with him still say he was an excellent Captain.  Guess who HAS been called a bad teammate? Reddit's favorite well-mannered players, Aui and Kuroky.  This isn't unique to eSports either. There are plenty of successful companies, businesses, sports teams, etc. in the "real world" with leaders who are notorious for creating combative environments.  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates both were notorious for being confrontational, demanding, and "hard to work for/with." And it's that pressure that kept their companies on top. Gordon Ramsay is lauded as one of the best chefs in the world, and he's almost as famous for his mouth as his food.  Bezos from Amazon believes that office "harmony" is overrated and he encourages employees to disagree. He believes that employees shouldn't be afraid of conflict and that feedback in the company can be "blunt to the point of painful." And it's an idea that more companies are finding helpful with how brainwashed people have become to "get along" and work together. https://hbr.org/product/wiser-getting-beyond-groupthink-to-make-groups-smarter/2299E-KND-ENG  Look at Michael Jordan, still hailed as the best basketball player ever. After his Hall of Fame induction speech Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports described him as “a bully tripping nerds with lunch trays in the school cafeteria.” The spectacle even featured Jordan inviting his high school coach Pop Herring and former teammate Leroy Smith just so that Jordan could turn to Herring and say “I wanted to make sure you understood: You made a mistake, dude” in reference to Herring choosing Smith for the varsity team over Jordan during his sophomore year. Hell Jordan caused one of his teammates to retire because he verbally abused him so badly during practice. A teammate said this about him in Sports Illustrated: "He’s the most viciously competitive player I’ve ever seen. That’s what makes him, I think, the greatest player ever. He has practically ruined Rodney McCray for us." When Jordan and McCray were on opposite teams in scrimmages, Jordan would be "in Rodney’s face, screaming, ‘You’re a loser! You’ve always been a loser!’" As a result, "Rodney can hardly put up a jumper now." The Bulls won the title that year but McCray only averaged 15.9 minutes per game and retired right after.
I plan to. Gonna try and be there as early as possible depending on work. 
Another post about how they ignore ptr balance. You realize we're not their balance team, right? PTR is a testing region for testing bugs, glitches, new mechanics. They already put time and thought into balancing, changing, reworking characters. They don't need a lot of half assed posts about how something is OP to tell them that(although there was a lot of work put into some posts, most of em there's none). It's the public *test* region, not the public **balance** region. 
I absolutely accept that

I'm not related to Mormon(ism?) or anything, but people who only like others based off religion or politics are just sad and know that they're probably wrong. Sorry to hear it bud.
Guess we better not mention the Hema  O.o  This game is about the grind. It's really a 3rd person dungeon crawler with simplified mechanics and more emphasis on pew pew. The core game is about working towards gathering goals so that you can obtain frames and weapons. If those goals were easy what would be the point in playing?   If your goals are too hard to achieve right now change them to long term goals. If you're only able to gather 100 Oxium per mission and the grind is killing you Vauban needs to go on the back burner. When you get a Nekros or find a good group to farm with pick it back up. Also look out for those double drop weekends! You'll see fairly frequently new players asking what to spend their plat on. The answer is always the same. Slots. Don't buy frames. If you do you have nothing to work towards and that's the fun of this game. 
So many people seem to discount morality when it comes to discussing theology and the actions of God...  More people should be willing to wrestle with the teachings of their church.   it's a shame that this tenant of Judaism has largely been done away with in most modern Christian denominations. I mean, even Abraham argued with God when it came to the destruction of the city of Sodom.

We're currently focusing on fixing all of the reported server/save issues - should be ready this week and we will roll out an update.
&gt; This post is more so questioning why we view these things as inherently wrong or evil when they clearly are effective when done correctly. But yeah, carry on folks.  Seriously?  You wonder why we view lying as inherently wrong?  Did you ever lie or cheat a friend and have them find out?  How did that work out for you?  Enlarge this to society as a whole.  The only reason lying and cheating are sometimes successful is we can't police everything.  Law enforcement is a deterrent.  Some are caught, some aren't.  You're taking a risk if you bet your life on lying and cheating.  I'm willing to bet there are far more successful people who don't spend their lives lying and cheating than those who do.
I have a card dilemma. I have 38% attack, 30% CD with just 9%attack speed and 9% ignore defense. I just rolled a 6* punisher card with 10% ignore defense and attack speed and 5.4% CD but no all attack. The Zombies card I would replace has 9% CD so my CD would go down to 24.6 or 38 with Alliance boost. My All attack would reduce to 32 but my attack speed and Dpen would raise to 19% each. Do you think this would be advisable move or keep my CD and attack? 
Looks epic OP! If the screenshots are anything to go by, this game should be a gorgeous experience at a low cost. Really curious about gameplay. 
Do you remember when having Mahomes at 32 was blasphemy on this sub?
Hard to come by well crap I found a JVC which had 700 lines component and was curved and passed on it didn't think it would be very good
I finished rewatching the Wisconsin game, first notable play is hooker loses track of the tight end in coverage when he thinks the QB is going to run and allows a completion. The next notable play is a positive as hooker flys in absolutely levels a wr on an end around. Hooker again flys in and blows up a screen play. Late in the game hooker misses a tackle on a run. Hooker flys in and makes a tackle with under 2 mins left.  So he did miss a tackle this game, but he made many more plays with his instincts, speed, and tackling than the one missed tackle. I'm going to rewatch the Michigan game next. 
That is truly some epic level trolling by The Farage. 
Not usually, it doesn't.  Not a single Outback in a 50 mile radius of my house has above 3 stars.  Most sit in the 2.5-3 range.  Do a google search and you'll probably see a range of 2.5 to 3.5, depending on where the Outbacks are and how many reviews they've got.  Yelp doesn't work well in small towns.  Yelp works great in big cities.

Really informative recipe.
Assuming the message doesn't have to be on paper, cram the bottle full of as many micro SD cards as will fit. Latency is going to be terrible, it may take days, months, or even years to get to it's destination, but that's going to be a pretty respectable amount of data, all the same.   As the saying goes in relation to throughput vs latency, "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of backup tapes hurtling down the highway"

I missed the last earnings pop in November but wasn't too confident that this would play out again. Bought 3 Mar 03 2017 12.50 Calls @ $0.85 yesterday, sold 2 today @$1.95. Holding 1 still and will probably sell at open or a few min later. Playing a few earnings this week and wish I loaded up on this instead. 
UPDATE: A few minutes ago, I got it in the saved gift card section.

By all means, collect the funds to pay for one or compel the city to complete their own study.  All I'm saying is that the details are there to discredit if someone wants to.
Thank you for your honest feedback. I really have looked back and agree with most of your critique.   My workflow when putting this together was basically just building a selects reel sequence and then pulling my favorite shots from those selects onto my main timeline.   It is for that reason that I think I am lacking a beginning middle and end.   I cringe at the thought of storyboarding a montage video for some reason. I always say that I will do it, but once I have my footage, I usually just get to work and see what happens.   As for the song, it is all the same song. In fact, I didn't touch it much at all. Simply layered cheering SFX over it and obviously added some raw internal audio that I thought sounded kind of cool even though the quality was poor - thought it gave kind of a live in concert sort of feel.   Landings - I added a few landings at the very end. But I know what you mean - I wish I would have spent some more time trying to add a few tricks that were more "in full." It was tough to cut to the music and also have a full trick with landing.   Podium - Easy answer: they didn't give me access onto the snow so I didn't have any good footage of it. One of my main critiques that I have of myself is that once a project starts to look cool, I become anxious to finish it. It's literally a burning sensation that keeps me up at night. Then once it's posted, I spend the next month looking at all the things that I could have spent more time on and perfected.

It's fine. Did you get the giraffes on Imgur? If it wasn't scheduled downtime, or an actual complete failure of the site, usually refreshing a few times works.  The thing with stuff like tinypic and photobucket is that it's nigh-on impossible to direct link to the image, so you have to deal with their shitty sites, and they compress the fuck out of pictures too.  Imgur still compresses images somewhat, but I believe it's only above a certain filesize.
Thought I remembered something like that. I think hers was "watered down" from memory which is why she isn't like 2 feet taller, I think that's also why the side effects were lessened but I could be wrong.
I 'debug' things with the debug menu. :|  Anything else is cheesing.
To answer that, honestly I haven't really thought about it. My general train of thought is that at a certain point he isn't going to be able to blame anyone for that period. You cannot spend 4 years blaming it on others and that stuff runs thin very quickly. That's why I said It's something to monitor overall. If it and other things in the next some odd years don't sit well I'll make a decision at the voting booth.

You guys use Propylene Glycol right? PG is generally safe, but some rare people don't react well to it though, although PG's liver toxicity is negligible in almost everyone (even in relatively high quantities consumed) it may be enough to bother him. This will be especially likely if he has a fatty liver or is using anything else that is liver toxic (Alcohol, Tylenol/Acetominophen, oral AAS, PHs, etc.). Maybe it's that, if thats the case he should just stick to using the powder, or possibly find another solvent.

Damn. I just thought he was feeling swift out and Megan set him up to test him
&gt;Okay, but the majority of the wealth created for the wealthiest individuals in the world has been from rent seeking activities.  Absolutely. Capital investment and rentseeking are two different things, though.  &gt;Technological innovation, and changes in labor participation and multitudinous other factors (such as the business cycle) create rentseeking opportunities.  How do you figure that?  Moreover, I'd point out that part of the idea of UBI is to diminish the severity of boom-and-bust cycles.  &gt;This also presumes that the current, the ones I talked about in the last paragraph, rent-seekers (especially the ones with a lot of money = power) aren't going to resist anti-rentseeking legislation  Of course they are. But like I say, that's just something we have to overcome. Throwing up our hands and saying 'the system is too corrupt, there's no way to ever un-corrupt it' is not a way of making any progress.  &gt;Farmland isn't capital?  Certainly not all of it. How much (if any) depends on what you mean by 'farmland'. If you've tilled the soil and planted seeds, the field as a whole is *partly* capital in that it has been transformed by artificial effort into a non-natural state (being tilled and having seeds in it). On the other hand, if you merely *intend* to farm a region of pristine wilderness, and have not yet tilled it, planted it, or otherwise transformed it into a non-natural state, it is not capital at all, in any part, because it has not been produced by any artificial effort.  &gt;You are just going to ignore Enclosure acts?  I don't think they're relevant here. I'm talking about capital in the economic sense, not the accounting sense. Economically speaking, anything that is not produced by artificial effort is *not* classified as capital. It makes no difference whether somebody happens to hold a document giving them an exclusive legal title to it and could theoretically exchange that title for other things.  &gt;Economics is a social science, and studying how economies work doesn't cause that economy to constrain markets.  I mean 'economics' in the sense of how economies *actually work,* not the corresponding academic field. Consider how in an analogous sense we talk about 'physics' as something out there in the world, governing how objects behave, and not merely in Physics 101 textbooks.  &gt;there are non-market economic models that have not been tried that don't have these rent-seeking opportunities -- a gift economy is one example that comes to mind.  A gift economy seems like a terrible idea and I hope that's obvious enough that I don't have to go into detail explaining why...  &gt;You should be concerned about this because capitalism creates social stratification  It doesn't need to- certainly not to the colossal extent seen in the contemporary world. That depends on factors beyond merely capitalism being implemented in the economy.  &gt;what arguments do you have that capitalism is the BEST system, better than any other, and has less negative consequences than other systems?  That depends how you define 'best'.  The short version is: Capitalism is necessary in order to respect individual freedom. The reason this is so is that capital is something exclusively produced by artificial effort (it is a *produced good* just as consumable end-user goods are) and thus rightfully belongs to whoever's artificial effort goes into producing it, just like consumable goods. Moreover, respecting individual freedom tends by-and-large to lead to the well-being of people in general, because people tend by-and-large to pursue on an individual basis what is beneficial for themselves when they have the freedom to do so.  &gt;What conditions and features must an economy have for you to consider it capitalism?  Capitalism is the economic condition where capital, for the most part, is privately held and invested for privately collected returns.

You mean they don't acknowledge these things in this particular piece, or in general?

The only people surprised by this are people who have never actually seen a Subway "chicken" patty (or perhaps people who have never actually seen real chicken meat).   I mean, just [look](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4lQcYuTaCEY/T_yhEpnB-mI/AAAAAAAAAKk/5gejrkkmFJI/s1600/b0ca5933-36e8-4d22-aa56-6a45512d6598.jpg) at it! Its not chicken; its a floppy white mush cake with "grill" marks blatantly printed on the side! We've all just collectively agreed to pretend like its chicken for the sake of saving a couple dollars on a quick lunch. 
Just a note, that spreadsheet is using the very, very old SS formula and isn't exact for all SS values. Neither are the DoT multipler or the CRT thresholds. It's unknown if CRT is tiered and to what regard, and SS's effect on DoTs still a mystery. I have a slight model for it, but it's not accurate at all.

*Paxton felt a bit sad at Trinity's response.  He could see why the Devil Horns loved her and wouldn't want to seperate from her.  She seemed to be all heart and selfless.  She was a good soul, but at the same time, he wished that that soul was a member of his ship.*  **Paxton:** I guess I can't go against your wishes.  You'd burn the ship to ashes, first off... and second, i don't think I could live with knowing that I caused you emotional harm.  Your husband really is a lucky man... I hope he always knows that.   *He tried to sit up and was once again rewarded with a sharp pain in his chest, but sat up anyway.*  **Paxton:** Either way, it was a good thing we bumped into each other, even though it almost ended with both of us dying.... Hopefully next time we meet will be a bit more calm. 
Of the top tiers, he's probably the one that requires the most "work" to get the most out of, so you're less likely to run into a really good one online. Whereas it's easier to get the most out of a Warlord or Peacekeeper, so it's not uncommon to see people utilizing those characters to the fullest in your games. But if you watch super high level Conqs play their class, you can see how strong they are. 
This makes me want to hear johnny karaoke "Jessie's girl"
Yeah, me neither.  There was one that I thought I needed to destroy to move forward so I hid behind a nearby wall and threw bomb at him for like 20 minutes and took out less than 20% of his life.  That's when I decided to just run for it, and made it haha

I mean $215 bi weekly for 8 years is like $40-45 grand if I did my math correctly. Can you ever buy something for 40 grand with a small amount down, and not be underwater for quite some time. If you are financing a brand new car and can't afford that amount, you are by definition underwater which is what 99% of auto sales. To answer your question more accurately, the car will never be worth more than the amount of money you paid for it, it will always be under water. If she likes the car and will like it for 8 years, and can afford her payment, why do you need to consider it underwater. Can't you just be happy buying exactly what you wanted and paying for it slowly over time. If she plans to sell this car or trade it into another car before the next 8 years, you will definitely be in a negative equity situation and likely underwater for the duration of the contract. It's all perspective, she picked it out, let her love it and pay for it and you never have to think you are underwater. When you become dissatisfied and try to buy another 40 thousand dollar car before you finished paying for your first 40 thousand dollar car, this is the scenario that causes serious negative equity and seriously underwater loans.

Hello darkness my old friend
How did the white/blue thing work? Isn't there a rule in place that orgs aren't allowed more than one team?
I'm getting the 1700 with the asrock killer board. I'll use the spire cooler that comes with it till I can get a noctua or comparable cooler. I've got enough for the cup when preorders charge thursday, then get paid on Friday to pay for the mb (releasing on the 7th) and a rx480. I'm just going to roll with the shitty hdds from my laptop till I have the money for replacements. It'll be ghetto but it'll be mine. I'm Actully poor lol. I'm hoping this rig will last, with upgrades, maybe 8 years if I'm lucky. My last desktop was a phenom ii 955 with a xfx 7770. Atm, I'm on a laptop jurryrigged to still work that has a a8-3500m.. This is going to be one Hell of a upgrade
I would commend that techies.
No. I don't think criminal penalties should be added to the Act. No, I don't think this is Fraud under $5000. No, I don't think up to a 2 year term is reasonable.  Seriously. What type of Province do you want to live in.   This happens way less than you think. I don't know what news you read, but seriously...this shit rarely happens.
I'd suggest that a disease organism would work best. Think weaponized influenza. It would be something, I suspect, that would be easy for an 'advanced alien race' to accomplish. Indeed, most of today's advanced nations could do it with little effort and no new technology.

Ha, fair enough! I'm with you all, lifelong Twins fan, been a rough stretch, it's made me overly cynical !
That's fair. The damage reduction does give Bastion effectively over 400+ HP which does make him a lot harder to deal with.   However my original comment was simply  directed at the Hanzo ult claim. There was a gif posted earlier showing Hanzo ulting a turret Bastion who never fell below 200 HP while healing and sitting through the entirety of the dragon.   That is actually a misleading video. The person who recorded it did it in a custom server with 200% healing enabled. Said person has since deleted that post but the gif has been spreading and there have been many posts since then stating Bastion can live through a full Hanzo ult which is not true.  That is all I wanted to clarify because it appears many people are using that example as a big  reason to nerf Bastion when the evidence itself is inherently false.

It should be back now! 
If cost is a concern just keep using the Archer.  I reused a Linksys WRT3200 when I upgraded to an AC LR.  It worked just fine for around a year until it crapped out and moved to a USG.  I prefer the USG over the Edgerouters as you can manage the whole deal from the Unifi software.  If down the road you want to move to a managed switch you can add a Unifi and still keep using that same interface.  But unless you have some feature you need the Archer doesn't do there is no reason to not just keep using that.   The LR may not perform any better than the Lite.  The LR has stronger transmission range but if the devices he's using can't transmit back it's pointless, the LR isn't better for everyone.  Same with the Pro.  If you don't use devices and the bandwidth to take advantages of the extra features it has it's just wasted money. 
People, for as self assured as they are here, are wrong so much that if we actually kept track no one here would have any cred at all. We're pretend experts.

Scumbag Steve: says atheists aren't a group because they only share one trait.   Includes himself in a group that only shares one trait (loss of a loved one).   Seriously, you are just as bad as any religious fundamentalist. Hopefully you figure that out once you're not an edgy teenager, otherwise you're going to have a lonely life.   Edit: removed the last "grow up" because I think I said it enough.   I was an edgy teenage atheist once too. You'll (hopefully) understand eventually, that you sound just like the people you're so desperately trying to distance yourself from.

And the reasons anti-zoos use are reasons they believe are "invincible", such as their "consent" argument. They also expect there to be no opposition to them, and view any opposition to their agenda as "sick" or "depraved".  Of course, anti-zoos are more outspoken than zoos, because it won't hurt them to say anti-zoo stuff, but an outspoken zoo has to worry all the time (worries anti-zoos don't have to deal with).

&gt; Since zero times any number is zero, then when the mantissa is all zeros, it doesn't matter what the exponent is, the whole number is still 0.  That's not true in IEE754. For "normal" numbers, the mantissa has an implied bit 1 before all stored bits.  In order to represent the number 0, you have to use an exponent with all bits set to 0. Exponents with bits set to all 0 or all 1 are used for things like 0, NaN, Infinity and denormal numbers.

I studied abroad in Paris. I absolutely love the city.  With that being said, the biggest thing you need to know is how to avoid the scam artists.  Common sense and a thousand-yard stare should be good most of the time, but the scammers are creative.  Specifically around Sacre-Coeur, there will be scammers who will place a string around your wrist, acting like they are tying you a bracelet. Shut that shit down immediately. Do not be nice. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.   In addition, keep your wallet in your front pocket. During crowded periods on the metro or on the streets, it's easy to be a pickpocket victim. If it's ever really crowded, I advise just putting one hand in the same pocket as your wallet to be extra safe.   If you're into reading, check out Shakespeare and Co. It's an old, famous book store. I found it really cool, plus it's right alongside the left bank (I think that's what it's called) where Notre Dame is.  If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask. I just typed up the first things that came to mind. I'm actually going back to Paris for a week this May also, so maybe I'll C U there!

Hi, any chance you'd be interested in a second code?
This in every way.  Everytime me and mine have an issue we sit down and discuss it. We get upset and argue but we hash it out. The next morning were closer than the day before. Because we grew, and we grew together.  I tell my girlfriend this all the time. Please tell me if I do or say something that bothers her. Because if I come home from work grumpy, pour a glass of whiskey and sit outside and smoke for until she's gone to bed, that's a tough day.  If I start doing that too often, it's a problem. If I become a functional alcoholic who doesn't talk to you in five years, yes I'm a shit person, but you also watched me turn into this garbage man and didn't say a word. Sometime I get caught up and don't see how my actions impact her. I try to be better about it every day, but I'm human, I fault and I slip, keep me in line. And I'll do the same for her.  People change over time, key to staying together is changing in ways that compliment each other. Encourage good change, discourage bad change. Do that for each other and you'll both be better people and even better together.

&gt;Balance mainly based on "big data" analytics. &gt; &gt;PK is fine. Slightly above 50% win/loss in duels. 2v2 4v4 she is even lower win/loss because of her low health. &gt; &gt;Warlord is super high win/loss ratio &gt; &gt;Kensei is high win/loss ratio &gt; &gt;45%-55% win/loss ratio is OK for them &gt; &gt;Lawbringer is low tier in duels, around 46%. In team fights he's top tier &gt; &gt;Lawbringer will be buffed for duels without breaking him in team fights &gt; &gt;Most of his kills are environmental kills. Which is artificially raising his win/loss rate in team fights &gt; &gt;Overall data matrix, balance is pretty good (except Warlord) and they are happy  "Big data" analytics is a nice buzzword phrase to throw around, but I really hope they take actual player feedback more seriously. A character's win/loss ratio doesn't do much to explain the "why" and "how", only the end results. The fact that they think overall balance is "pretty good" worries me a lot that they're completely out of touch with this game.

How old is the house? The microwave is mounted over the range?   I'd guess there wasn't a microwave when the house was built and when the kitchen got remodeled they just wired the microwave to the old wire for the hood. The hood is usually just #14-2 run off the kitchen lighting.  You should probably pull a new circuit for the microwave.

Oh we don't want to kill any of you, you're doing that on your own, just keep that shit in that mass that you call the Arab world. 
Most bi folks, here and elsewhere, that I interact with tend to see bi and pansexuality as mostly a pedantic distinction that we kind of flub for convenience - some people see it as kind of an ideological distinction wherein pan means gender and sex don't even really factor but i thankfully have yet to meet a bi person who uses the bi designation to exclude other genders beyond cis male/female (I'm sure they exist but they seem fairly minor). You can use the kinsey scale to get a feel for where you sit, but try not to freak out too much about labels. Mostly they're just an anchoring point with which you can say, OK, other people are this way too and this is what it's called, or for other people to be able to understand your experiences that they don't share. It's a process and you figure out what matters a big deal to you and what doesn't, and I've found that mostly in the bi community we're happy just being pretty laid back.   To answer your question if I haven't yet, either label would work fine, likely. If your community isn't super aware of bi issues (or even lgbt issues in general, like mine is), I would stick with bi if you're thinking about coming out or dating or whatever - it's a little easier to conceptualize than pan for people who don't think outside heteronormativity or strict homosexuality. If youre worried about being trans inclusive, pan can be a good way to signal that, but again, I've found that not super necessary.   In any case, congrats on figuring this out about yourself and don't worry! You'll kind of get a feel for it.

We have a diversified layout, but the thing is, is that we also provide insurance and partake in the ACA health exchanges. This requires us to use a government provided edge server to assess and calculate risk with a series of s3 buckets made available for reports and backups. We're not given much say on this, making this an Achilles heel if you will.

&gt;That leaves one of your teammates to 1v2 a buffed up guy, a neutral trade in 4v4 since both sides end up fighting the same shit.   A buffed up guy, again, that knowingly is my inferior. what a threat.   &gt;And yes, I always knew how to perma link but why should I have before, to prove a scrub is a scrub to himself in his own shit thread?   I'm the scrub how?   &gt;And yes, the implications are serious. He will probably, wait let's not be drastic, he will maybe try to beat his opponent.   The implications that the guy claiming he'll do whatever it takes to win, including shit talking, playing "mind games" which by his definition is purposely trying to piss off his oponent to, in his own words "get them to play worse" so that he can beat them.   Yeah what a *stellar* competitor he is.   Its such a fucking chore having a conversation with you. The fact that you never actually make your own statements is infuriating. Whenever I call out something you say specifically, you retreat back to find some random comment to point to to try and steer the conversation away. It's growing increasingly tiresome.

Jeff has been adamant he doesn't want to work a WWE schedule. He's said every time he's fallen off the wagon, it's been when he's beat up from working their schedule. Maybe they go there, but I just don't see Jeff being up for it unless he's so mad at Impact he wants to show them what they lost - which was their gateway to the mainstream wrestling fan they've chased for 15 years.   Matt doesn't like the travel either, he likes being at home, he also likes having creative control. Basically if TNA hadn't been on the verge of closing down and worried about other stuff, none of this happens with Matt. He's probably fighting the bookers step by step, instead he floors it. It's not my cup of tea, though I appreciate the parody the character, storylines and matches are on modern wrestling. But he had the freedom, and he won't get that in WWE.

Agmatine,  it won't make it stronger but doesn't mess with your tolerance and for me anyways, prolongs the effects. 
&gt; I'm skeptical that Erdogan can return to a sensible path regardless of its outcome.  I disagree with a lot of what you said before but, isolating this argument specifically: Yes. Absolutely.  What people must understand is that Erdoğan has declared war on everyone in Turkey not with him. There's no backing down from anything which could weaken him internally; I mean think about it, AKP loses power and there's no doubt he would go to jail if tried by a fair jury.   So any sort of domestic or foreign policy which involves Tayyip "chilling out" is off the table. edit: I had initially quoted the wrong sentence.

LOL!  "Gun ambush"..... yeah, a bunch of guns got together, snuck out of their owner's houses and jacked some poor innocent person.  Also, love this, "Detectives want to identify an assault-rifle wielding gunman"  That'll be hard considering he wasn't wielding an "assault rifle". As sn assault rifle is defined as having a fully automatic capability. Which this did not.  So, typical uninformed, or worse, agenda pushing "reporting" here.
&gt; but weight will never change.  &gt;you're selling a product that has 35% more nic then advertised, stop the presses!  Effective gravity does change with location, altitude, and distance from the equator: therefore so does weight.

It's hard to see how either method can by out by more than a very tiny amount as any errors will be the same at any set location.
Sigh.  I just burned my last bit of goodwill with my uncle, trying to make him understand that the president's intentions and official positions aside, he has given tacit encouragement to racist and violent elements among his supporters as evidenced by the murders in Kansas and the threats against Jews.  I left what I thought was a calm, thoughtful reply and returned an hour later to find his response, "Wow, you're full of hate."  A moment later I noticed that he, my aunt, and my adult cousins had all unfriended me.  I have literally no interest in repairing my relationship with them anytime soon, but I hope they eat crow when Trump is finished.
Cue up a butter to come tell us this is just an issue of prying into the private matters of consenting adults. Maybe the customer and the pimp are consenting but in a lot of cases, the girl was lured into the business through any number of shady ways and certainly wouldn't consent if she had a choice. Sure they did it with cash before but now they have another option. Is that a good thing?   I certainly wouldn't want to be an exchange known for servicing this sort of business. Some statists might take note of something like that.

He's *always* finished higher than he was predicted too preseason. Literally every year he outperforms what the media expects from his roster. He's never had as bad or a worse than season to what they expect  It should also be noted that we pay our assistants half waht other schoold do- Our DC was taken by Miami for a pay raise, the one fbofore him by UF, the one before him by Texas. Our D-line coach took the same job at A&amp;M. All got pay raises.   It's not mullens fault, it's just lack of resources. But it should be noted that this is a huge reason he can't sustain success on D, and he wouldn't have that problem at your place for example.

Maybe that's where Jane left all of the tax returns. It would explain why it's been 9+ months since they promised to provide them and they still haven't quite found the time to dig them up. 
Now you're just being obtuse. It's conjugated in the original sentence. It's INCORRECTLY conjugated but it IS conjugated nonetheless making the intended word a verb.   And yes I already agreed with you. It can also mean breast. Once again. You are correct. Mama can mean breast. 
Already?! For a game this huge, that sounds disappointing. 😕
It's pretty good advice. I'm too self conscious about my thunder thighs/thunder body to ride anyone's face unless they're explicitly clear about them enjoying my bod. 
Any info on the movement?
Jess Phillips is typically forthright when I text to ask her about the political events of last week, and what they mean for her party. “The Copeland result is a historic catastrophe,” she replies on Saturday morning, in between moving house and trying to organise her two young children. “Those all about ‘straight-talking honest politics’ are spinning like ballerinas, trying to make out it is just a blip. The voting public are not stupid. They see through this. If the Labour Party and is leaders don’t wake up, this catastrophic result will be the first of many and we’d have done little more than collude with Tory success.” In typical Phillips style, she signs off the message with a cheery kiss.  Jess Phillips is the 35-year-old Member of Parliament for Birmingham Yardley who famously told Diane Abbott to f*** off.  Corbynites went on to call this racist (actually, Abbott had called the young MP “sanctimonious” for daring to question the lack of women appointments in Labour’s front bench, and as Phillips says now, “I’ll tell anyone to f*** off if they’re rude to me, is the truth”). Phillips is sparky, bolshie, a “proud parliamentarian” who got pregnant at 23, a month after getting together with Tom, a lift engineer who has since given up work to look after the kids.  (“We’d known each other for ages” she says, in between sucks on an e-cigarette.)  She worked for Woman’s Aid before becoming an MP in 2015, and has continued to bang her feminist drum in the Commons - she chairs the Women’s Parliamentary Labour Party, and on International Women’s Day last year, she stood up in the Commons and read out the names of the 120 females killed in the previous 12 months. Last autumn, she successfully campaigned for extra funding to be ring-fenced for women’s refuges. Damian Green, the work and pensions secretary, congratulated her on her achievements, but her own party seemed less keen to pat her on the back, with one Corbynite blog accusing her of only ever having been a business manager at Women’s Aid (she managed the refuges).  She is not backwards about coming forwards, and has now written a funny, frank book called Everywoman, which is all about finding the courage to speak the truth. “The Labour Party needs to sit in a corner and have a word with itself,” she tells me. “It needs a smack about the face. A serious, wet fish to the chops! A shaking.” I make the observation that it seems to me that the party is behaving like a petulant teenager and she agrees. “Oh, a terrible petulant teenager -  like a child who is saying ‘I’m going to get what I want and if not I’m going to cry about it’. I think they are waking up to the fact that we are electorally in a disaster.”  Phillips says that “being in perpetual, credible opposition is one thing, but being in perpetual weak opposition is just soul-destroying”. She has great friends in the Labour Party - Alison McGovern, and she was close to Jo Cox. But, she seems to have a far jollier relationship with the Tories, writing in her book about eating a packet of sandwiches in a Co-Op cafe with Jacob Rees-Mogg, “and I can confirm he did not ask for swan on wholemeal... although it is true he was the only person in a double-breasted pin-striped suit”.  Are the Tories nicer to her? “Oh yeah, no doubt about it! They call me Aunt Pol [after Aunt Pol from Peaky Blinders] because she’s always smoking a fag like she’s running the joint.” She is particularly fond of Sir Nicholas Soames. “He gave me genuine dieting advice the other day. He’s half the man he was. He was telling me that you’ve got to have a boiled egg for breakfast and then throughout the day have 'Moo-lar’ yoghurts” - she says gently ribbing his posh accent - “and just chicken and salad in the evening. I thought, ‘If anyone had told me that I was going to get dieting advice from Winston Churchill’s grandson I might not have believed them.” By contrast, she has only spoken to John McDonnell “about twice”. I just don’t move in the same circles.” But you’re friends with Nicholas Soames, I say. “Well, he’s a character. So he seeks you out to tell you witty things.”  Her parents - her mother was an NHS manager and her father an English teacher - gave her membership to the Labour Party when she was 14. Her "mom", as she calls her (this, she says, is what mums are called in Birmingham), died of cancer when Jess was about to turn 30, but the MP does not touch on her death in the book. “When I think about her I don’t ever think about her dying. She had cancer, sarcoma, but she had it in her leg, and she was being treated here in the UK for a deep-vein thrombosis.  So she was given blood thinners and stuff.“  Phillips seems keen not to dwell too much on the darker details. “Then she went to France on holiday, was bitten by a mosquito and her whole leg swelled up, and then went to a French hospital, and they diagnosed her having this massive tumour in her leg. And then she had had it removed within a day on the French health service. Bear in mind my mum was an NHS manager, so if she couldn’t get the right care, God only knows what hope there is for any of the rest of us. I mean, she would have died in a ditch to defend the NHS, but it definitely had its moments with her.”  The cancer had in fact spread to her lungs; she was told she had six months to live, but paid for pioneering treatment in Germany that kept her alive for another two and a half years. “She was good for two years, but then she couldn’t walk, she was delusional… I remember the day she died, I was at work [at Woman’s Aid]  and they rang and said she’s going to die within hours, and I drove, it was about 15 miles, and I was stuck in traffic and just thought ‘I need to get home, I need to get home, my mum’s about to die’, and I pulled up outside my own house, not  Mum and Dad’s house, which was a few streets away. And then I realised, ‘It’s going to be OK. Because you’re a grown-up and when you were saying go home, you ended up where your children and your husband live. This is just life. It goes on.’ I went into proper mourning when she was diagnosed, but I think by that point I’d come to terms with it.”  The book is dedicated to her mother, as well as Jo Cox. Phillips finds it profoundly disturbing that her death seems to have changed nothing. “On the day of Jo’s special memorial, I was interviewed on Channel 4 alongside Alastair Campbell and I was saying, ‘This will change people’s attitudes.’ He said, ‘It won’t make the blindest bit of difference.’ Turns out he does know what he’s talking about, Alastair.”  For, Jess, Jo will always embody the idea of what a good politician is. "She was an exception to the rule. But I would caveat that by saying that the people who think politicians are all in it for ourselves… well, politicians are ultimately quite private people and really nice people, they just don’t come across that way. We have to get better at appearing normal.”  And Phillips is certainly a good starting point.

Like I'd fall for that if I was your superior. Just open a window and collect some ocean water.
didn't come to play school
I had the afternoon off, so have played both as and against the new Bastion. He's a tough cookie, but he's not invincible. I've seen him win and seen him lose.   Don't put him on a pedestal. Expect to see lots of him tonight in the placements. The team that builds entirely around him is a one-trick pony, and counterable.  I expect to see lots of dead Bastions tonight. I hope to make a few of 'em that way myself. ;) 
I certainly hope the fight isn't like that!  Gonna be a lot of swinging from Hunto and ground game from The Reem in my eyes. Wouldn't think Reem would want to keep it on the feet.
Yep, ask me anything,  I will totally confess!

Telling her won't ruin your past years of friendship, those years already happened and nothing will change those experiences.  If you might not see her ever again then telling her might just make the transition harder for her and not ever lead to anything like a romantic relationship with her though.  Do you hope that telling her will make her stay and want to be with you? If you think that is a reasonable outcome and think you will regret not telling her for the rest of your life then you should.

In this case Bastion was redesigned, not buffed. The idea is having the hero in a more balanced state, so Blizzard can easily buff or nerf him without making him either useless or a must pick.

**Submission Statement**  Economics student at Bucknell University gets branded a "racist" and "facist" for holding views outside those of others on campus.  --  "A liberal arts education should push students to take intellectual risks and see the world in new ways."  "Leftists, in an effort to make campuses welcoming — ostensibly, for everyone — end up frequently silencing conservative and libertarian students. They paint any argument that isn’t progressive as immoral, so conservative students can find themselves branded as such. Needless to say, this can be socially isolating."

I think he's talking about fluidwinds (chashao). He was a caster and maybe part time analyst for TPA. Then he became coach of FW and caster, but I think he quit the coaching position this season.   The main coaches now are Steak and Winds (jungler for s3 Gamma bears (ex-FW) and jungled for S4 TPA when riot rules prevented Maple, Swordart and NL from playing due to age restrictions.)
He spoke at the rally against islamophobia a couple of weeks ago. It was nice to see him engaged in the community.

Just play the game like everyone else
Well, I wouldn't say it's stunting your learning curve--it's a game! Play what you want to! I do advise learning one or two champions really well, but if you start to notice yourself hitting a plateau, what can help if you want to improve can be trying out new champions and learning new things. ARAM/other game modes are good places to start, but there's nothing quite like playing an actual game of SR with a champion to learn on them.  Good luck with whatever path you choose!

I'd be really nice and amenable. If you're the last man on earth and you aren't cooperative, you're going to get turned into a impregnation machine. If you stay on their good side and play it right you could be a God and that starts by cultivating a good imagine to the female public.
lol at this response  love it
As with most updates there's always somebody who doesn't like it and wants the game to be like before. Seems like this time those people were loud enough or reasonable enough to scare the hosts into not upgrading their Minecraft-versions.  I can't make any statement as to which versions are more broadly supported because I mostly play on private servers, but if I were a server owner I would offer both.
Perfect. Meet here then?

How do you know you like something better if you haven't tried the other?
Lol! I have similar moments when I get high, except my reason is I can't make a decision. Like last night, I was already high and I turned off the tub after filling it. My thought was, "Should I get in now, or hit the bong one more time and then get in." I literally caught myself walking around in circles because I kept halfway making a decision between the two and then changing my mind. I ended up hitting the bong again and then getting in. Lol
I probably will. 
I can't get this long-press thing to work
I believe HSBC and royal bank of Scotland have assets in the trillions. Maybe they will be a teller.
So the 7th beast is always a flop? That's completely unintuitive and arguably just straight up bad.   Playing 7 beats over X turns will almost always result in the better ones being played last, which gives you the highest chances of flopping them if you have literally anything else on the board.   If your board is completely empty this flops the last thing you played, and it gets progressively worse for each minion you already have.   It's not that the card itself is bad, cause 1 mana summon almost any beast is great value, but the way it works is really messy and unintuitive.

I think I will be the big "Huh?" response.  I am a Seattle all year commuter since 2009, 9 miles each way.  My stable is mostly steel bikes, some with fenders.  Bikes still going strong.  Keep the drivetrain clean, if you can.  Or just re-lube it occasionally.  I replace the chain at least yearly, not much I can do even if I did clean after each commute (which would be twice/day).  That all said, I won't dip my toe into the lube holy war.  Pick one and stick with it.  See how it suits your riding.  Expect to make mistakes.  Learn how to replace your own chain (it's easy and cheap).  If you find that you are riding more and more in the rain, consider "investing" in removable fenders, such as the SKS Raceblades.  The other part which seems to wear quickly in rainy weather is the rim, if you have rim brakes.  New wheels every other year so far.  It's a bike, go ride.  To hijack, its more important to adjust your riding style during different weather events.  Always consider how visible you may or may not be, and how the weather will affected your handling and braking.

Our school had touch screen monitors for the cafeteria to log purchases. When the cafeteria closed, the computers would be left on, just begging for someone to mess with them. So a friend and I drew stupid doodles in MS Paint on each computer, then set them to be the wallpaper for the computers.
I'm basing it off how big it feels to me. I'd say I am a decent judge considering I've played a fair few fighting games that have moves with much faster startup yet are still reactable.  If you want to talk about unreliable your argument is just your poorly founded opinion. On the other hand I can bring up any tournament footage or high level vod, which if you're unable to find one for yourself I can go and find it for you.  Better yet, heres [frame data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gXFc5po99N8PKRmIa0lRs7eCU-QdpdVILIaPGJNy32A/edit#gid=1327849931) for Nobushis gb timing it has 34f of startup. That is a huge amount of time for you to prepare your reaction. I also haven't seen anything to suggest that characters have gb timing with a wildly different startup so I see no reason why people should've been complaining about their difficulty unless they were fundamentally bad.

Jesus man, everyone has dead people. It doesn't make you special.  I actually can't stand Ms. Huffington but I don't freak the fuck out everytime I see an article. People are pissed because of his lack of ownership. When you're a leader it's imperative that you take ownership. The fact that Trump can't even do that shows how weak he is. 
&gt; Anarcho-communism is not pro-democracy  &gt; Anarcho communism is based on ultimate direct democracy   Choose one, is anarcho-communism for or against democracy?  &gt;  no press, no government  Anarchism never directs that there be no press allowed, that doesn't make sense. And also, for the thousandth time today, *anarchism does not mean no government, it means no state* &gt; It's famous for it's historical precedent of oppressing minorities and sending them to labor camps    Anarcho Communism doesn't have a precedent of oppressing minorities, yes there were labor camps but those were largely to put people to work to ensure the survival of the communes

Nope. Most places only have one server farm. Facebook and google are the leaders in datacenter storage. They only have 3-6 centers. This is why the premise of Mr. Robot was scary to those in cyber security. Its shows people that big companies don't have multiple redundancies in place. Banks keep their servers in one or two data centers. 
Cats with cerebellar hypoplasia are honestly awesome pets. My friends had a wobble kitty and he was the friendliest little trooper you ever met. He had no clue anything was wrong with him. He did need a *little* more attention than most cats, but he loved to play and snuggle and do cat things. We just got to enjoy his wobbles as a bonus.

Now, what you're saying makes sense, but I don't think you're correct. The problem is that the Democratic party establishment both A) Doesn't really want to move farther left, and B) Sucks at effectively doing their jobs (which are legislating and *marketing*). The Republican party both wants to move right and is damned good at marketing.  Source: The Republican party has done exactly what you're saying the Democrats can't.
