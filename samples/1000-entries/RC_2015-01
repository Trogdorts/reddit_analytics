I completely agree. I've spent that long staring at it sober..
&gt;&gt;If a woman wants to give up a child for adoption with a named father, she is unable to do so without the father's consent.  &gt;That is easy enough to do. Simply don't name the father.  Women are *only* not financially responsible *if* there is no named father. If the father isn't named, he's not on the hook for child support either, so *it doesn't matter*.  You're deliberately removing context and responding to sentences that go together to form an overall argument separately in a way that does not make sense. At this point you're being intentionally misleading to twist this into what you want it to be instead of actually participating in the spirit of the argument. 
I haven't. Still trying to get someone to commit.   Where are you located?

I love it.  Okay, based upon point (6), is it right for a Christian to say, "it is not me doing the sin, but sin in me" [Romans 7:17]?  Or is the passage saying something quite different than what Ryle understands it to mean?
I like this idea, though just to confirm though technically if 6 bosses dropped loot you needed but lost, does that mean you get 24 counter points?  If you lose even using counters, does that mean its lost for the duration of the raid? Like  Kargath drops something you need, lose loot, get +4 on roll, butcher drops weapon, you still lose, does the counter apply or would you get +8 for the next boss as you still lost?
Yes.

Unfortunately at this time of point you can have the best CPU, GPU available to buy and you still would not get 30 FPS in Cities. The game is only optimized for specific CPU's and GPU's that the developers use.

My Great to the power of 6 ..or 7 grandfather came over here from Germany around 1776. On the ship ride over his mother dies.   Two weeks off the boat his father dies. He was only around 9 years old.   He then was sold as an "indigent servant" he earned his independence by fighting in the revolutionary war.   He moved from ohio to near Pittsburgh, lived to be 101 years old.

My health insurance covered my wisdom teeth as opposed to my dental insurance. I think it depends on what type of doctor does the procedure. The one who did mine was some type of specialist, not a dentist. Might want to ask your dentist about this and get referred out. 
People should just stop saying this phrase entirely. It's too invasive. There are many reasons why it might be hurtful. Maybe the person doesn't want kids, or maybe they *can't* have them, or maybe they recently tried and failed! You can't possibly know how a person feels about being a parent or childbearing unless you are an intimate friend.   When it comes to genetics, people are downright idiotic about it. I inherited a bunch of stuff from my mom that is expensive, painful, and will bother me my entire life. Luckily I have good insurance. I had an autoimmune disease as a kid that almost killed me. If I were trying to create healthy, happy babies, I would not have suggested my parents get together, given the history of depression and early degenerative joint disease on both sides. The thing is, they believe it's their *right* to procreate. They're not thinking about it rationally.
It's been very helpful in this thread.
I totally agree, Bladess. Why follow the trend when they have an opportunity to create more? Mutants or some eerie-arse robots that may or may not be ex-military tech would be brilliant. The latter would have to be suitable rare, however, to make those brief encounters even more terrifying and deadly. If they do re-introduce blueprints like Legacy I imagine mutants as being more appropriate for abandoned buildings and loot points; cannibalistic bands pushed to the edge of society, inhabiting old ruins and maybe even one or two caves. Imagine if they even spawned small bands in the forests at night? Fuck that shit, I wouldn't even leave my house!

A lot of disrespecting of the league today.  Do you think we'll eventually need to see Garber publicly reprimanding the NYCFC ownership group (doubt it would happen though)?  
Mic City Sons would be the most accessible Heatmiser record for the Elliott fan. It was recorded shortly after the self-titled album (95') and contains the familiar style and melodies we know from his solo albums.  [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OHdCGnFSH8) a good example. Neil's contributions to that album are also decent.   I also really like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2_4hrbX_68&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL3BNH11YlQMPPDRHklJxwnux5YglmgEBP) tune from their less well known EP 'Yellow no. 5'.

#####&amp;#009;  ######&amp;#009;  ####&amp;#009;  [**Brutalist architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist%20architecture): [](#sfw)   ---  &gt;  &gt;__Brutalist architecture__ is a movement in architecture that flourished from the 1950s to the mid-1970s, descended from the [modernist architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture) movement of the early 20th century. The term does not derive from the word "brutal", but originates from the French *béton brut*, or "raw concrete", a term used by [Le Corbusier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier) to describe his choice of material. [British architectural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom) critic [Reyner Banham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reyner_Banham) adapted the term into "brutalism" (originally "New Brutalism") to identify the emerging style.  &gt;Brutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients, with numerous examples in Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, the Philippines, and Australia. Examples are typically massive in character (even when not large), [fortress-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification), with a predominance of exposed [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete) construction, or in the case of the "brick brutalists" ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together. There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the whole-site plan the main functions and people-flows of the buildings. Brutalism became popular for educational buildings (especially university buildings), but was relatively rare for corporate projects. Brutalism became favoured for many government projects, high-rise housing, and [shopping centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall) to create an architectural image that communicated strength, functionality, and frank expression of materiality.  &gt;In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture. In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness. "Brutalism" as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics; architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether. More recently, "brutalism" has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular – as a synonym for "brutal" – making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic.  &gt;====  &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/bk21nrm.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DHHS2_by_Matthew_Bisanz.JPG) - *Hubert H.

What is this from 
We were both born and raised in the Philippines. She moved to Germany in 2009 (her dad was German and wanted to go back). Weekly sleepovers turned to monthly Skype calls (and the occasional Facebook message), the 7-hour difference was hard for us. Then just last year (2013), I moved to WA (mom got remarried here). The 9-hour difference was tougher. She had a boyfriend and new friends, I had a boyfriend and new friends. We grew into different interests (she was more into partying, I was more into LoL and DnD) and... yeah. I miss her, though. We send each other a message once or twice a month asking how each other is but nothing really more than that.

No. It's fucking not. This is not normal behavior and you should be ashamed of trying to normalize unacceptable personality/ sociability traits like these. Go outside and force yourself to talk to people until it gets easy.  Stop being a victim.

Davey Crockett playing his fiddle and harmonizing with the Mexican Army band playing "deguello" outside the Alamo.

Are those polyester bell-bottom overalls?   Also, looking at the color pattern of Nick Nolte's disco overalls on the right, they should have had both of these guys wearing them (with Eddie Murphy wearing a brown shiny nylon dress shirt to compliment the beige shiny nylon dress shirt of Nick Nolte). That would show that the overalls  could work for either of the two featured skin colors. It would be a very 1970 thing to do, hitting the nexus point between progressive, blunt, and awkward.

A friend told me, "*Bulk till you hate yourself, cut till you hate life*". I'm still enjoying this *no calorie control* thing and am not yet disgusted with myself so.. I'm thinking of bulking up for life!
I'm in. 1) Yes, hard mode all the way. 2) Im sick of being a PMO addict of 9 years. I'm 24 now. Time for a change. My goal is to cure PIED and finally enjoy sex for the first time. 3) I'm doing this because I honestly feel this is my last chance... if I fail I'm pretty sure I'll be a PMO addict for the rest of my life... I WILL NOT FAIL, I WILL PREVAIL!!!
I get the feeling the T2 one's been done in some dark corner of the web.
Bugs I've noticed since the patch that really piss me off:  * Clicking on a spawn location and either 1) spawning underground in a completely different location, 2) spawning in the middle of nowhere, 3) dropping out of the sky and falling to your death.. in the middle of nowhere. * Random invisible walls blocking shots when I have a clear line of sight. Happened twice yesterday when I was using the SAS-R. Once was under a bridge, and another while on a rooftop farming a sunderer. Both times I had nothing blocking my view, but when I fired, I would see sparks fly in front of me and hear the glass shattering sound effect that indicated I'd shot a wall. Wtf? * Severe server lag. I'm talking, dying to people after I've killed them. I also killed somebody with an EM6 after I had already died and switched loadouts to a GD7-F. Movement seems warpy, people moving extra fast. It feels as though the server is trying to "catch up" and suddenly moves the player models forward extra fast.  * Been having the cloak glitch a lot. When infil, it gets stuck in this weird half-cloaked phase and I can't tell if I'm really cloaked or not. On HA, I occasionally get stuck glowing even when my shield is off. * Invisible people. Many invisible people. And no, I'm not talking about infils. * I'm sure there's more, I just can't remember them.

What an interesting question! I would have to say... We don't know. We know there are two pigments essentially a brown and red pigment that make up hair color. I'm pretty sure that the amount of red is controlled by 1 gene ( but MANY different alleles. ) We are not sure how many genes are involved in the amount of brown pigment. We just don't know enough to be able to predict offspring hair color.   Disclosure: I am an undergrad in Bio and am not 100% current on hair color inheritance research! =p There may be more up to date info out there.

I thought that comment really showed his arrogance. Like he's bragging about it almost. Why even say something like that?   I wish she had asked a follow up question about if he did cheat. 
The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February. The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required.  The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May. However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter.   Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper).   Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties.   Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final. The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley.   Long post but there you go. The League Cup isn't taken as seriously by bigger teams (hence why Sunderland, Swansea, Bradford, Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years) but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history.

Okay to be totally blunt I look at a few things when I think of gentrification.

Two dots and crossy road are good. So is bitcolor and super hexagon and strategery
Have fun skilling them up
Sure, but you would have to manually raise the strainer to keep it above beer level. Sounds like a pain to me when there's easier methods. I like to keep my attention on making sure the in-going side of the siphon is safely above the yeast cake/trub while racking. It seems like this would be hard to do without two people with the strainer method as your attention would be on the strainer.
If only MonoCorp sells X, then you have two options:  1. MonoCorp is selling X at a good enough price and quality, therefore you don't have competition. How is this bad? If no entrepreneur successfully competes against Mono-Corp that means no entrepreneur thinks it can produce a better product than MonoCorp. It's as good as it gets. Rejoice.  2. Monopoly Corp is selling X at a price and quality that people complain about, therefore an entrepreneur starts a competitor. Monopoly no more. If the competitor fails, see #1. If it succeeds, monopoly no more forever.

I've stuck with Coval as my go-to vendor since coming across them relatively early on in my vaping journey due to the 2x30ml/$20 Flavor of the Week specials' incentive and the quality of the liquids I've received through those promotions. Some of them aren't nearly favorites and I've also found some blends that I wouldn't have otherwise picked up that have turned out to be top ranking;  actually this week's [FOTW](http://www.reddit.com/r/ecig_vendors/comments/2qxcrd/buttery_nipple_and_pbb_cream_flavors_of_the_week/) are a couple of greats IMO. My favorites have changed up from time to time, currently I'm really liking 'Trails' the most (think trail mix) but I'm also enjoying getting to know '[Discovery](http://covalvapes.com/collections/artisan-series/products/discovery)'  it's new to me but I foresee it could become a contender before too long. The truth is Coval has exceeded my expectations and some of the blame for my not having tried [TVC](http://thevaporchef.com/), [Cyclops](http://www.cyclopsvapor.com/), [Keystone](http://keystonevapor.com/), [DBLiquids](http://www.dbliquids.com/), [Bombies](http://bombies.com/) or [Grizzly Vapes] (http://www.steammonkey.com/Default.asp) rests with Coval for providing those tasty vapes with competitive pricing, quick shipping and receptive, responsive customer service. I do feel I owe it to myself to try these and some other vendors, at the same time I feel like 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' and everything seems to be working well:)  I do enjoy seeing y'all recommending and promoting each other around these parts and hearing tell of your positive actions in the ecr and larger vaping community. Thanks for getting us the goods and the way you've gone about it!  TLDR;I like Coval's [Trails] (http://covalvapes.com/collections/cloud-series/products/trails). Go JuiceTeam Force!
I'd suggest a time Machine and go back to the early 2000's when it was on Toonami. I honestly don't know where you can find it online. It's worth the watch though.
Hadn't realized how simple it'd have been to just google the amount of land on earth like that. 
fuck how do you do that? That's all I ever wanna watch
When we made love the first time after my surgery for ovarian cancer I wore a lacy camisole to cover my huge ugly scar, because I was so self-conscious about how it looked. The first thing he did was to slowly pull up my top and kiss along entire length while telling me how beautiful I was. It was really romantic to me because he was so sincere; later on he told me that he likes the scar because it means that I survived :-)

oh this is really interesting -- I thought NYPD was doing this as an F-you to DeBlasio.   According to that, they're just scared for their safety.   But then again... isn't that what we pay them for?

Hey guys, that quote that has been flying around came from the article I posted and a post earlier here from reddit, so I wanted to post this here to make sure that quote with its more accurate translation is presented. Still, the article is VERY eye opening on Sakurai's design philosophy and is still worth a read.

Java is a lot more forgiving for beginners.  There's a lot less undefined behavior, so you're less likely to make something that accidentally works until it blows up in your face.  C or C++ can work well, but only with a good mentor to steer you away from the footguns.
Speaking of loads... :P
Good luck throwing a screen against Arizona.
paycoin appears to be a scam. there is not any proof that any retailers have agreed to accept it. the guaranteed $20 floor isn't actually working out. premine makes it a glorified ripple. sucks when people are going to lose money.

&gt; If I wanted a wildcat varmint upper, it'd be 223AI  I'd though about an improved 223, and it definitely struck my fancy.  I also looked into the 20 practical.  But my biggest draw to the 20 tactical is that there is that there seems to be no fire-forming required.  Just size and go. 
Yeah, they've just started moving everything or if the os and into apps.

by "have a photo taken" do you mean "slice and dice him up a little bit?"

How about this: this year i could have died, i could have gotten the worst year of my life, and for a few moments it seemed so, but instead i had the best one yet. I've just spent new years in from of the Eiffel tower, to fulfill a special someone's lifelong dream. 2014 for me was an adventure i'll tell my grankids, someday, when they are old enough. All from good and bad luck, from taking chances and taking life on the chin, pressing foward, not giving up. So for luck's sake, give the card to whoever's comment is above mine when you read this. Life is luck and luck is what we make of life. Cheers and happy new year.

I got pregnant when I was 18, and actually had my son only a couple of weeks after turning 19. It sounds like you have an amazing support system, which makes all the difference! I've found that being a young mom is pretty nice, because you have the energy now to keep up with the demands of a child. As someone who's been in your situation, I can offer some consolation! It's not that bad! PM me if you need someone to talk to.
2. 10 is the end of a cycle, so I'd tie up loose ends and look for what inspires you with a clear head.  3. Definitely look around at better options! They are there!  4. Enjoy your health but don't overindulge. Every choice you make effects you down the road. I'd say this card is telling you to work on your health more and enjoy the benefits of the life changes.   AS far as the Chariot, I'd think maybe its an authority figure or a goal you're working towards. Is going to be difficult overcome but with the towers destruction also comes beginnings.

I hear you.  Due to the lingering effects of a head injury I cannot even stomach gaming. (between the vertigo and concentration sorts of problems... yuck)  Reading, youtube, and netflix are about all I can handle.
If you are completely inexperienced, then choose a good no load family like Vanguard, Fidelity or T Rowe Price.  Choose a Target Date fund with a date close to the year you turn 65.  Done.  Later as you get more experience you can choose an asset allocation for your own personal risk tolerance and reduce fees even further with a small number of ultra low cost index funds.  But for now, just buy the target date fund and take some time to read some basic books.

Getting water boarded is one of the most intense experiences you will ever have. My friends and I did it just to see if it was as bad as they say it is. The longest anyone lasted was about 20 seconds. You feel like you're drowning, and this was with people I knew would stop the moment I asked them to.

Exactly this. I'd probably give you 6/10 in these pictures, but if you fixed the eyebrows and stopped doing a Kermit the Frog smile then you could be a cute 7.
If you think that's bad, I get a bad 5ghz connection on my iPad while taking a shit at home.
Wasteland 2, Divinity: Original Sin, and Dragon Age: Inquisition come to mind. They're all flawed and I don't know if any of them are truly amazing games but they did what they wanted to do quite well and are all really fun if you enjoy the kind of gameplay they offer.
Well that makes two of us.

I only tip for adequate to good service. I dont tip at all for bad service. And I wont eat at a restaurant that requires I always tip no matter what.  As I understand it, a LOT of redditors either previously or currently work a waitstaff position and think they deserve a tip no matter what.  Tipping is meant as an incentive for good service.
Hipfire should never have been like this. It's clear if you've ever used the Sac3s for an extended period of time. There's no reason to hipfire outside of knife range and at that point you'll just get knifed/punched through bullets anyways.
Easy. Because it's a shotgun. And people don't like shotguns, explosives, and melee in Naughty Dog games. That's why the launcher is 4 points and the machete was initially 4 points and underpowered

I am. Ultimately it shouldn't matter if it's a good game - total sales is what matters. No publisher is going to say "well, your game sold $1B over the last year, but it had awful first day sales, so we're never going to let your studio make a game again". It *might* effect bonuses, but I'd argue having developer bonuses tied to initial sales creates some really perverse incentives.
It seems normal for me. Unclicked is blue, clicked is purple. This is pretty universal, right?

Hahaha, that's awesome.  I've done something similar - saw what I thought was an stooped, older gentleman on the bus (his head was turned to the side, face partially hidden by scraggly grey hair and a wool cap, and the skin on his hands looked pretty rough) and stood up to offer my seat.  He tried to decline (head still turned away) but I insisted.  He finally took the seat in resignation, looked up at me as he sat down and muttered "I'm not even that old :(".  He was probably in his early-mid fourties.  Since then, I've developed a small anxiety when I'm on the bus and someone of dubious age hops on and stands near me, especially if it's an older woman.  I don't want to be that asshole that doesn't give up her seat, but I also worry that I might offend someone by thinking they look much older than they actually are :(

Guess it depends on the context, but I can see cases where it's fine to use Mass Rez on a single person.

If you're investing in S.H. Figuarts, you really need to invest in stands for your figures. If something topples and gets broken, scratched, etc., it's not like hunting down a new one at the local store. You just threw away at least (*very* conservatively) $30.
I'm not sure about the new ones but for the old ones, they need custom work. Also, gains aren't as big (unless you go all out) because Mercedes doesn't really skimp on their designs.
That's pretty damn cool! I didn't know that happened.
It's a really good printer, but not without it's own issues.  The biggest irritation to me was PLA leaking from the hotend, but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue.  You can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end they're glad they went with it.  Once you do find the sweet spot though it's a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 24/7.  In fact Lulzbot prints 24/5 with over a hundred of them.  As /u/jebba said in another thread there's a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer.  I'm sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend.  I can't say anything really bad about Makerbot's 2/2x.  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit they're solid workhorses.  The 5th gens... stay away for now.  MakerGear M2 is a really solid printer.  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhub's guide the printer is very well liked.  A printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2.  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but it's far less picky with settings.  It's my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels.  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflex/ABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though.  If you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built.  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site.  It doesn't hold your hand when it comes to documentation though.
Great Article. Thanks for sharing. If we don't sign Upton to a long term deal, I'm happy we have Renfroe or Liriano to possibly take his spot.

Hi!  How high can you jump?
sitting on my patio listening to the ocean in Mauritius. Just flew over from Madagascar today
I was top masters before I stopped playing a bit ago and came back and was demoted to gold. That doesn't really bother me but the climb to masters is fucking brutal nowadays. I feel like its not unreasonable to ask that I can be promoted to masters before my MMR reaches GM level.
I would ditch the Pulse Laser personally. If you're good enough to hit with a Rail Gun effectively, I would toss another fixed weapon on your second fire group.  The Pulse Laser on the same fire group as your Beam is probably dragging your Beam down.  Do you run with full power to weapons when you're firing the Beam?  Also, if you want to make much less trips back for ammo, just try a 1 BL, 2 MC setup. Or, depending on how you fly, you can BnZ with 3 heavy thermal weapons. Rush in, dump all your weapon energy on the ship, fly out and recharge, repeat. If they start to jump, just use all your energy on a constant stream from your main Beam.
Very interesting and thorough answer. Thanks!
Woody has the same money clip, that's why I got it.
I'd hit it.
Sent you a Ditto. Enjoy

As well as some signings, we seriously need to get rid of many players as well. I have no idea how he would fit in currently, but more quality would never hurt!  We have too much deadwood currently. Assaidi, Coates, Alberto, Borini all should be leaving, so that we can further enhance our options.

Having votes for who the best users are... 
No. AKs are built to loose clearances, have lots of open space in the receiver, and are extremely overgassed. If you had a DI AK, it would be just as reliable as a traditional AK.  There are plenty of reliable DI rifles that have been used.
I sure hope he doesn't retire here. The islands too small to have every spot he decides to go to cordoned off plus the traffic his travel causes.
I am! And thank you! 
Vikings on the History Channel. Not the best show out of all the new stuff I watched this year, but god was it awesome.

i come from the future to thank you. its december 31 2014 and i just used this advice.
Ugh. No. 
I don't know the struggle as a never-in but my wife is exjw and I hate that caustic cult. I'm doing my part to spread the good news about their bad news and never shirk from confronting the mindless fucks at their little kiosks. In fact I just emailed my JW father in law an article about the world getting better and wished him a great 2015
Can somebody tell me what that jingle is from the guy's commercial at 1:20? I played the song in my high school band, but I have no idea what it's called.
The guy dropped a joint in his lap, not a cigarette.
week's worth of growth? not a problem *in the least.*

I'm spending my second ever nye alone. The first I spent alone my husband was deployed. This time I followed the rabbit too far down the hole of depression. Cleaning today has helped but I'm on the east coast and it's night now and night time is when I get scared. I had a rough road to this point but desperately don't want to go in to the new year still living in it. I'm trying to beat the monster but my family is 900 miles away at least and my friends are out of town so I'm here, on reddit eating a chicken pot pie because my thawed chicken breasts turned sour. Oh hi rabbit hole... bye rabbit hole.
neither, a crack head
*She nods a bit.* Thanks..
Woah....
At this point, you haven't told us what the ISIS demands are. Maybe if they are rational enough .. some or all of them might be met. If they are totally irrational as we can only assume, the world leaders give them the big finger and start shipping Muslim immigrants back to their home nations. 
Looks like you also lost about 15 years, looking young.
Thank you! I'll take a look at that.
The correct answer is clearly Jon's final DwD chapter.
Thanks, but I'm not sure where would I feed the lists I have so Python could generate a new one. But it really looks like what I want.
Why would you even post it if you're only going to describe it as crap you karma grubbing asshole 
I think I fixed the heat.
I believe they blacklist the phone if you keep it 
I never understood the attitude of cops to reprimand people.  Their job is to enforce the law, not warn you that they may enforce the law.  I understand they have lots of leeway, but they aren't our masters or parents.
Looking forward to her career in 2015 and beyond!
If you can max the game out then it is some nice eye candy, otherwise pass it up for now
We're getting brigaded by SRD and SRSSucks  Oh boy! 
31st of Dec or 1st of Jan? Happy birthday anyway :)
Thank you for this. I never thought I would be able to play Thomas was Alone ever
gallade
Ground-types absorb Livewire too.
I don't know either... Um... Kimchi maybe?
This is the gift that keeps on giving
Disagree, these should be valued at or around 100 dollars.  OP obviously didn't do amazing, but if he wanted the games in good shape, it looks like that was achieved

So?
Sony/Xbox. I built a gaming pc and bought a wii U for some exclusives. I couldn't be happier. All stupid 'le pc master race' crap aside it is much better for my situation. Consoles do have their advantages though.
[](/chaos01) I have gone into the future now! 
I don't know. I never saw it.
 I really don't know. I've never really thought about what my interaction with a comic character would be.
nice, hows Elisha?
I still don't understand why A2A Lock-ons are so popular. Noseguns+ AB is so much more dynamic and fun to play ) but a lot of people seem to care more about the end result/winning instead of the process/fight itself.
They will give us all 200 free gems then crash the servers so we can't use them.
For me, ESO was just GW2 with a different coat of paint. I think the way the world is partitioned and the lack of emphasis on multiplayer really hurts the game.
Are you new here?
Start training again. :( (Insert list of excuses here)
Yeah, I getcha. The processor is still nice, mine is essentially the same, but with a higher stock clock. Mine doesn't bottleneck in AC: Unity with a 970.
Don't bring me down man.
It sounds like your aim might be a little potato and you just don't want to admit it on 64-tick, whereas on 128-tick you have nothing to blame it on.
Huh, they use the brother's grimm version in Into the Woods, then.  I wonder if what happened to the step sisters was the same, too.  
agreed, plea hi rez 
Homer is the nice way of putting it. He's like 10x the Bowen.
Kathleen is banging every profession, from A to Z.
As a former admin for a server that has since died off, that sounds devilishly clever and somewhat disturbing, considering the connotations of a firing squad. Still, I like the reasoning.

Yep mid 30s here, going out with one of my good friends to get dinner, then we are heading to a party at a local bar. Plan to be up well past midnight. I go out so much more now than I did when I was in my 20s because now I have actual disposable income.
Oh noes. Release the hounds
I'm might not be back on until way later, you know doing fireworks and what not, if I don't get back on tell late can I get it tomorrow ?
Are they new to you and you've adjusted your game to them?
Nice going!  You're 3 days away from 300.  The next cool number for me was 333 days just because I thought it was a cool number. Then, a year!  You'll get there!

They didn't add a "White" option to the colors you can choose from. It would have been nice if they had taken into consideration lighter hair colors.
Just because Windows 2000 and Windows ME state that they are millennium editions does not make 2000 years a millennium.   Also, correct thing. 1000 years makes a millennium. 
There's a Big Boy at Steamtown? Holy crap, I have an in at that place.
Are they trying to say oliver will be back soon or will NOT??  EDIT: or does the return episode refers to oliver?
It's 15 TODAY.
There's a chance they're not all girls though.... :O   #Creepy50YearOldDudesOnlineWithHandsOnTheirDongPosingAsCuteGirls

Are mistweaver monks really good at the imperator and ko'ragh fights for HC? seems all the boss mechanics perfectly align with my personal mechanics.

"some neckbeards are posting mean things about me on reddit! some guy drove by my house! I'm the victim, not the girl I rolled into the shallow grave"
Yes, I believe you weren't indexed because you didn't have a character on the ladder
Yeah. My uncle. He didn't technically die this year, but my family just got closure on it a few months ago. If this thread blows up, I'd be willing to share more about it. Kinda crazy story. 
..yet.   http://youtu.be/cKznS61KipM
They're beautiful cats.   Are they all litter mates, or just the two orange cats?

I didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  I said 2.0 runs.  My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops).  And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.  Compared to 8:15 runs and 7:30 runs by fcmates, that's about three minutes.
If he's anything like me, it was totally worth it.
My thoughts too, looks quite nutty. But it's Japan.

Thank you! She is beautiful. I think black cats are good luck, to me anyhow.

I don't know what sort of universe you live in, but I know of nobody that has made that argument. But comparisons of Israel to Nazi Germany, attempts to designate Zionism as Racism, and the application of different different standards for Israel &amp; the rest of the world is all too common. The largest international body in the world is guilty of this. You can criticize Israel and nobody (well, maybe some guy on the Internet but nobody prominent) thinks that's antisemitic. 
My 2gb version of this card is around my friends 650ti, and could probably OC better. No idea on the 1gb though.
Mine arrived too. I admired the box for approximately 15 seconds before opening it (:
Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason:  #***Seal of Approval*** &gt;***Post Title:***  *A little justice*   &gt;***Top:***  *IDIOT WEAVING THROUGH TRAFFIC*   &gt;***Bottom:***  *SEE THEM DOWN THE ROAD PULLED OVER*  [Original Link^1](http://imgur.com/yP8u1ZC) | [Meme Template^2](http://imgur.com/memegen/create/yP8u1ZC)
I know sweetie, I know.
The greatest thing about this pic (if it is indeed Y2K shoppers), is the desperate look of concern on everybody's faces - that fear of the unknown.   You can just imagine the ill-informed conversations going on in that line of like-minded and scared people. How they were affirming and amplifying each others' impression of the situation. Any minute now, that guy in the center is gonna start jumping up and down making monkey sounds.
"Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have." - Thomas Hildern, Fallout: New Vegas.
Yes; we know. 
It's incredibly naive of you to think that the mother's going to pick *this* as the time to renounce the one, the only thing that can comfort her about the tragic death of her own child. She's not going to "respect" her son by having his death rob her of the only thing that will ever let her sleep at night again. She's going to respect him by defying the most savagely accurate versions of her superstitions, and you show a degenerate moral character by portraying this as some kind of aberration on her part. 
Your busy day is at an end...
The sound of chewing is my number one pet peeve. It drives me insane how many people just fucking open mouth chew into their mics :( Its like fingers on a chalkboard to me.
Maybe it was because the prank guy was being a nark and tattling loudly that he was smoking weed. 
Not sure how I missed this for two days, but thank you very much for the post!  It was truly a pleasure doing business with you.  I'm glad we were able to resolve it and know to look out for that going forward.  Hope you enjoy your package as much as you did the customer service!  Happy New Year!  -Chase
He absolutely has. He's not nearly as confident.

Well what do you want us to do? Send you starters or breedjects? That would defeat the purpose of a wonderlocke. Venting your situation on reddit isn't going to make a difference on what you receive. Just be patient and eventually you will get something.

&gt;Thankfully, there's a bit of a loophole and the one useful qualified withdrawal is for paying off student loans accrued within the same calendar year. So, I'm taking out the maximum in student loans and paying them off immediately, allowing me to use that money for things I need, like rent and groceries.  Is there a downside to this strategy? I'm interested in setting up a 529 and the random restrictions on what is qualified made me a bit weary about it.

The commute from Jets/Giants stadium to NYC is much shorter than the commute from NYC to Buffalo.  With mass transit, there are so many people living in NJ yet easily commuting to NYC every weekday.  NJ is a different state, but travel-wise it's a much easier journey.

Even though the findings presented here are Diametrically opposed to my values, they are pretty interesting. This changes nothing for those steaks in the freezer, though. Their fate is sealed. You can tell it's sealed because the little sealer thing turns blue
Yes, but it severely limits the results of the lawsuit.

Yep, all the infertility subs are just full of people that can't figure out how to bone properly. Lol. Actually, I was telling a friend about my journey and I realized that at no point ever in these past 6 years have I been asked by a medical professional if we were having vaginal sex. Can you imagine if that was the problem?! We died laughing at that. Infertile humor is so funny.

There is a difference between driving recklessly, and being unable to avoid a senior citizen who pulls out in front of you to take a left when you are responding to an emergency (someone whose life depends on how quickly you can get to them) with sirens blasting and lights flashing. When emergency vehicles are driving, you are supposed to get out of their way, not in their way.
It is charitable, but helping fund a football team (let's be realistic about where this money went) is not the same as helping cancer victims.

Not sure if it's my favorite game but the worst thing about the Mass Effect series is being unable to discuss it with any other fan of the game because of the ending (which I had very few problems with).

I'd say probably the 1969 Jets. The Colts just took them lightly but for the Jets it was their super bowl.

I mean I'm using a taped together HP laptop with a a completely broken screen until I get enough funds together, but if you're still giving away that 'console killer' I sure could use it. *Wink wink, Nudge nudge*
Hi, serialmc!
If a prisoner has no work, he'll treat "work" time just like freetime and return to his cell. Otherwise the two freetime slots double for shower. I've seen a lot of prisoners stay up during "sleep" and shower.
Could also be on his way out as the transfer window closes.  Lot of in and outs, lot of what-have-yous...
Absolutely gorgeous!
Melee: falco  Falco is straight up broken. He can shl you and control you the whole game. Getting shined once is as good as death. Once you are off the stage you just get spiked. He just has tools to shut down any approach and I hate it.
he wasn't good...
while we are at it, why no slot machine? seems like gud idea

Judging from his bottle, he's running out of delicious tears of the haters. So I think we might need another UHC winkwinknudgenudge.
A false equivalency.
I just want to learn. I want to go back to college. I have developed a serious thirst for knowledge in the last 4-5 years. I just want to continue learning new things and even step it up and really get some good education. I'm 28 so I don't know what to think about going back to the college atmosphere, I just know that I need to keep learning.

excuse me?
Wait staff is the last to notice inconsistencies in food at any restaurant.  In good restaurants they are trained not to serve what they know is wrong.  Also, the chef doesn't cook every meal in a restaurant. In fact he usually cooks the fewest meals to be served and is on the line less than the rest if the kitchen staff.
Alerts in 3 were easy, you could take out the lone guard before he radioed anyone.  If it worked like that it'd be a blast.
Yes in 7680x1440 I can get 100fps in the games I've tried so far. I've only got the extra 2 monitors a month ago, but so far I've ran Assetto Corsa, iRacing, Insurgency, starbound, Next Car Game, Dishonored, Civ5, Path of Exile, rFactor all fine. For AC I had mostly medium settings and 2xAA and was averaging around 130fps. I'm sure I couldn't run a lot of games on Ultra, though. AA seems to make the biggest impact, so only running 2xAA or FXAA makes a pretty big difference in some games.
That when I was a kid I was a weirdo and dumb. Maybe the reason I was bullied
Where are you?
Brock Lesnar. Hell there are plenty of Heavyweight amateur wrestlers, heavyweight mma fighters and pro wrestlers that are around the 300 lb mark and fit. And I think you are being downvoted for being kind of an ass. OP lost 100+lbs. That's fantastic, yet you comment how he is still overweight. Why not applaud the guy as he has clearly taken steps to make himself healthier and continues to do so.
If I had to guess, repetitive enemies and (at times) poor camera angles when facing larger enemies is probably a factor. Difficulty might also be off-putting for some.  That, and for some reason I've seen some judge it with all the expectations of a full-fledged $60 AAA title, and not a budget title.
So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams.  Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that? Surely at some point you'll want a better monitor (they're only about $120-130 for a high-quality IPS LED), and your hardware won't be able to keep up with it.  If your intention is to play video games on this PC, you're making a big mistake. I urge you to heed my advice on how to allocate your resources for better overall performance. You don't need to sacrifice a quad-core processor, just don't be getting the most expensive one of the bunch, it doesn't fit the rest of your specs.  Anyway... good luck.

I was going to do a write-up on the state of out of body shields like Frost's Globe, Eximus mobile Globe and the Nullifiers shields. These abilities on the enemy are in my opinion a great addition to the game. I've been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become. However, this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out. The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes. This means, explosive munitions I.e. Penta nades, Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players. Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it.   Another thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields. Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields (I've noticed this is only on Nullifiers) that slow high damage weapons. To put this into perspective, my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal ~800 damage to the nullifier shields. My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag, 5 shots (~9 shots with multishot) to take the shield down. DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable.  An idea I've been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs. Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself. By introducing this mechanic, Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons.   TL;DR 1) unify rules with regard to out of body shields. Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own.  2) Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers.  3) Add elemental weaknesses to the shields, bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void.

Sorry, why is it either or? Either the call was exactly as depicted, or a butt dial? I think this is what the OP means by certainty creep. If Nisha's testimony sounds fishy, then the next most likely scenario was that they talked about something else that night ("hey babe, how you doing?") rather than butt dial. They could have literally been talking about anything for two minutes, and it would neither exonerate Adnan or make him look guilty, all without invoking that idiotic butt dial.

I'd be inclined to buy it if they did. Hopefully the price won't be as expensive as it is now (base price is still $60!).  F2P would also be nice, but it would probably lead to worse design issues in the game. B2P may be a better revenue model. We'll see.

Dudepalbro - don't give up. Growing a beard is just like growing your hair out -BUT ON YOUR FACE. You know how awkward your hair looks as you grow it out? How androgynous, how absurd the transition can appear? But you just push through, right? A beard is EXACTLY the same. Most of us have to go through that nasty mangey face-pube stage before we level up. Sure it's gonna be patchy for a while. Yes, people are going to laugh. It's going to itch. You might pick up some unwanted friends in the form of face-crabs. Females will be (unusually, painfully) repulsed by you. It's all part of the journey. Just remember that some day, some glorious day - perhaps years from now - you'll look in the mirror and realize "I was late to the party on this fad and now I have to shave this shit off." And on that day, my (presumably) adolescent friend, you become a man. 
Yep yep, also checkout the audio messaging feature. You can use it like a walkie talkie
Because courts are biased towards women, and particularly biased towards mothers.  I understand it would be hard to search. Which is why I would change my view if even one example was provided, even if it was some blog post where they talked about how their sister was forced to pay for a child that she abandoned.   Or even a comment where someone said their mother gave them up at birth, but was still forced to pay child support.  God knows it's easy enough to find examples of those - when it comes to men.
Thanks! I've only just started drawing agai . Hopefully i'll be able to get to where I can put out awesome stuff like you.
/r/codcomp Waddup doe, SubHype here bka Devin.  I'm a 23 year old junior in college studying to become a software engineer while minoring in metaphysical philosophy at NIU.  My first COD, and first FPS game period actually was BO2. I know, I'm WAY late to the party but I followed that game very closely outside of competitive because it was new to me &amp; I'm too competitive to suck at something but not do something about it. Thanks to /u/Drift0r's in depth series I got a really good grasp on the how the game worked pretty quickly and am pretty much a stat junkie in every game I play now.  Ghosts was the first game I watched competitively, and I'm drained. I've watched 4 AW streams, just can't get into it like I was before :/  I'm actually a bigger Battlefield fan than COD &amp; I'm ironically a lot better at it too. I once ranked first in the state of Illinois in skill &amp; score per minute. I haven't played in months though so I'm sure my ranks have plummeted.  Outside of the FPS stuff I listen to a LOT of music (15 different genres and sub genres) &amp; watch sports constantly, my favorite being baseball (White Sox). That's pretty much me.
you and your wife are fucking awesome

Understandably it is going to take him a while to regain all the emotions and behaviors that life has and causes.  Bupe isn't a cure-all, he needs to be going to meetings at least twice a week if he really is committed to getting on a recovery path.  It sucks but you just might have to be patient for a bit until he gets used to living life on bupe, but I guarantee you that after a while he will return to normal and the bupe won't affect him in ways that full-agonists like Vicodin will.  Understand that he was on Vicodin for 21 years, it isn't going to be an overnight change.  That's a really fucking long time and it will be a while until he re-learns life.  Be supportive of him and congratulate him that he isn't being selfish, relationships are teamwork

Psychotic, disrespectful, out of control, spoiled, self entitled thug cops are acting exactly the way we should expect psychotic, disrespectful, out of control, spoiled, self entitled thug cops to act.  They don't respect the people and they don't respect their boss. That much is clear. Now is the most important time ever. Precedents have to be set one way or the other. Will their boss hold them accountable or do the monkeys now control the zoo?  Every single cop union over this country is watching. Every single mayor is watching. Who is in control?

First of all, thanks a bunch for the detailed response, I'm extremely glad to hear you liked my cards.  I deliberately made Arcane Unraveling do nothing in aggressive match-ups (although technically it could net value with Mad Scientist), because I think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue. All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control, but 5 additional cards, 5 turns when you're not taking fatigue, seems absolutely insane to me. Also, this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientist-esque effects into the game. I'd gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card, but I think against control it could be insanely useful.  I think Shadow Summoner doesn't produce an insane amount of burn at all; you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board (6 for the card, 2 for hero power, 1 for the Bomber), and you can only Hero Power once per turn. If you have pressure to go along with it, then yes, it will do work, but on its own I don't think it's that strong at all.  For Tinkerer, I imagined this card less as a Jeeves (who simply allows any class to be zoo) and more like a mini-Gazlowe. I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts (like a Gnome and Yeti) and you trade them in, this card gives you value. Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good, and you're not paying too much to get them.   Beastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously, allowing you to Houndmaster anything, enable Kill Command, etc. etc. This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster + Houndmaster, or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster; basically it allows a work-around for there being a low number of good beasts in the game. It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang, I don't know if that's enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think it's worth considering. And, the most important part for me, it is a vastly superior Black Knight + Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary; a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 6/3 and a 2/1.   Generator is insane if you can get value from it, but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange, which are pretty mediocre. And they won't get amazing value with the board state, except for Avenge; Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator, Noble Sacrifice won't be spectacular, and the other ones will be garbage as usual.  I'll agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong; do you think making it a 1/2 would be fine (still better than Creeper, but it is a class card)?  For the Tortoise, it does seem limited, but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw, or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws, playing 2/2s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game. A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 2/2 Taunts can snowball out of control. Also it's a Beast, though I don't know how useful that is.  I didn't consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all, I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker, when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher; you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once. Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well, although not by much. He's probably a much worse play in the early game, but I think when you can play him and a few health-buffing effects immediately he shines.  For Neighborhood Blacksmith, I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons, but then you can't use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have. And if you only get a few more charges, then he's pretty comparable to Greenskin;  with 1 minion, he's just worse, with 2 it's arguable (+1/+1 on the weapon but -2 Attack), so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin. Which for current Warrior decks isn't that easy to achieve.  Thanks again for the response!

the editing was OK, the plays were fine, but anyone who watches the LCS has seen all of them.  However the video it self was VERY predictable based off of the music, framing, and filters you put on each scene.  Ah, sad music and greyscale. C9 is going to lose this.  Ooh boy now the music was building up but suddenly stopped and the saturation has dropped. I sure hope it does't 'explode' into a big play while over-killing the saturation and blasting music. Darn.  Overall it was fine but felt like it was maybe your first time editing or you had watched too many kickstarter videos.

It's hard, but basically you have to be strong enough to at least 1v3. So, it isn't likely. If you're the ONLY fed person on your team, chances are you aren't gonna win. But the more often you get fed, the more often you'll win in the long run.

I remember when I started picking up things in the Steam sale: Tomb Raider, Max Payne 3, Skyrim, The Witcher 2 Enhanced, all for under £5. Some were even £2.50 or something.  Now I'm looking at half the AAA stuff (as above) sitting at £15+ and 'indie' titles like Shovel Knight for £7/8. It's hard to complain, but it still feels a little 'meh' when I've picked up premium titles with 10+ hours just for the main campaign, for half the price.  I mean, I think I picked up Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV, and Limbo for less than £2 each. I know the production values differ, but that is what the Steam sale always felt like to me. So cheap that you just buy things that *vaguely* interest you.

One interpretation is that the "mark of the beast" is actually the act of assigning numbers to humans, which hides their humanity from others. Asking "are these guys actually human?" is, in my opinion, a further inroad to dehumanizing others, based on their augmentation status.  So, in my opinion, those "Christians" opposing transhumanism in this way are doing precisely what they are claiming to be standing against.

FPOD really made Goldberg look like a chump. He was super over and a humongous draw at the time and they decided to hand the belt over to a stale Kevin Nash who dropped the title to an even staler Hogan.  The only real comparison that can really be made to WWE is that they repeatedly gave the title back to Hunter (and even Cena). Even so, I'm not so sure either of those guys did half as much politicking as Hogan did.   Hogan is the main reason for the death of WCW.

oh my goodness... that's so unfortunate. I did notice two days ago that you and iwhistle relapsed and I genuinely hoped we'd be killing it. Then I saw hechmaturgic now...  look. I'm eleven days in and I am *committed* but that does **not** mean that you can fucking give up on me.   &gt;We're failed except you.  you've only failed if you give up nofap. I'd like to post something that I posted on pornfree  "Well, I had been on a 7 day streak then I gave up. I was still motivated so I started again and went on a 22 day. Then I began doubting myself and what I was doing. I watched a few films in that streak and found myself enjoying scenes of sex *more* than usual. This caused it to snowball.  What helped immensely from that streak (my longest) is when an arousing thought hits you, **immediately** shut it down. Don't try to ignore it but rather tell it to fuck off and this next step is key to shutting it down: **move away from your previous room/activity** and do something else. If you disagree with the thought but don't move away, it'll be like a drug addict telling himself he's going to the store when he's actually heading towards a trap house/drug house. I know myself better than anybody else. I find it hard to really register others' feelings when they're trying to motivate me so I made a video where I convince myself in a time of need, to move on.   This is both to prevent procrastination and watching porn: I leave my phone across my room. Others choose to keep it across the house or in their safe but this is sufficient for me. I use an alarm and it forces me to stand up. Once I am up, I won't go back.   Lastly, reward and recognise your achievements! Make a vague reward plan. After a week of my new life, I will treat myself to a mcflurry. On the second, I'll get a subway sandwich. On the third, a cinema visit and fourth, a new trouser. Something like that   Never forget to reread your goals. **Never become complacent**.   I look forward to seeing our counters rise together as we create a new life for ourselves."  Oh and happy new year It is literally 00:00 as I type this.  I want to see you here next year at 365 days with me
If the impact doesn't kill you, there are resources to aid in survival. One of these resources is intense flight attendant training!

But it's like Sarah said in the last episode:  "There’s no point in trying to come up with a most likely scenario for what happened to Hae, because you could posit a hundred scenarios and so what? Bereft of more facts, better facts, even the soberest most likely scenario holds no more water than the most harebrained. In the equation of Adnan’s case, all speculation is equally speculative."

It really depends on how the US was defeated.  I'm guessing that, after a failed D-day, Germany took England, and stopped at the Atlantic, so they could focus on defeating the Russians. That was Germany's plan, after all  That would give America enough time to rebuild their army, and set up defensive fortifications on the east coast.   Also assuming the Pacific goes on as usual. 
I did just that because we have a young child and we didn't want him to have access to the basement, and there was not a good way to install a baby gate.

Check drsfosterandsmith.com. Purchases totalling more that $49 ship free, and they don't charge tax (at least for me, a californian).

Well I don't really think (correct me I'm wrong) that any of the other regions have a system like the Chinese region does with Perfect World, Valve seems to directly run/manage all of the other regions. That's why they get PW-exclusive items and stuff like this tournament. Regardless of the event being run by PW though, it should still be worldwide [since some non-Chinese teams are participating in the tournament] (http://www.dota2.com.cn/event/201411/dacs/).

Sony is lying to you, essentially. I have an older rear-projection LCD from Sony as well and it does not support HDCP. Most likely it's because in 2007 when the TV was made HDCP wasn't really a large consideration.

Secret millitary procedures probably. Personel with a sufficient rank should follow the instructions in section 4 of the red binder, that sort of thing.
Yes, Revelation.  Notice that before death and hell are thrown into the lake of fire, they are emptied of all souls for the day of judgement, and that by that point, all will worship God.  The scriptures are clear that by that time there will be no one who fits the description, and thus it describes a fate that no one suffers, because of grace.
Power Cosmic disagrees.
Any interest in selling the chanel powder? Edit: nevermind, I thought 3 translucent was the 30, but its 40, which is too dark :(
I am a bit shocked and disappointed by the poll results. I think the podcast has made it clear that the evidence against Adnan does not make a case beyond a shadow of a doubt. There is plenty of doubt. One might opine or speculate or intuit that he is guilty, but that is not enough to convict a man whom should be presumed innocent until guilt is proven.
Thank you for clarifying that. Up until a few months ago I had only played the games, but I realise now how expansive the halo universe is. I've been slowly reading about it all, and i have to say, I'm really intrigued by it all. I wouldn't mind reading some of the books, but I'm worried they will be half-hearted like nightfall. Any that you would recommend? Perhaps one that has a focus on the early humans and forerunners?

The wiki puts it at over 1.3 billion coins on the exchange. From a quick google, you can buy 100 million coins for US$276. So the hat is worth around $3588. In Australia, it would take around a month to earn that on minimum wage. So not bad, you could go on a decent holiday for that. But not exactly rockstar material.
It wasn't on Marrone, but on Schwartz. With that roster, the Bills definitely didn't live up to expectations.  I'm not too high on Fisher, but I can tell you he is better than Marrone.
Hey!  I get your point.  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused - this post was about tight rulesets, not about balance, but you seem to use those interchangably.  You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system, or a balanced system with not tight rules.  If it was about balance, well, warmachine/hordes is one system that supports 14 full factions, and warhammer 40k has 18 (really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions).  fantasy doesn't have to be balanced against 40k so it's not included.  So the difference isn't so great.  unless you think the jump from 14 to 16-18 factions really breaks the camels back there, but i cant see it.  But back to the tight ruleset -  warhammer 40k's main rules problem isn't the vast number of rules.  It's not the minute rules interactions.  Really the core problem is the rules aren't written in a systematic fashion.  A systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system.  40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time, and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing, leading to confusion.  40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english.  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule, then they write it down in the confines of the rules set.  To use an example earlier today - "a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point".  This is a poor rule as it stands, because the timing is not defined, and 40k doesn't even have a definition for what firing means.  do you "Fire" psychic shooting attacks?  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon?  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons?  A tighter defined rules set would have defined "fire" as making a ranged attack, and ranged attacks as psychic, shooting, etc.  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is.  To use an example from a comprehensive ruleset, in magic there's a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana.  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads "All blue lands produce an extra mana". That would be a terrible rule.  produce is not defined, it doesn't say when they make the extra mana (when they produce, do they produce two?  do they produce one now and one at the normal time?).  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording, you know this without even playtesting it.  Thats why magic words it "Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool"   The timing is defined, tap is a defined term in the rules, everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset.  Just reading through different games' rulesets, you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned. 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend, not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from.  It's not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules, it's the way they are written.
Damnit, I was working all day and didn't see this. Anything left? Any more contests for gpus or something?

Bonus, it's on sale on the PSN store right now.  They're also pushing content and balance patches. 2.1.2 patch is coming in January and a 2.2 patch is coming later this year. All free content patches from Blizzard that add new game modes and items to hunt for.  So even if you slow down, a new content patch will bring you back to the game.

I worked for a very large clothing company a few years ago and had this gem at my cash one day.   Ring through her stuff and ask if she wants a gift receipt (it is near holiday) she says yes. Pays, receipt prints, gift receipt prints. So I give her both and explain that the receipt without any prices on it is the gift receipt. She responds with "If there are no prices how do I know you arent ripping me off?" Uhhh what? So I point to the regular receipt that shows the numbers and say that copy is hers. She doesn't get it. Accuses me of cheating her somehow which triggers my "What the actual fuck" confused laugh- chain reaction of her getting mad and me laughing harder until she left

Yeah I've read everything except for shadows in flight and the prequel trilogy which is why i'm rereading everything now to put that in.  I'm sure I'll remember exactly who you'e talking about when I read it over again.
Trust me it's better to just watch the ~~hell's kitchen~~ kitchen nightmares episode then have it explained, but basically this woman and her husband refused to think that they cooked bad food and have bad service they even kicked a guy out and threaten to call the cops after he said he was leaving and didn't pay for the food he never even got after an hour and something of waiting.

Let us have our East Coast Reddit Riot.  Just let us have it. I feel like a few good days of non moderation on East Coast ping-rage won't do any irreversible damage to anyone, and would send the message we want sent.  I would **much** rather see threads about this than some more fan-art, as if we haven't seen enough. Make a megathread for that shit instead.
I'm annoyed and surprised. At this point in the year, I did expect the mavs to have picked up on rebounding... Fortunately, their lack of turnovers made up for those rebounds. 
You gotta keep 'em separated! *guitar riff*
There was a post a while ago about some guy who was showing off his kidney stone. Well, one picture was of him pulling the stone out of his wiener. The whole thread turned into everyone asking him what was wrong with his weird bent/squished/upside-down dick. I still laugh to this day when I think about it.

You can either tell the truth, *orrrr* do this:  One day let your wife "catch" you feeding cheez-its to your son.

When he doesn't vomit everywhere say he must not be alergic, maybe the old ones were bad or he out grew it or something.  You don't get in trouble, and your son isn't denied Cheez-its. You monster.

Our team this season was good, but our QB and coaches we're not. With Baker Mayfield at the helm next season I think we will be a 10 win team again, but only if our AD steps up and fires Mike Stoops and moves Huepel back to QB coach. I'd personally love to have Mangino back for either our defense *or* offense. We need some sort of staff change, but firing Bob would be a big mistake.

I really feel like this shouldn't all be put on the OP. The roommate should also be held accountable for leaving her puppy unattended. Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him.  I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. Should he help out with bills? Probably, yeah. But should he feel obligated to foot 100% of the expenses? I really don't think so.

If you want the whole dinner and dancing, then wait til the weekend. I was married on a thursday, and we kept it very low key. Ceremony was at 7, reception was at 7:30 in another room of the church. We did finger food, cake, and punch. Dad did a small toast, and that was it. Everyone was gone, and we were done cleaning the church by 10. Out of the 100 invites, 65-70 showed up. All out pictures were taken before the ceremony started to keep things moving.

&gt; You didn't say units of money changes uniformly, but that the prices must change uniformly these two are completely different things.   I did say that.  However, ignoring the fact that I said money units changed uniformly during inflation, how do you explain the ratio changes from a purely uniform denomination change?  This is left unexplained so far.  &gt;Inflation on its own causes prices to change because it increases the demand.   You need to explain this.  I don't agree that inflation increases the demand.  Can you prove it without an appeal to authority?  Please convince me with a rational argument if you can.

Well for downloading that is browser specific. For Chrome just go to settings, scroll down to advanced, and chose your download folder (E:\Downloads for me).   For installing programs I just manually choose when I install something. If I want it on C:, I leave it as default. If I want it on another drive, I just change the drive letter while leaving the rest of the path as default (E.g. E:\Program Files (x86)\...)  I have Steam/Origin/Uplay installed on C: but their download folders are on my HDD and I have a secondary SteamLibrary folder on my HDD also. 
I'll start us off I suppose, a fairly long time ago me and my boyfriend went to a swinger party where I had met a really nice girl. I've never really been into girl on girl sex, I find penis-less sex less than appealing, though I've only ever tried it myself once. Skip forward to when me and this girl, who I shall call 'Megan' in bed, I'd taken off her pants, and after rubbing the middle of her panties, found a rather peculiar shape from the inside. After pulling them down, *PLOP!* out came a penis.  I freaked out and ran to my boyfriend (Who was waiting in the living room), as if it was some kind of roach as I was a helpless school girl. A minute later or so Megan came out crying, deeply hurt by how I reacted.

I haven't paid too close attention this year. I'm doing a lot better financially, so I'm just picking up games I want as they come out at whatever day one discounts I can find.  That being said, looking at the steam store, almost every game that came out this year (before October) that I want is at least 40% off, the exception being Divinity: Original Sin at 33%.  I'd be a very happy camper if I could pick up Alien: Isolation at 50% off, Shadow of Mordor at 40% off, Dark Souls 2 at 66% and Wasteland 2 at 50% off.

"No organism is imaginary" is my point.  We assume homo sapiens do not want their lives ended unless they explicitly say so.  The reason people oppose abortion is because they believe the organism being aborted is a homo sapien, and if it is a homo sapien then abortion is murder, which is something libertarians oppose.  The reason people oppose abortion is not because God said it is bad.  Therefore, the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary - a belief either no one or practically no one has.  Even if people believed that abortion was wrong simply because God said it was wrong, then that still would not justify opposing laws against abortion because otherwise we would have to oppose laws against murder given there are people who support laws against murder due to God saying it is wrong.

I mean we've gone quite a while with very little to feed on in terms of hardware. People are getting anxious.

&gt;In The Communist Manifesto, Marx predicted imminent revolution in Europe. http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/marx-publishes-manifesto He also predicted it in advanced countries. Not only has this not happened, over 100 years later, but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries. The attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed. The Manifesto summarised their analysis: the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent  1848 was a year of revolutions in Europe. In 1871 the Paris commune was founded. The russian revolution started in Russia's industrial centers, Moscow and St Petersburg, and this is where Bolshevicks had support. In the country side other socialists were far more popular. At the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in Germany that is put down by SPD, at the time an officialy marxist party.  Marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world (there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6% of the vote followed by "Red Scares", see Eugene Debbs or read the Grapes of Wrath for a closer look at that era) and it then got mixed with the anti-colonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies based on agriculture.  But it's wrong to say that it applies on feudalism. Even today with communist parties far weaker in general you see them getting strong in industrial centers in a number of european countries.

Its the same girl, apart of me wants to move on and another part of me can't. The reason I can't mainly is because she will not admit that she lied in the beginning. She's really breaking my trust with this whole thing. That action is just saying I'm watching my own back before you. I will not use this info in court (it would be silly to bring up), its more of a personal thing. and thank you. It really means a lot that you are taking your time and replying. And congrats with your life! :)
Aw I like your face! You look like a sweet guy.  I would date the fuck out of you.   Also congratulations on the weight loss, you must feel great! Looking good! :)
Was Destiny originally planned for 360 and PS3? It seems like creating the game for an 'equal' experience across all consoles led to some limitations.
So it did or did not happen? If the quote happened, it fucking happened.
I think the people who would understand that would be the people who already knew how the tax system worked. I think you were right to rely more on the explanation.
Oh I know, it's a ridiculously big project. It's something I'm personally quite interested in though and it's definitely on the list of things I'd like to eventually do if/when I have enough time to work on something for long enough that it's worth for other people to chip in, if that makes sense. Cockatrice being in C++ makes it a lot more attracting to me than XMage's Java.  Thanks for the work on Cockatrice by the way!
Works for me. Try it out. If it doesn't work for you, maybe try a little harder? You really gonna set up a soldering iron when a all you need is a pen or pencil? Also, smaller hole == tighter/snugger fit.  hehe.
Oh I really hope they aren't.  I'm an Alabama fan so I'm really hoping we don't pull an Ole Miss tomorrow.
EF0 = "Dust Devil" around these parts 
...which isn't due to the modern invention of socialist medicine 
WOOT!!! Keep it up bro!
Jimmy Butler isn't a star yet. I still need to see a few more months.
It's only 50 gold 
 LAAAAAAAAAAFD
Sorry I was slow to post, just got scammed by him an hour ago
All those free seats. Wow thats just sad.
Same as last year: Drink more water and get better at dancing. 
It's like the Pay to Play version of life.
Congrats! I joined this meetup group: http://www.meetup.com/Squash-Singapore/ and sometimes I play with my cca-mates. 
I feel like I have to, so....  Who is your favorite stand up comedian?
Better smoke flippantly then.
I get that, but it was so quick (and filled with other games too) that I barely knew which side each game was on. 10 games in just over 5 minutes is very quick
Looks really good. Keep it up.  Opinion time - Work on faces.  Not saying it's bad, again just my opinion.  It just looks a bit off compared to the rest of the style i guess.  It looks out of place and the last thing in the scene to be drawn.
I believe [Mod Organizer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1334/?) supports Fallout 3. Install MO onto the hard drive and all of the Mods should be stored there.
Lol
Oh My Want!
Do you eat the gristle?
Naw, it's just a .magic file somewhere in the home directory because the programmer was lazy.
[I see what you did there!](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/i-see-what-you-did-there.png)
It isn't raining currently. I sure hope it doesn't rain tomorrow!
EL AY EM OH!
Idk if its sweat or what that fucks the pad for me, cuz theres like 1 lovely spot and i keep playing dm and comp for a couple of hours and the friction just changes, maybe i should try a hard or a hybridbpad.
Claim all you like, take your ego with you while you're at it. 
My bad, sorry.
I thought everyone knew that. 
Yes and yes and yes!  Just got mine today and it is everything I had hoped.
:(
did that person play in Waterboy?
How the hell can you shave in a car? You're making shit up. 
[Polyloquent](http://i.imgur.com/ZvtmaMC.jpg). Dip pens are fun. Now if only I could use them better...
Nice. Very nice.
or run up to him and screm, "SKI-U-MAH!"
Wow. Hey, regardless of why, it's still awesome bro. Be sure to say thanks to that person if you haven't already! And congrats on the amazing progress you've made!
Bacon is white meat. 
Very bizarre as the system was bought new from Best Buy and I've been using it up until today without games appearing.   Oh well!
THANKS FOR THE OFFER BUT NO THANK YOU.
&gt;Yes, simply changing a name does nothing. But, the difference between an opt-in and opt-out system is very real and meaningful. It is not just a different name, but an actual difference in outcome and practice.  Well, explain to me the differences in results then, because you haven't done so as of yet.  &gt;I am not sure what you are saying exactly.  You're saying that his post is wrong and is dismantled by switching to an opt-in system. However, the solutions to the questions that he asked have nothing to do with an opt-in system. In fact, they have to do with a system which actively compels everyone else to pick up the tab.   &gt;This is a very poor argument. Someone who is sterilized may not want to pay taxes that give subsidies for families (someone else's child), yet they are forced to.  That's my point. You're arguing that forcing someone to pay for the child is wrong in one circumstance, but totally fine in another. The sterilized person hasn't opted-in to paying for the child, so, as per your framework, they shouldn't be forced to pay it.
I am, lvl 31 hunter S O G HIH
*I yawn*  I completely agree.
He hella ded
Are plants really not alive...?
[Alpha Beta Soup Episode Φ: Combination Christmas Special / Farewell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdcgUgON79A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLPJ7kX3lAvXGnBF6Two07PkE8zSvRGUp2)  Mildly NSFW.  In the grand finale of Alpha Beta Soup, we discuss Christmas, the new year, and for the first time ever, we unveil a new videogame pre-alpha live on the show.  We also make jokes about the mentally disabled and Shrek. Really original stuff, here.
You have a Robbie Robot!
I remember seeing a reply from a Dev once about light reflecting off of interstellar bodies, that they hadn't added that yet.  Light from the surface? That's another level. I would imagine that this wouldn't be added until they enabled PG of planetary surfaces. Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me like they won't turn it on until they build it from the ground up.
I used gpu-z to tell me the details. By the Bus Interface, it said PCI-E 2.0 X16 X2. The X2 meant that it was only running the gpu through the motherboard with the bus speed of PCI-E x2 severely bottle-necking my performance. I couldn't find any way of fixing this in the bios, so I changed pci-e slots for the gpu and bam, now it reads PCI-E 2.0 X16 X16 and I'm getting MUCH better performance in games. Wolfenstein the new order would drag all the way down to 15 fps on a gtx 980. Now I get a consistent 60fps.  
Gilmore girls? No. Richie rich's dad. 
It's fine dude. :)  TLDR: by going 1 mph slower than I suaully drive 11 hours a day I lose $250 per month.   We don't do it because we're trying to save fuel. It's to get ahead of the driver plain and simple.  The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars don't get held up from us passing.  First off, fuck anyone who says that. It's fucking selfish.  If I'm going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph I'm going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car can't wait a minute while I pass someone.  If the guy I'm passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles. If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year that's 183,000+ miles per year that he's doing.  Now I come along doing 65mph. Which using the same math I cover 2,000 more miles a year than him.   On a typical day with my current outfit I make about $250 per day doing about 350 miles. So since I'm covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means I'm losing $250 per month.  Now he doesn't directly cause this loss of income because he's just trucking along minding his own business. But I'm losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go.  So regardless if someone is approaching I'll swing around him, get back up to speed, pass him and then move back over. And then you can go by no problem.  Additionally, I don't want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass. Anyone can agree with that.   If you made it this far then that's good. Haha  A Truck driver is on the road for weeks at a time. We deal with every kind of driver. Some are kind and considerate. Some are giant dicks almost accidents. Most are inconsiderate pricks who think that their time is more precious than mine.  We're all out here trying to make money and get somewhere safe.   Thanks for reading. Be safe today. People are nuts on holidays on the roads. :)
Now I'm stuck between the SCAR and AR. At long range, which would be better?
To be fair, I think their adenosine, thymine and cytosine guise as well.
Oh Christ that living room. 
:)

The asssemblers themselves don't share resources, only resources in containers or directly from the refinery are shared. You probably don't have enough ingots to fill up both of your assemblers.
but those animals were bred and exist for the sole purpose of being eaten. Do you want the animal's life and death to be meaningless?
Don't worry. Being not a doctor on tumblr makes your diagnosis more valid. 
I thought we were gone for a few seconds there lol. But I'm definitely loving this car
1. Still against it.  2. Still against it. By the way, you broke his arm. I went to the hospital and fixed it. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  3. Whatever.
This is awesome
Thanks. I can finally move on to the next. Just debating which method to take
