I read about ISIS capturing Yazidi women and selling them as sex slaves, citing Koranic justification.  Because they aren't Muslims and they were captured in war, is that how it should go?

Isn't parma more of a recent hipster/Melbourne thing than ubiquitous Australiana? I mean it's been around forever, but it's only recently become a 'thing' that people talk about and covet. Right?
I didn't work Governor's Ball, but yeah it's one thing to be a "rain or shine" event but there's a safety factor too.   It was less of a medical call then last time too, but during the evacuation it got worse. Everyone sliding on the mud and running. It was insane.   We were warned a few hours before it happened too, and I told some people by me to be aware that they might need to leave because of weather. Some were understanding, but a lot of people were very unreasonable and violent about leaving. Security has been getting the shit end of the deal with EZoo. We only follow direction and enforce rules and safety. "Fuck EZoo security" gets on my nerve because we aren't with the event itself, we're an outside company.  Can't win them all.

You know, this account is in the 1 year club, the account I used before this one was a couple years old when I made this one, so I've been a Redditor for at least 3 years now, and the old account was subbed to it idk how long ago, but figure about 3 years, and we were talking about doing the tournament the year after I joined...  So no.. idt so..  Every once in a while though, roflmoo makes a post about the list, so idk. I hope so.

Ursa is reasonable in white green for his role as a protector, and doublestrike is generally white/red, so i said it could stay w/g. meepo is also not exqctly cruel or evil, just self(group?)serving, which is fine in red. Legion is also fine in red white. Centaurs are also part green, so its also not a big deal. Omniknight is also red because the whole fanatical zealotry thing that works in red. Redirecting damage could be mono white, ala harms way. Either way is fine.
The problem with rain is that the Lidar's laser reflects off the surface of puddles or wet roads and keep going forward instead of getting bounced back to the sensor. So the vehicle can't actually "see" anything that's wet.
It kinda sounds like you might have a finicky metal allergy coupled with the fact that your ears probably were already irritated from having been pierced with guns previously. Maybe try titanium next time if you do, since its hypoallergenic so they contain no nickel or lead. I'm going to go out on a limb and say the CBR's you got were most likely 316L or 316LVM stainless steel which still have nickel in them (albeit a very low %, but if you are already super sensitive it doesnt matter).  If you do end up putting anything back in them I recommend titanium or Teflon (PTFE). Ask your piercer if these options are available.   As for your stretched lobes... I seriously could not tell you. The only thing I could think of is if you had been wearing steel jewelry, its possible they might have been acting as weights. Its not likely to happen but it does happen. The best advice I can give you is to go back to your piercer and explain the situation so they can troubleshoot with you in person and also be able to take a look at how your ears are doing.  Good luck!  Edit: Also what were you using as aftercare?
you might want to change that "I've" to an "I'll". Might cool off some of the pms

&gt; Except that Canada and Mexico are extremely weak states.  By the end of world of war Canada had a million men at arms, the 4th largest air force and the 5th largest surface fleet in the world.   &gt; They have literally no other option.  Your narrative is very peculiar to me and it makes no sense at all.   The USA joined the Allies in 1941 because they were attacked by Japan. It wasn't Canada who aligned themselves to the USA "because they were extremely weak". US and Canada share the same values, which is why they've always been allies. The UK and Canada and the US share a bond as English speakers, and have been allied in one way or another since the 19th century. Britain and France were also allied - also neighbours. There is no hint at all in the Western democracies that they'd immediately turn to communism without the US to guide them. There is a tradition for democracy, judeo-christian values and common language for some. That's why they're aligned.  [We don't live in a game.

Budget surpluses are not the be-all and end-all of economic management, and it's to the eternal detriment of this country that the two are so regularly conflated.  There are times when being in surplus is the wrong thing to do economically.  There are times when it is the right thing to do.  And then there are times when it happens more or less by default (and times where it can't be achieved) regardless of the actions of the government of the day.
I do.  I've been thinking about helping with making the Saki route a reality like that one guy in here wanted to do.

#1  Arachne is queen of the jungle, and is the only god that is described as a great jungle by Hirez, so you know it's legit.  The rest of the classes go as followed:  Xbalanque is the top ADC.  Cabrakan is now currently the top support.  Odin is the top warrior.  Ohh and mages suck, so don't even both with them.  #2  Buy meditation on every god.  It is really really OP! #3 If you are playing support, it is your job to last hit as many things as possible to ensure you get fed.  Especially gods, as they give the best money and xp.  You need the money, because you are the supporting pillar for the whole team.  The others on the team can suffice with assists, which are nearly just as good.  #4 Wards are overrated.  They are a total crutch for noobs.  Don't start off relying on them, and you will learn to walk on your own two feet.  #5 Attack the objectives as much as possible.  Kill someone in your lane?  Call for everyone to atk the fire giant!  9 times out of 10 the other team is too busy harassing the noob that died to even worry about whether you are attacking an objective.

Well no. A motivational video maybe but the video couldn't be used to *recruit* since there's no mention of ISIS or a call for the fight of the muslims or something.   Think about it, would a video of some arabs doing fucked up shit could be called an US army recruitment video if it's nothing but arabs doing fucked up shit? Maybe it will make you angry at arabs in general but it wont make you feel like signing for the US army (unless you hate them a whole fucking lot).  Now if you have a video of a Marine with all his gear shooting his big rifle, then you see an helicopter blowing shit up and finally you see a glorious Navy ship cruising the sea with its thousands canons, that might make you want to sign up. That is a recruitment video. Then, once you're in, you are shown the video of the arab doing fucked up shit for motivational purposes and bingo!  Okay, maybe im over-thinking this joke a bit...

What's not to like? You can't hate everything! This game is going to be so much fun!

I'm not saying he's an average human.   However, Aang is more closely related to being a human while Grimmjow is more close to being a god like being.   Although Aang is powerful in his universe, he's not much compare to the beings in the bleachverse.   Grimmjow will easily out level Aang in strength/speed.

It's likely you've got some sexual frustration stored up in your body. A good massage will release all the stress and emotions that you store up physically in your muscles. Some people cry while getting a massage, not because anything hurts or there's anything wrong at the time; it's just been stored up as tension in your back and shoulders, or wherever it is you store stress.  All that said, I'm no expert, and I'm just repeating what I've been told by a friend who is a masseuse.

Speaking of dudebros pretending to be oppressed...
Oh wow... I had my headphones in the audio jack... It's a right angle connector so It's hard to notice on the black desk.... I feel soo stupid. 
&gt;you should apply for a job at the front office, obviously you have access to the win-button seriously, afterwards its easy to call out any decisions being made  Some decisions are easy to call out before they are made.  For example. Tavon Wilson.  Another example. Garappolo's contract runs out in 4 years. brady's runs out in 4 years. You can't cut Brady because of dead money. So essentially you will have to pay Garappolo before he actually proves anything.   &gt;from what i've read, you didnt provide any solutions, did you? even if you did, it would be pointless, cause there is nothing to prove AFTERWARDS  Just because I can't prove that anything I will do will work out doesn't mean I can't call out somebody for doing stupid things. Plenty of people criticize Obama. Do they think they can do his job better?  &gt;esides, your looking at that VERY one-dimensional the pats relied on their offense for years they now adressed that big time in FA...extactly what you demanded  They got Lafell. And overpaid for Edelman when they have Amendola. Yup. I'm impressed.   As for defense, getting revis now doesn't excuse the last 15 years. The squads that won the sbs were the ones that Parcells and to a smaller extent Carroll built.  &gt;in case you still didnt get it, offense wins game, defense wins championship...look at the broncos, all their offense was useless at the SB  Just because the Seahawks beat the Broncos and the Giants beat the pats doesn't mean defense wins championships. The seahawks btw average the second highest points per drive last year only behind denver.   Look at the 49ers dynasty, the Cowboys dynasty, the pats in 04, the broncos when they won, the saints, the colts, the ravens when they got hot in the playoffs.   &gt;so cause we didnt surround brady with twelve dozen future HOFs (which exactly, btw? and which exactly the past year? wallace? rofl) its another wasted year?  When you put your hof QB in a position where his best target is Reche Caldwell or Julian Edelman you aren't doing a good job at all.   &gt;PS: hernandez was great while he played, right? god, i should stop going over that moot points  I have no problem with hernandez being drafted where he was. What I have a problem with is hernandez getting a guaranteed contract with a lot of guaranteed money and no behaviour clause in his rookie contract. 
And for me, after playing 3.5 for 6 years, it felt wrong - I stopped playing D&amp;D entirely more than a year before 4e was even announced. Then 4e came out, and it was so, so right...finally a system that got out of my way and let me tell the stories I'd been wanting to tell.  But then, some people really like mint ice cream, and I think mint is one of the most horrible flavors on the planet. To each their own.
I was trying to walk you through basic problem solving steps.  In most of these types of problems, the solution ends up being trivial with a bit of googling.  That you've been working on it for 3 days tells me something is off with the way you are going about it - its not an excel issue and its not a VBA issue.  In short, you're probably trying to google the Excel version of ["How to Draw an Owl"](http://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) and becoming frustrated because things don't work that way.  If you could describe it step by step in English, I can almost guarantee that you could google each step and get an answer that you could put together yourself and it would have gone a long way to enabling you to solve your own problems.  You know, give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish.  For example, how do you copy the contents of a workbook?  You open it, copy what you want, and close it.  Literally the entirety of what you want to do can be boiled down that simply.  Your response to my attempt to help was rather snide and you completely ignored the advice given.  You've not once that I've seen this entire thread asked a *specific* question or anything beyond "How do I solve my entire problem all at once".  We often lack the context to do that, and it takes round after round after round of revision, often with the person on the other end of things just doing the needed copy pasta until they get something that works.  I don't really have any idea what you *expect* given the nature of the question.  Maybe you should take your own advice.
You can fade our flairs, but you can never fade OUR FREEDOM!! 
It's cool. I've never seen it.
That's a good idea! I might have to consider that.

My first phone too. It was paid for by the boss so he could contact me for IT support out of my working hours, when the office was working 8am to 8pm. I could send SMS so I guess he paid extra for that.  The best part was that the crappy one2one reception in my town meant that it didn't work when I went to the pub.   I went to the pub a lot.

Couldn't agree more. I said in another thread, thinking that we could get anything more than a 6th round pick for a guy who has thrown 4 passes in the regular season and has seriously underwhelmed in the preseason is delusional. Matt Flynn at least had ONE really good game with the Packets before he got paid and look at what happened to him. I don't think any reasonable team is going to take the risk on someone who hasn't proven anything. 
My friend had no problem getting a support type job there in Antarctica. I think they focus on demonstrably responsible people who are free to spend 5 months there. But yeah with your eyesight issue there are surely better options. I wish you well in your plans.

He really isn't. Using him as one was pure make-believe. His game on defense and moving the ball between the defenders and the rest of the team is his strong suit.
Agreed.  Most people will gawk at the idea of paying $400 for a blender today.  I was one of those people until my wife finally convinced me to buy a blendtec (okay, let's face it, [Will It Blend?](https://www.youtube.com/user/Blendtec/videos) is what really sold me).  I fully expect to be able to pass this thing down to my kids or grand kids, should they want it. 
I would like that much better. It would feel more like a real storyline and not just a showcase of the near-immortal powers that Sam and Dean now possess, like no enemy can stand a chance against them anymore. Dean goes in alone, explores, fight the monsters as they come, expresses *real fear* (that would be neat to see from Dean again), saves Sam, and then gets the hell out. 
You get what Im saying.

My heart goes out to this kid. I couldn't imagine living with a parent like that day in and day out. I hope this video gaining attention will lead to someone intervening and removing the kid from that toxic situation.  On a side note, why is everyone on reddit so obsessed with (rudely) correcting grammar? It's an understandable mistake and it's easy enough to comprehend what the OP means. I mean, who knows, some of the people you correct may not speak English as their first language but speak several different languages, while you only speak one but feel the need to act superior.

I can't go into details but I was effectively put in harms way by the Garda in an effort to bring someone else to justice. My health and safety were considered secondary to them solving their local vendetta against an individual. My faith in the establishment was severely injured that day. I also grew up in a low-income estate, and anyone who has lived in any estate like it knows exactly how much of a problem (rather than a help) the Garda can be due to their professionally internalized bias towards dealing with individuals from such areas. I've largely considered myself to be at the mercy of local criminality, and have never been made to feel safe by them.
Is it different in the UK than in the US?!  Here, many of the poor have bad diets BECAUSE they buy food that is more expensive but less healthy.  I was stretching my pennies for several years.  A diet of whole wheat bread, peanut butter, beans, a bag of apples, some random vegetables, and cheap meat in smallish quantities was my usual menu.  This is WAY cheaper, yet WAY healthier than anything ready-made or in the junk food aisle full of stuff marketed to kids. Is the problem that grocery stores are not in the slums in the UK, so that it's a several pound/dollar trip to get to the food?  Are they drunk/high, so that food comes from the nearest quickie mart's junk food section?  Do British taxes make everything too expensive whatever you choose?  If this was written by competent journalists, who would be at fault for real here?
I met his dad too, around 1990-91 when he still wrestling in England, at a show in my home town of Northampton. My dad had a pint with him as it happens. I was ten, so my memory's a bit hazy, but he seemed like a normal-albeit very big-bloke. Not, as my kid-self saw it, like a 'big mean wrestler' like he was supposed to be, but just another regular bloke my Dad happened to be chatting with. Yes, Dynamite Kid was there, but unfortunately I didn't speak to either of them other than to get a handshake from Davey Boy, but I remember how 'normal' and everyday he seemed, sort of like a little realisation that they are real people not superheroes. Dad said he was friendly but sounded tired, which is understandable. Sorry for rambling on, your comment just inspired a little nostalgia there!
I wish there weren't as many characters as there are, I'd like to see the ones we have developed a lot more.   Like...we still have no idea when Heiji's birthday is. Plus I'd like to see some stories with Kazuha where Heiji isn't involved. Maybe some stories with just the two of them. I'm biased towards the Osaka duo. 
I agree. I've been playing for six years and recently got serious about it and am taking lessons. I've gone way beyond I-IV-V folk strumming and am learning music theory now. My teacher has been playing for over 45 years.
My hubby hasn't done anything like that thank goodness :P He gets a little stressed when he can't calm my crying down. poor guy 
I didn't try per se, but I was so close and knew that if I did start, I'd succeed. Anyway... The last two years have been the worst of my life. About 10 months ago or so, I just gave up on everything. I came home every day tired and completely out of my mind. I was at the end of my rope. I was sleep deprived since I just couldn't sleep, which just made things much worse. One week, I spent every minute of every night thinking about killing myself, how that would be a relief, and how I'd stop being a burden to everyone. I didn't really have anyone that I could talk to since I really had one friend at that point, and she lived across the country. Then, one night, I decided that this was it. Before, I always thought that I'd write notes/letters/whatever to a few people, but that night, I couldn't bear being alive for any second longer than I had to be. I said, "Fuck it," and I grabbed a knife. I put it against my carotid artery. I took a breath and started to press down pretty hard. I suddenly had an epiphany and stopped. The only reason was that I hated myself and my life so much. It sounds contradictory, but I wanted myself to suffer since, well, I hated myself so much. It's kind of a weird loop thing. I broke down, and I laid in my bed for the rest of the night.  My friend kept begging me to get help for months and months before that, and I finally did that since I realized I wouldn't finish out 2013 if I didn't. I'm in a better place now (yay...), but I'm still depressed, some nights much more than others.
LMQ making it to worlds just proves that it works.

Highjacking this to link to the current "optimal" 450$ gaming build. http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2d5q94/build_complete_the_450_dualcore_game_slayer/  The GPU is about the same as PS4/Xbone's and even though the CPU has 2 Cores, they are much stronger than the 8 cores of the AMD CPUs in the consoles, which only run at 1.6 GHz. This is a fantastic deal but the insanely good performance/price ratios don't appear until slightly higher price points.

I would get an R9 280x over the 770, it is cheaper and performs a little bit better in general.  Also in this price range you really should be including an SSD, only [$73](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/crucial-internal-hard-drive-ct128mx100ssd1). it will make a significant performance difference in general use. Otherwise seems like a good build.  fyi 16gb ram is overkill for gaming purposes so unless you do rendering / professional work you can stick with 1 8gb stick and add another one later.
That's the ice one right? Would you take a shiny rotom for it?
Exactly my thought on this.   This guy way over paid for basically a few games and 3 systems.  Do any of the systems work?  This is exactly why people ask 700 bucks for an NES with 30 games anymore.   I can't wait until this fad cools down.

When I want crispy kale, I dry, lightly oil, and bake it in the oven with salt &amp; sometimes spices. Look for "kale chips" recipes. I'm afraid I can't help you with the problem of texture in sauteed kale; I never cook it that way. Steaming it with a cover on will certainly thoroughly cook it (that's the other way I do it), but that will not yield a crisp product. You'll get something along the lines of cooked spinach, only tougher.
Today you will also learn that the plural of species is species.

Ok. People like you say shit like that since the days of Quantic and then CLG Loco/CLG Seraph.

I had a lot of success with extra zinc as well prior to going on BC...but, to be fair, my diet was awful (chronic undereating, severely underweight and mildly anemic to boot) and whenever I'm not well, my skin is the first thing to start going crazy.   I'm not really sure how taking zinc internally works for skin, but IIRC it assists in the function of the immune system.

No, of course not! It's like Gambit, they barely speak english too.   It just irks me that a team of 100% foreigners can represent a region they just arrived in, without as much as adopting the used language of the region.   It will not be good for the future of either NA or EU if Korean/Chinese Challenger teams decide that they're easier ways to Worlds, and we end up with multiple teams that are only there to climb easier.

I'm entirely new to the game and starting from scratch with 1.3.   It's good to know that opinion is mixed about the difficulty, because so far I've unlocked one hat and made it to sector 5 once. It sounds like I'll have trouble when I eventually get to the last level, but I'm fine with that.

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.   2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.   3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.   4 But even with all that light, the still cops wouldn't see the truth for what it was.   5 However, before there were cops there were dinosaurs.

Walking and crouching are the most useful things you can do to rapidly control your accuracy and burst control, in ALL guns. AWP? When aiming slow down faster by walking till you stop, hold it SHIFT till you stop without moving, accuracy 100%. AK first shot when staying still is 100% accurate, m4a1-s is a close 2nd in still accuracy. There is a spray pattern, most noticeable on ak, negevs, and PP-Bizons. Never, NEVER, aim above the head, Trying to headshot with ak, staying still (using the same walking method with the AWP), can insta head shot with 100% accuracy. Hit him in the head, and still alive? wait 1-2 full seconds until your next well placed shot. 
the worst thing about 16:10 monitors is that they make you bitter and angry over 16:9 being the "standard"  
Like OP says it's mostly in common usage when attached to online erotica or adult fanfiction.  That's because those genres often contain fantasy and sci-fi scenarios like Love Spells, Sex Pollen, Vampire Pheromones and Aliens Made Them Do It. The authors want readers to be able to distinguish between a story where character A is brutally raped by character B and a story where A and B have mutually satisfactory sex which they don't regret afterwards, but which they probably wouldn't have had if they hadn't been exposed to the spores from that alien plant in chapter 2.  I think it's a more helpful distinction to draw regarding fiction than real life.
Different halves means different physics pulling on each side of the core, tilting will always be an issue.  Surprisingly it doesn't cause that  much vibe from my experience.  The 3 OD benhmarks are probably amongst the less problematic baped as they have the same weight. But that's just a theory.
knife kills are so satisfying in game  nice video dude
Hi, I'm totally OP and I would like those games.
Thank you :)

I've been to the desert outside of Burning Man season. it's a desert. trust me, it survives. there was no trace of humanity outside of the government sign and some tire tracks.
Its just the human body in its natural state, whats your problem?
Eh, just pretend the final minute didn't happen (Which it didn't in the VN apparently) and you'll be fine.
Thank you for glamming. :)

True dat. I never understood everyone asking you to make passwords such as "n9f2Kfj". It's easier to brute force that then say "thisPasswordIsLongBecauseEveryLetterAddedToItMakesTheTimeFactorLargerForA-ComputerBasedBruteForce""
Our program is adopting it starting this fall.   1-stripe= Private 2-stripes= Instrument 3-stripes= commercial  4-stripes= CFI  There is also an informal polo shirt available. If you get hired by the flight school, you wear 3-stripes as a CFI

I trust 2 sources for video game reviews.  1) My friends, since they already know what I like, and can judge if I'll like a release accordingly.  One of my friends in particular is so freaking good at sending me links to Steam games I enjoy  2) The user section of Metacritic.  People who aren't paid to review games give the best reviews of games  I see sites like IGN and Gamespot to be entertainment sites, not informational sites.  Lets be honest here - most of the reviewers don't even finish the games they review, can't give scores that are lower than 7 or higher than 9, and don't have appropriate resources or time to judge the limits of how good a game is.  They don't have my personal tastes, they can't properly assess game difficulty because they don't have time to focus on learning mechanics, and they have to worry about truly trashing a game lest they get fired.  There are some Youtube personalities that have gotten very popular for game synopses and reviews.  An actual "game journalism" site can aspire to be that effective, at best.

Doesn't seem like I was the only person with the conclusion that you are not handling this situation properly. Have you tried calling any of the rsvp's that haven't responded? It could be you need to make other arrangement for a party and wedding if it doesn't fit into other peoples' schedules.  I had a coworker who had the same problem. She ended up with a wedding of close family and a weekend camp out and BBQ for everyone else who wanted a party.
Honestly? Since you asked.  No, it didn't.  I felt a far greater sense of wonder and appreciation for the divinity of creation coming from the Dalek than I did from Capaldi. Capaldi is having real issues with emotional clipping (like in a digital photo of a scene where the range between light and dark is too great).  Other times his "color balance" seems to be way off.  Somethings he is just doing a poor job of presenting.
D'oh.  Oh well.

Great! Thanks a ton this was super helpful.

You are looking at this the wrong way, the issue isn't that the Big Ten is scared of losing games to FCS, but for every game that an FCS beats an FBS, there are three games where an FBS beats an FCS by 40+ points.  That is the underlying problem
Having goofy fun with a good friend in either of the recent SR games is always a good time. 
Oh and I loved the Foundation series when I was a kid. I went back and re-read it a few years ago and... now, not so much. I think Psychohistory is conceptually a great idea, but I felt like the characters weren't real people with real concerns, which in turn I think is the real danger of thinking we know enough about human behavior to make accurate predictions. That kind of thinking is only a few steps removed from the Department of Pre-Crime.
No, I'm sorry, but I haven't had a chance to look at the updated script.   Are you still using an earlier attempt to get audio working?   You could try contacting toleda directly.

All addicts are addicts. There's no distinction between one or another, at least not by the literal term. However, you'll have the addicts who rob, steal, physically hurt others, and really go to extremes to get their fix; on the other end of the spectrum, you have the ones who, while being manipulative, scheming, and resorting to some level of thievery, aren't terrible people (even at their worst).   I would personally think I'm the latter. I did steal from my mom, when I was at my worst, but I never resorted to burglary or actually physically hurting others. Over the past 4 years, I've been paying my mom back (as much as I can, when I can) and so far I've been able to give her around $17,000. I still owe her about $15,000, but I absolutely intend on clearing my debt.  I have no idea what you and your family have been through, although I do know of addicts that have completely fucked up the lives of people that love them, the only people that love them, to the point where they're disowned. It's always sad to hurt the ones you love/d who are also the ones that love you. Luckily, I didn't get so bad that I did irreparable damage to my relationship with my family.  I bring up not knowing you or your situation because of what you said about "fuck drugs and the people that do them". Yes, fuck drugs. Absolutely fuck them. But the people are people. And therefore, are inherently flawed and more susceptible to the grip of addiction. Addiction runs in my family, and it runs the gamut from alcoholism to gambling to narcotics. Weak-willed people I suppose. But in my opinion, it's very easy to say "fuck the person" when you've been hurt by an addict, but it's also easy when you've never had to deal with it.  It sucks.  I'm sure that if 95% of addicts had an option to skip the withdrawal, fill the hole in the soul that most use the drugs to fill, and then go about their lives being happy and healthy.. they would choose that option. But it's not that simple. Think of how many people struggle with tobacco addiction, knowing they'll most likely die from a painful and terrible cancer, and yet they still continue to smoke/chew/rub. Now imagine that quitting tobacco leads to 2+ weeks of intense sickness (like the flu, except way worse). Imagine that a major reason people use tobacco is because they feel it's the only way they can feel any joy or happiness.  I'm just saying that it's easy, from the outside looking in, to say "Fuck the addicts. They need to stop.".  Sorry for the rant/wall-o-text. I hope maybe I could have provided a little insight into what it's like for me and maybe your brother. Best wishes to you and your family.  Also, sorry for any spelling/grammatical errors.

Its not trivial, at all. The quickest estimate I can find is from 2005, and that's $105 billion. Its probably quite a bit more now, and that would just be the projected cost. Knowing typical cost overruns, it could easily run into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and that's just to accomplish something on the level of the apollo program, not even a moon base type thing. Robots are much easier than humans. Delta v for the moon versus mars isn't that big of a difference, its getting living things there because of time.

Another unnaturally dark night settled in once again. It's happening earlier and earlier as winter makes it's way, and that means less time to pretend that I lead a normal life without this ungodly affliction that began when I was exposed to that which is referred to as "pornography". I lay here and I can feel the effects taking over me and it isn't long before I succumb to the gnawing hunger that eats away at me from below as my vision is filled with flashes of unspeakable events. Nobody goes outside now. Not since Jennifer Lawrence.

(Word of warning, my She-Hulk knowledge comes from TvTropes and *Marvel vs Capcom.*  I haven't actually read her comics.)  I don't know what Goyer said, or who he is, even.  I will say that a character being generally sexy or having an active sex life isn't a bad thing, and that there's something to be said for simple titillation value. She-Hulk, in particular, has a number of characteristics and behaviors along these lines:  * Active, positive sex-life *in universe* * Flirty attitude * Lots of observational humor, including observational humor *about her flirty attitude and positive sex life*  (To Deadpool: "If this were the Nineties, I'd be hitting you with the health bar!")  (She's also a smart, successful lawyer and a decent martial artist, among other things.)   If anything, it's cool that you can have a heroic character- *and a lawyer, no less* who's this confident and in control of her own pleasure, and for whom pleasure *isn't a bad thing.* As for her origins?  Total cash grab from back when "X character, with a twist!" was really popular.  (Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, Ace the Bat-Hound, etc, etc).  Hell, She-Hulk was originally a *sketch comedy* character from *Saturday Night Live* or something similar, and Marvel decided they should copyright it before somebody else did.  She was something silly that actually turned into something smart. Sexy can be smart.  Sexy can be virtuous.  There's nothing wrong with sexy.  Sexy is an intrinsic part of us, a part of being human, *and it's one of the good parts.*  If anything, I'm kinda jealous of She-Hulk and characters like her because they get to be sexy.  I'm a pasty, squishy white guy; I can be lots of things, but *Imperius Sex* ain't one of them.  In the end, every creative effort is an attempt at bringing something the creator likes into the world.  Something cool.  Something smart.  Something sexy.  In a way, *everything* is fanservice.  An artist should be a fan of his own work.  That's part of what makes it art.  **Let's bring sexy back.**

All you have to do is save America.  America will save the world.
I was joking about wizards. They are just too powerful. And don't include Tom Bombadil either. Rohan has two rulers, Theodin (and predecessors) and *significant other* (can't remember his name), ruling the east and west respectively. Also, this is just my opinion, add Lake Town as its own province, as it has its own ruler as well
Joel is a more well trained soldier, and makes few mistakes ever.  The entirety of Walking Dead is basically dealing with the consequences of actions, both from Lee and the others.  I don't see him getting too far in a world where the zombies can actually run and hand to hand combat isn't viable.
He has more health (Less in the first phase and more in the more dangerous phases) and its more of the boss rush prior to both fights that will bring your health down and cause you problems in the boss fights. 
&gt; “We never went anywhere because we had no money and we had no car, but I would look out the living room window and see the lights of Staten Island. It was incredibly romantic to me, like Middle Earth. Of course, the danger is you eventually get to Staten Island.” This one is really interesting to me, and I think it explains the roots of his world. Middle Earth, as Tolkien presents it, sounds nice, but a real medieval fantasy world would be a much nastier place.

Guys please don't deny that genetics plays any role at all, then you're just as bad as the fat activists.   There's no doubt that genetics play a role, some people are more predisposed to weight gain than others, this has been well documented.  The point of this sub is that it's still possible to lose weight with diet/excercise, regardless of genetics. It's not an excuse, but that doesn't mean genetics don't have a real effect on a persons weight gain, and being a medical text book it's not wrong to mention this.

You typically post pretty funny things, but this was actually remarkably helpful! I also like the positive and encouraging attitude in your statement. Good for you, buddy. :D  One caveat: if potential future employers see that you're flying from job to job very often, that may indicate instability. To solve this, you may decide to only put particular jobs on your résumé when you update it; another risk of that, however, is that you'll have some gaps in employment which may look questionable.  Just be careful when you make your decisions. :)
At the very least, we can push the price up so that neither Arsenal (not as rich as us) or City (FFP) can afford him. Then pull out of the deal at 11:45pm tomorrow night, or keep him if Welbeck and Chich have completed deals.

&gt;They use OSX on a Hackintosh to run wirecast, a livestreaming package only available on Mac. IIRC they also run Premier on it too, to edit the video shows.  Few comments:  * A hackintosh is cool, but not really relevant for a software discussion  * The premier (production) part is what I am worried about. Why do they find linux solutions insufficient, and how can we meet the needs of very basic video editing?
They have so much energy because they're social. Being alone is a nightmare mentally, it's stressful and utterly depressing. That's  why we have no energy.

Do not do it. Adderall triggered severe psychosis (slow onset of paranoia to full blow psychosis) in my ex-gf. She has bipolar II and the use of adderall and lack of sleep pushed her over the edge. Seeing her suffering breaks my heart every day. I suggest following non-medical approaches for your ADHD (strict schedule, healthy lifestyle, have friends to keep you on track); I know medication makes things easier for the moment but they are not the long term solution - especially when you are susceptible to psychosis. The feeling of calmness right now is not worth the psychosis episodes. Please stop it immediately for the sake of your own well-being.

Doublelift just wanted to ask Seraph since he would most likely be going against Nidalee and if he could keep Nidalee in check they wouldn't have to ban it.  The problem is you can't keep Nidalee in check. A fucking Plat 5 could go into the LCS on Nid and still apply a retarded amount of pressure throughout the entire game. The champ is completely broken atm and SHOULD have been banned or picked by CLG every single game. They should have listened to Zikz.

Ignite when you want to be aggressive and look for kill pressure. Generally only take this on champions you'll be in range to ignite.   Heal is the go to defensive option for mids. Generally mids that aren't looking for aggression per say, such as Ori, lack mobility and the move speed makes up for this as well as compensating for the smaller effective health amount. Barrier can also be ignored until times out for the opponent to use their burst.   Barrier is a niche spell, for cases where you against multiple healing debuffs, want to play safe/don't need flash on a mobile champ, or to survive huge burst that would otherwise 100-0 you.

I don't think you friend understands this game or didn't play it enough. Rift, much like almost every MMO on the market today, is a themepark game.

Here is the relevant text from the Wikipedia article:   &gt; Michael's mother, Valerie Glassborow (1924-2006), who would later marry Peter Middleton, worked at the Second World War Government Code and Cypher School (GC) in Bletchley Park, along with her twin sister, Mary. The codebreaking regularly penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers and is the birthplace of the world's first programmable, digital, electronic computer: Colossus.
Yea, my bad. That superstar part kind of lead me to thinking it, I guess.
Blacksteel is better than Uchi for a Dex build, Uchi slightly better for a quality build.  At 20-40, Chaos Blade has the highest AR, followed by Washing Pole. Darkdrift and Blacksteel lose to Washing Pole by 4AR, the Berserker Blade loses by 9AR, and the Uchi and Manslayer by 10AR.   At 40-40, Chaos Blade first, followed by Berserker. Washing Pole loses by 2AR, Manslayer and Uchi by 12AR, and Darkdrift and Blacksteel by 15AR.

Tell me about a time you got complimented.
come at me bro
Cats are very rarely used for animal testing. It is much more common to tests on rats or dogs. Even then, no lab would be buying animals from a crack addict.
If you need to selectively blur, duplicate layers, mask areas and blur. Depending on blur amount, you might want to fill in areas behind the areas in focus so when you blur, it isn't either sampling empty space or a foreground component of the scene. There are tutorials on how to do this in photo animation tuts. Ignore the aftereffects part and just watch the beginning. 
Really? Why only 4?
Ok I have a good amount of contracts anyway
Not sure if this was meant to be sarcastic. Regardless, I experimented with a few different looks till I found a look/length that worked for me. As I like my hair a bit longer I tend to favor salons over barbers. Expect to spend more than $20. That being said, more expensive != better. Maybe invest in a some decent product. Work on your look. It takes time
Note ii battery doesn't burn :P
lmfao
The Binding of Isaac + Wrath of the Lamb plz
She needs to lay off of World of Warcraft .... ain't nobody got time for that
Or just talking about songs on like More or Atom Heart Mother will make them think "There's more before Dark Side?"
I don't think the animal friend perk extends quite that far.
Akali has a much better laning phase against Yasuo.  Once Akali hits 6, Yasuo just can't lane against her on his own.
Can confirm. My boyfriend plays League all the time. I ain't waiting for that shit
I learned to type by using Memrise on the web.  It took a while but I can type pretty quickly now.  Just remember that all of the consonants are on the left and all the vowels on the right.  There are stickers you can buy to put on your keyboard to help as well.
Just got this awesome mouse pad for $0.99 because of you. Thanks brother!

This is not WTF . It's a wonderful music video  with a blend of art and camp. It's hilarious 
She sounds incredibly stupid. You just side stepped a lifetime of weird shit like that. She clearly has no respect for you, and you are much better off.   Now go out and do something you couldn't have done when you two were dating. You deserve it! :) 
... blah blah gimme gimme
Not the one, sorry. Younger more alternative.
"What did he say about me?"
Thank you for that! Extremely helpful!
Both of my girls like to try grooming my beard, Sullivan just doesn't give a fuck whenever I move her she goes right back to my shoulder and starts again. Gravy doesn't care that much.
I read in a cooking magazine once that it enhances the flavor of the prawn/shrimp to leave as much shell as you're willing to while it's being cooked. I'm from New England, where the best edible crustacean is definitely lobster, but you have to crack the shells and everything. So worth it.

It probably was. I am computer illiterate, so your guess is better than mine. 
He's an interesting prof that's for sure. His teaching style is different from what you would normally expect of a professor. He can be pretty funny sometimes.   If you go to class and pay attention, you'll remember his explanations which will help on his unorthodox exams. No electronics in class. He'll confiscate your phone and make you close your laptop. It's probably better for your learning anyway to not be distracted by electronics. All his notes are in the gBook so you can just write on that. 
Of course they are complete different things, I think you took it way too literal. Often times, both are artificial depictions made to look like something or someone that is real. How do you not get that notion?
But Vulcun got 3rd or 4th during the spring split of 2013
hey, I hope you are right. 
Oh sorry that would be cooler. His reaction is hilarious though. 
Thanks a bunch :)
Note to self never drink NOS or else I might end up looking like that guy.
Could this be a waterproof wearable? Waterproof watches are really convenient and actually useful to have - the market is already there. 
What about getting something like [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/185678743/historic-ring-sterling-silver-twist?ref=sr_gallery_20&amp;ga_search_query=celtic+wedding+band&amp;ga_ship_to=US&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery) and having it rhodium plated at a local jeweler's to match the finish of your engagement ring?
I don't trust one-wipers. I always feel the need to make sure.
you got a link? :)
Someone got that tattoo?  He didn't check spelling first?  I mean, I don't check spellimg that much either, but I ain't inking nobody.
Thanks, looks great! I would take you up on it but I'm in Missouri. :(
I'm not sure to be honest, I got it maybe a year or a little more than a year ago so I'm guessing the original one.  It's very bright, which is why I love it.  Now I am going to hoard it! :)
all added
"You too"
Maybe add a reward for milestones for like 500 wins, 1000 wins etc.  Not an OP reward but maybe something like 10 picks or even a small amount of credits as it seems like the only way to obtain them is by buying them
One cell has, iirc, about 6 billion rungs of DNA. DNA is made of four different nucleotides joining in pairs. So you would have 6 billion to the eighth possible combinations in one human cell. That means there are about 1.3x10^39 possible combinations. So basically you have to realize how much time that would take. To put that into perspective if you were testing one combination a second it would take 4.1x10^31 *years* to test them all. So we're not talking lifetimes, the entire length of the universe doesn't begin to approach that. Even if you got to the point where you could test billions of combinations a second you wouldn't approach anything close to a reasonable amount of time.   Sorry if that's hard to understand, I don't know about your math background and so on but it is hard to explain numbers like that in a way they can really be comprehended - it becomes more like random numbers on a sheet of paper.   TL;DR that would take an incomprehensible amount of time.
wonder where the 24 came from
Also from Britain and can confirm  family believes I am a wizard.
I'm not from the US, but as far as I remember from the last time this was posted, most (or a huge amount) of the funding for Science is actually taken from the Military budget, as the Military funds a large amount of Science in many disciplines.
Thanks :P
thats deep bro...
Wow so original  I'm sure you'd blow everyone away!
I actually feel terrible about this... everyone keeps telling me about the documentary and I haven't seen it! :O

This one crops up all over reddit, but the Dunning-Kruger Effect is pretty interesting. It essentially says the less you know, the more you think you know.  [Link for the interested](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
Oh. *Real* animal heads. I was thinking back to the time I was in 4th grade and the school psychologist thought that I was deeply emotionally disturbed because I tore the head off of a stuffed lamb and put ketchup on the stump. Good thing she never saw my Barbies. 
Slightly. I had a soft egg with it. The heat burn it gave me was horrendous. It's 8:00 now and I'm finally starting to feel a little better. Spaghetti time!!
There is that, but Dignitas, Cloud 9 and Fnatic were all involved with EGL when it was based around MW3 and Black Ops 1
I see the point you're making, and while I agree that doing a survey with that outlook will have unfortunate results, I agree with /u/ahhter. The x/10 scale sucks because 5/10 is average *by definition*, but nobody uses it that way. Personally, I think we need a better system for quantifying satisfaction, especially when peoples' livelihood may be at stake.
I can possibly do that
Did that marksman just got almost hit? Was it enemy fire? Because it got *really* close and he remained calm and didn't even lower his head. Must have nerves of steel.
I did annex them, Hungary became independent instead of transferring to me.  I doubt a 2 province minor like Wurttemburg will ever inherit or integrate Hungary.  In fact I expect they would break free first.
Your costume was fantastic. Was stuck behind you with friends and we were all losing our shit.

I watched it when it first came out, but it faded from my radar when my regular TV watching habit started to ebb.  After seeing Guardians of the Galaxy, I remembered how funny Chris Pratt's character was on the show so I decided to plow through the six seasons on Amazon to be ready for this season.  It's very much worth the time.
Goddammit Nessie, get out of here.
A little late to the party but, [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3264024/?ref_=nv_sr_1) documentary goes into Prop 8's affect on people a bit more. It doesn't however, talk too much about TSCC. 
Hey, yeah, theres a bunch of people at the uni and a semi-organised dnd community (well until wotc killed off thier community!) If you pm me your email or facebook ill cc you into the other people.
I turn the vol on wow and listen to music. xD
So he's chasing pussy?
It's hard to deal with killing a pet in the process. I'm trying to prepare myself for them calling me and telling me he isn't going to make it. :( If we have to try a different reptile we are going with a skunk gecko next. I don't mind taming one. I know how hard they can bite. Hoping that we can keep one alive. Maybe a little easier? Still though I would rather have our little dragon pull through.
I hope he does a future comic about whether there's a bump.
But the guy with HE rounds has a primary that does nothing except stun dozers.  The Thanatos meanwhile will take care of dozers while also killing *everything else.*  Taking a Thanatos is not a sacrifice to anything.  You can still kill shields and Tasers and cloakers all in a single body shot.  Taking HE on the other hand severely limits your firepower because it's such a niche option that only does 1 thing well.  
had the feel lmq could win this 
I disagree, I don't care if our inheritors remember me. 
I ask myself the same question all the time. I'm certainly not here to kiss anyone's ass for getting a new detail job.

Pizza... mostly because it was Friday night ritual for my wife and I.  Now, I eat the toppings, but of a higher quality. Really nice Italian cold cuts, good cheese, olives, good anchovies, etc. All as finger foods.
Yes, the grand canyon and Phoenix valley are very flat.
I will always buy Charmin TP. Gotta go with the best to feel the best. No 1 ply for this guy.
Hoping you didn't flip that.
"The past year" is what I meant, as in the WC and his positive loan spell. I wasn't clear, sorry.
I've done this before and honestly, it's stupid. Spawns need to be fixed so that this doesn't happen so that people can't get minute nuclears with zero effort like I did once before. The only reason I did it was because the other team tried doing it and  they weren't up to par with my team which allowed us to escape. They got what they deserved.
This. Is beautiful. Can... Can I request you do this with a matching (color scheme) Excalibur with the Avalon helmet? Now THAT would be a use for that helmet lol. :)
You should! Do you know what it is your looking to get rid of?
You are far too focused on societies. You keep pushing the "there were mo markets" thing as if I am still speaking about that.  If protectionism preceded man, if protectionism existed before man invented it, then it is part of the state of nature. Then, I am wrong.  But it is as man made as the Eiffel Tower. To that extent, free trade preceded protectionism, and therefore it was a welfare distortion. There's no way to defend KH improvements in justifying ending protectionism because protectionism was uncompensated in the first place.  EDIT: The mere fact that protectionist policies have to be enacted before tariffs and the like exist implies that there was free trade before protectionism.   In other words, if we passed a law saying that September 25th is national puppy day, that implies that there was no such thing as national puppy day before we passed said law.
Glad I wasn't the only one weirded out by the teeth 
Not yet. It's just 8 am.

oh man i need to learn the song of storms let me learn it in the future from this guy then go back in time to teach it to the old man who taught it to me who learned it from me after I learned it from him
I think you meant to phrase it that it has to be spread out over at least a month otherwise you might have a "spree" killer.
Also with Roberto saying we won't sign a defender because we don't need one, his words not mine. I think he's holding his cards close to his chest and will sign a defender tomorrow, whom ? I don't know. He's sneaky, a good sneaky, we'll see though. 
Apparently, we've all forgotten Let's Kill Hitler.  That being said, River is one of my top two candidates as to who Missy really is.
thx im currently playing in it now. i just like this website but they changed alot a things in the latest update
The very elastic portion of this is new customers entering the market. High premium prices on everything creates a financial barrier to entry and it's hard to get somebody with no investment into the hobby to put down money for plastic if the price is insanely high.  In addition high prices encourage army swapping/selling which results in more "supply" being on the market. If it's cheap enough ill shelf my underused army and start a new one but if it's too costly to start a new army I'll do a trade or sell it and possibly buy a used army instead of new product.  Combine this with high prices discouraging buying lots of product "I want meganobz but it's so much for 3 that I'll only get one box instead of 2-3"
Not a teacher but this guy I knew in high school was your average gang banger who just grew up in  the wrong neighborhood, or so I thought, he went on to kill his baby by shaking him for crying. He's in jail now, as the baby's body was also found with bruises on his legs.
There has been plenty of debate, mostly around housing. As National keep rolling out policies the debate will continue. I imagine most of them are keeping quiet outside of policy debate because of the corruption scandal.
Post on the guitar pedals sub. The guys on there will be very helpful. From the styles you mentioned you will want a good tube amp to start with. Then a wah, boost, overdrive, fuzz, octave, univibe clone, delay. Wired in that order. Would be a good start. There are so many good pedals out now it's hard to know where to start for specific model recommendations. The guitarpedals subreddit will give you lots of ideas.
You know what North America was founded by bud,*gasp* foreigners 
Probably Watamote. They'd think we're all making fun of a girl's crippling social anxiety.
Oh wow that would be so awesome. I took a chance on amazon because it was in stock for 25 today which is less than I've seen it in at other places. I'll let you know if I get one with or without the gun. Thanks so much! 
Ok thanks

I'm sorry you got downvoted, but all I'm trying to say is that it's aggravating to see that these people don't even attempt to give this new game a chance before, 1. Not even playing the game, 2. Not even acknowledging that this is an unfinished version of the game that M2K is talking about, and 3. Seeing it has changes from Melee.

No because this is a team game, Doublelift knows like anyone who watches the LCS, the majority of the teams who win will win as a team. The whole superstar "protect the doublelift" didnt work out. Yeah hes a flashy player and a top tier ADC, but he wants it to be a team effort, not a Doublelift carry strat.
I'm not going to defend Ray...but it's certainly possible that he was trying to keep her away from him.  Hopefully he's not a wife beating douchebag.

Had to collapse around 30 replies before finding anything remotely respectful. e: that wasn't a 4th place joke, I might add.  I thought Curse fought hard, but LMQ are a top calibre team. They really went head to head and put their shit on the line for it all. Curse deserve massive praise for showing up as they did, they played *their* game at the end of it all, *their* style, and even though I'm not a Curse fan, I applaud the series. It was fucking awesome to watch, and I'll always love *the BOY!*

Sure. As you may know, standardized testing was one of the main parts of Bush's "No Child Left Behind Act". Standardized testing de-emphasizes critical thinking and the arts in favour of rigid memorization of facts and the ability to perform calculations. One can appear to be doing well according to standardized testing with almost no understanding civic responsibility and without any ability to engage in critical analysis or in the arts. The [Fraser Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Institute), one of the largest deliverers of standardized testing in North America, is not even an education organization: they are a conservative think-tank.

To be fair, while the specifics are bullshit, if we stopped making meat our primary source of nutrition and instead ate a mostly plant-based diet with meat and dairy as small sides rather than the entirety of the meal, it would be really *really* good for the environment and we would have a lot more land to grow food for people that we currently use to produce feed for livestock. Not to mention that it seems that most experts agree that we could do with cutting down on our level of meat intake for several health reasons.
Another classic stalker song from one-hit wonder Tommy Tutone.  "Jenny, I got your number,   I need to make you mine.   Jenny, don’t change your number,   8-6-7-5-3-0-9 (8-6-7-5-3-0-9)   8-6-7-5-3-0-9 (8-6-7-5-3-0-9)"

They're not losing sleep, but humanity is destroying this planet and subjugating it's populations because of people like them.  They're a vampire on this planet and I'm sick and tired of being nice to then while they in their willful ignorance bring about the apocalypse. Fuck them. And yeah, maybe the Amish are relatively harmless, but your either on team delusion or team reason. They've picked their team and they are part of the enemy. Acceptance is only useful when people have an open mind. But when they choose close minded fundamentalism, then they are nothing but a cancer on this earth.

In the first fight you killed tech one cruisers with battleships, and in the second video you've got this retarded 4/1 gun setup with you never using the fifth gun essentially making you deal 80% dps. What the fuck is the point of these videos? They sure aren't making you look good.

Hacked phones, presumably. The pictures were stolen by someone who thought it would be a good thing to do to post them online.
It would be nice to create maps in vector, because I've made some maps in raster and then later needed to resize them, and realized I should have originally created them as larger images.  But unfortunately, a lot of great techniques for creating land-water maps are textural, involving combining and subtracting different raster textures.  I'm sure that similar techniques are possible with vector, but I think you'd need more experience and really need to know what you were doing. However, once you've settled on a final land-water map using raster, it makes sense to convert to vector before you start adding geographical features like rivers, mountains and place names.  Then you can scale up and down at will.
I went into it blind.  I was very confused around about 30 minutes in... and quite honestly, a little disappointed. Not to say From Dusk Til' Dawn was a bad movie it just promised something different and I was sad because it seemed to being living up to that promise well.

Because many french players are big flamers.  I'm French myself but NEVER mention it, or answer to people speaking French.  Problem is, most French "decent" people (not skill wise, but mentality) just hide the fact they're French, like I do.  So now, the french douchebags are even more prevalent in proportion, in the eyes of other players.
Went too HAM and I'll probably be sugaring off all my skin when my order comes. Got two oils (Fairgrounds &amp; Fireworks and Lady Grey), three sugar polishes (Apricot Fairy Floss, Fern &amp; Elf, and Alva Starr) and two glossing oils (Coconut Cream and Peaches and Dragonfly). It was hard to justify spending so much, but I intend to give four or five of those items away as gifts for Christmas, and I figure since the spring/summer Haunt items appeal to me more than the rest of the catalog does, I'm not likely to spend too much more there until next summer. 
This is surprising? Carter gets plenty of singles and doubles, just lots of HRs too. Singleton can only strikeout and sometimes hit a HR. Springer strikes out way more than Carter as well.

It's political and the settlers are used as pawns (the irony that the Palestinians are used as pawns by the Arab world has not escaped me).  In exchange for some peace or disarmament or acceptance, Israel removes settlements, when the Palestinians piss off the Israeli government, they build another.  A friend of mine had a few settler friends who were very pissed off with the Israeli government for how they are treated.  The fact is that houses in the settlements are very cheap and ideal for poor Israelis (thus no rich settlers).

* Require Ukraine to wage a proper war. * Give Ukraine money (heck, if Greece and Spain borrow at 2%, EU fiscal authorities could cough up ten or twenty billions for UA) * Provide all military support that doesn't require legislative approval - surveillance, decryption, UAVs from Israel etc. * Tell Putin that Ukraine will never be a NATO member * When Ukraine rebuilds its army and stabilizes internal situation hit Russia hard with sanctions for annexation of Crimea. Hard as in asset freezes, overall trade ban etc. This one is kinda questionable, destabilizing a nuclear power is not a thing you would normally do.  As far as I understand Ukraine and West need to call Putin's bluff. I think C-130 carrying humanitarian night vision sights would be enough.  Even if the West doesn't care about Ukraine it should care about its reputation and show it's not to be fucked with.
I'd prefer something closer to what SAO does with complete neural immersion rather than something like the Kinect because what you can do with the latter will ultimately have limitations with the room's boundaries. With neural immersion, the only limitations are the programming and the mind.

Again you're just using ad hominems and not actually saying anything to back up multiculturalism. This is why it hasn't worked in Britain, you guys are so quick to shout racist at everything and everyone suffers for it.  Multiculturalism in Britain isn't like in other countries, Multiculturalism basically here basically means let the minorities do what they want otherwise we're not being tolerant enough.

Great story, 10/10 would read again.
Well, the US has already annexed all of the small nations within its sphere of influence and the genocidal acts it committed are nearly a century old... so I suppose what I'm trying to say is Israel is committing genocide, just like the US did, just like Stalin, just like Hitler. The only difference today is that the internet and cameras exist now.  Furthermore, "all of the innocents" who are dying are dying as a result of ethnic and religious cleansing of the people of Palestine. Israeli doctrine boils down to two ideas: Racism and Religious monopoly.
And here we are again.  For god's sake, stop thinking like that. They are one of the best teams in your REGION. Does it really matter from where they are? Just cheer for them in worlds and stop trying to find excuses to dislike them/justify your disappointment with your team.
I am that person that never calls anyone. It's because I really am too absorbed in my life to have any energy for anyone else.   I've started actually being fully introverted, not hanging out with friends, not talking if I don't want to, and now, I'm *finally* beginning to notice some progress where I occasionally actually *want* to hang out with people, it doesn't last long, but it is progress.   If my friends and family died, I would definitely feel a sense of loss, like I didn't get to interact with them like I wanted to. Because regardless of if I hang out with them, I never really feel sincere around people, this is probably why I find interaction so draining.   I have a lot of work to do, and I try to tell people that it in no way reflects upon them. But some people don't understand, that's just life. 
LMQ changed up and stopped playing aggressive. No longer looking for odd ganks. Just farmed up and win. The only lane that was losing was Ackerman vs lulu top. Taking control of objectives.   Curse failed to adapt.

I think Steam has spoiled me. The Walking Dead Season 2 just had their final 5th episode to make it a complete game. The sale price was 9.99, down from 24.99. I didn't buy it, because it didn't drop to 4.99, the price of the first season I got on a steam sale last year. Now I look at these triple A failure games that constantly push DLC. You're right, why not wait for a GOTY edition when all the bugs are fixed. Also, backlog is huge. 
Thanks again. :)

Curse lost the series because Xpecial didn't think Regi would kick him. /s  That shit was so long ago and it almost worked out better for both parties. Hell, it probably should have but they tilted so much after losing game 3.
Wow, that's absurd. There are few nations, if any, whose population is homogeneous. I bet China doesn't expect their citizens of Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese etc. descent to be loyal to those countries just because their ethnic heritage originates from there.

Welp, time to start watching Fullmetal Alchemist. It's been too long since I watched an episode. I was on like episode 8 and suddenly got distracted with other stuff, so now I'm gonna sit down and finish it.   AOTD: I don't know any... but maybe you guys could recommend some good ones?   AOTD2: I haven't, but I want to.   AOTD3: I don't usually hate things because it feels like a waste of energy to me. I mean, I hate stuff like Nazis and terrorists and things like that, but any sane person hates those things. Other than that, I try to be positive about stuff even if I don't like it.
&gt; Getting mad when other people don't like a game that's not even out yet because a guy on facebook told them that it's bad  FTFY
Depends. Him stealing objectives without any meaningful followup can result in a bad teamfight, or just him being dead and 5v4 objective pushes. I'm a jungle main, and I usually play gank heavy jungelers, If I ever saw a nunu I would just spend even more time in lanes. Ultimatly even counterjungling is a team based effort. If your lanes arent aware, and ready to rotate to help you, 90% of the time the enemy lanes will rotate much much faster. In the end, he just ends up too team reliant, for me at least, to take into soloQ.
Looking for some cool ideas that would require little to no water once established.  The bed is about 2ft wide. It's right next to the house. The gas meter doesn't really add to the appeal, but it can't be moved.  The rocks are easily moved. The area has morning sun for a couple hours, but shaded in the afternoon (the photo faces south, house is on the west).
I love #2 in the first set.
I wanted Whos League to be good so badly. I liked most of the personalities on it: Sjokz/Nick Allen/Travis. Surprisingly, Nick Allen was a pretty cool guy before Riot gave him bitch duty and now he is the scapegoat for fines on LCS players. Even that writer from Dignitas was pretty cool, Katanamordecai I think? It's just it got dreadful after about 10 minutes, and with all the technical problems, it was kind of a disaster.
My favorite is probably The Invincible Iron Man.

That's an interesting point actually. Azula caves to pressure once she's unhinged, but she doesn't reach he breaking point the same way because Ozai stays behind. Would Ozai and Azula fight together well or would his presence and the importance of the outcome of the fight be too much for her?  I could see it going either way honestly. Either him verbally abusing her during the fight until she snaps or their ruthlessly efficient villainy-ness making them the ultimate dangerous duo.

Imagine a computer program.  Make one random change to the source code, one random new letter, and run it. Does the computer program run better, worse, or give the blue screen of death?

I actually did not notice that part. It's still not great if you only have 1 creature though.
I'm just remembering the abuse I had to put a full bowls' worth of salvia through to trip.  Bone-dry leaves, fully packed bowl, pocket torch, the biggest hardest coughing-est hit I've ever taken.  That being said, I really don't think so.  Especially with how mild the Pax draws.  Can't hurt to give it a try, though.
They never meant to overthrow aristocracy. The story of the 18th century is the erosion of the power of the traditional landed nobility by the new merchant aristocracy. The American Revolution is basically. Microcosm of this. They wanted to replace landed nobles with themselves.  Also, it's pretty funny that you call these ideas "exceptions"  when the founders ditched the  AOC's as soon as it was obvious they would need a stronger and less democratic central government in order to clamp down on popular unrest.  Lastly, calling something "revisionist history" does not mean what you think it does.

I think couples counseling would be *wonderful* idea. I think it's a good idea for every couple tbh.   Also, re what I said about accommodating her sex drive, I just wanted to add that I'm speaking from personal experience. This last fall I had a bit of a hormone kerfuffle, and my sex drive just *plummeted*. My poor bf had such a hard time with it, because I had literally no interest in sex. What made it worse for a while is that he kept trying to initiate sex at the same rate he's always done, and I eventually started resenting him for it. I felt like he was putting me under so much pressure to do something I didn't want to do, and I also felt really guilty that I didn't want to sleep with someone so wonderful and sexy. Luckily, my bf was so lovely and patient with me - he made it clear that he didn't expect me to do anything I didn't want to, and he let me sort of take the lead on our sex life for a couple of months, so I didn't feel as much pressure.   Something that really helped us (in addition to me getting counseling and medication) was him backing off on the sex stuff a little. So, for example, he stopped initiating sex *every* morning, and we started scheduling sex more so I wouldn't feel like it was being sprung on me. We also watched a lot of porn together so that I could be with him while he got off, and we learned a ton of new ways to be together sexually that didn't involve actual sex. We also started talking more about fantasies and kinks, and exploring those together helped us start having sex that didn't feel like the old routine. In retrospect, the whole thing was a bit of a blessing in disguise. So, patience and open communication will really help you here.

She knows what she's doing through and through.

Hello there - this does not mean being paranoid. This kind of stuff can happen. How much you have to be paranoid really depends on your game/app and the amount of work you have put into it.  I would go with somebody with a proven track record for updating an existing app. And even in this case, make sure to look carefully through the existing feedback of the guy with completed contracts. I have had to deal with scammers on websites like eLance and oDesk - even though in web development, not game development - that had dozens of feedbacks. Feedbacks can be fabricated, as well. For example, be wary of a guy having 20 reviews, all coming from the same 3-4 clients; or be suspicious of a guy having reviews only from clients with only 1 completed contract in their job list.

I guarantee you I could very easily go to Finland and buy a gun illegally.  If I were to go and commit a crime with a gun why would I use one that is registered to my name?  In Canada there are fewer gun crimes than the US, but I have honestly never really heard of anyone being stabbed to death here. In Canada stabbings are very common. People will always find a way to kill each other. I'd rather die to a gun shot than be stabbed or bludgeoned to death.  There are a lot of things that happened that would be considered much more severe crimes than murders by a firearm in other countries and they are actually quite common.  It's not that gun laws make it easy to get access to firearms it's the fact that the United States is a VERY large country with boarders that are far too easy to cross illegally. It makes it extremely easy for illegal arms traffickers to bring firearms into our country. Our country has a problem with organized crime simply because there is so much money and too many open roads you can't easily police.  Every country has organized crime and where there is organized crime there are illegal firearms, so yes you can easily get a gun anywhere.

Everything happens as a result of an ancient history of cause-and-effect. And how is saying "this is your own fault" an "effort to correct the situation?" Don't you think that people thinking like that could actually be contributing to the problem? People are good at meeting people's expectations of them.

This is necessary for security and stability, and is made possible by using the memory management unit of the hardware, which enforces these protections through virtual memory.  It's thus not only possible but common for every executable on the system to have the same entry point, without there being any clashes.  Address 0x01000000 in process A is not the same thing as address 0x01000000 in process B.  (*) Examples of non-modern operating systems that had shared address space would be 16 bit versions of Windows and Mac OS 9 and earlier.  These have been out of service for decades.
Nah, that's the first one.

Well if u came on the google hangouts you'd know because I moan like fuck when I've had a bag time and got chewed up.. I usually call most of the prices and trades i'm making or planning to make and talk about what was profitable and how much it made me. . just like I talk about the losses and how pissed off I am with those also, what I did wrong and so on.. .  all while burning my animal entrails with mercury in retrograde.

Except that makes no sense because the dynamic between people like ZQ and games media is totally different from the dynamic between big publishers and games media.  It's not a representative example so why is it a lightning rod?
I didn't read the other comments here, but I think you should talk to your school's counselor or something.  I worked for awhile in an elementary school, and I had a student with oppositional defiant disorder.  What you're describing definitely sounds familiar to me.
Running joke since C9 was considered TSM's sister team cause C9 Jack used to be TSM Jack.  Jack asked Regi for advice in picking up the C9 team (and possibly, it was a long time ago, I don't remember, money)
I'm a girl but I was rather rough as a child, able to justify pushing or kicking my friends with whatever I was feeling at that moment. This was also in elementary school. After I made a kid bleed after kicking him in the shins, and another incident where my girl friend's parent had to address me for pushing her down on the curb, I eventually let the bullying let up.   I can't remember for sure what I felt at the time - I think more than empathy it was guilt, knowing what I did was bad and not quite sure how to explain why I did it. Heat of the moment. I didn't realize how much pain I could inflict on people and it always kinda surprised me when I did hurt them. Didn't know my own strength or something.  Anyway, the people I hurt most were the ones closest to me, but I eventually grew out of it. I'd keep an eye on that situation though, and bring it up to a school therapist or someone of the sort if at all possible.  If it's any consolation, I turned out completely normal decades later, save for the rotting bodies in the cedar closet of my basement. Peeeerfectly normal.
I hung a resin Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus figurine, which I had hand painted in Technicolor, from a light so that Jesus could shine down upon us during study. I wasn't religious.

Shipping was 6k, half the rent the rent is 4k, tickets run 1~2k. All the costs do not happen at once but as your plan unfolds the money starts to burn. There is other shit you never consider like painters, cleaners, brokers, these burn cash fast. It helps if you own an apartment you can rent out or have some other forms of making money. Also, I am currently working out of the states and draw a paycheck form that.

Umm did you people read this persons post on conspiracy? Obvious troll is obvious. The person says nothing to even try to change anyone's minds or present a valid argument in any form except calling people names and trying poorly to belittle them. If the conspiracy theorist think one thing and you all think the other, what about the people in the middle who don't know either way besides that two sides both make radical claims compared to the other and even if you draw the line in the middle it's still enough to be skeptical of either side.

This can certainly work.  My wife and I are both bisexual but she generally isn't interested in sex with men outside of our relationship.  My wife and I would be perfectly comfortable with me having a relationship with a guy that she would probably have no interest in or at least would respect boundaries.
explain to me how it's a crime? I pay for the service through AT&amp;T and they give the right to ESPN to offer that channel through their authorized app, WATCHESPN, which then has built in capabilities to use that app with Chromecast. From where I sit, there shouldn't be any legal issues with that. It's the same as if I were to cast my app to my home tv, except this was to a device that was plugged into a display hub. Since it wasn't streaming through an illegal and unauthorized site, it shouldn't be an issue. What If I had 40 people over at my house and set up a few different tvs in different locations, could I not stream my paid for content from my phone and my tablets to each of my tvs if I have purchased multiple chromecasts, or had a display hub set up? I believe your idea of illegal streaming is incorrect here. 
Biggest change always happens the day after the gameweek and he's had a 22% change today according to totalFpl, there's always a big drop off in activity unless the player is transferred/injured after that. That's why this 2 weeks for trades is overrated.
That's unfortunate, but I think Raulerson will do fine. He seems to have the spirit to win, and apparently he loves being a Longhorn. Give him a few games to get comfortable, and bulk up a bit, and he'll make a great 4 year starter.

I studied philosophy for seven years as a grad student. I never finished my dissertation, but I did get an M.A. for my time.  I am self-employed where I take clients. I read and analyze texts for them, give advice on how they can maximize utility, think game theoretically for them so they can act rationally, construct arguments to advance their positions, and deliver those arguments orally and in writing.  I should mention I went to law school after leaving philosophy. Philosophy did help me to learn to do all of those things though.

If you can't see blood or something on the door then it's just germs isn't it? At lest mostly?

"Because you know you can't take what you give."
At times I can't believe how removed from reality some of the people posting on reddit really are.  1. When the country is under attack, patriotism EXPLODES. Not to mention that if we're talking about the USA, it's already a pretty nationalistic country.  2. If too many people "take the jail sentence", they'll replace that with execution, to "facilitate" your choice. When a country (well, its leaders, really) decides to go to war, they will have their soldiers one way or another.  People have been forcefully drafted for hundreds of years.  The practice might have stopped recently (on a historical scale) in the civilised world, but I am pretty sure it's still used in some places on the globe and it can be brought back in a second if needed.
He was probably too tired after working hard all day, like my dad was.
I really meant that all buildings are quiet, even the "loud ones;" Especially the loud ones are more noticeable because they are trying to make as much noise as intended  but they can't break free because they are inanimate objects: inanimate objects that sometimes scream with a certain life force but inevitably remain quiet.  But, thinking it over, it's probably a very simple and straightforward answer because pretty much all of science can answer that question in a boring way that may lead nowhere new (audio frequencies, biology and geology, physics, psychology, engineering... something that way).  I got the thought from a documentary on Frank Gehry. He had a designed a very obtrusive yet visually appealing building that was built in the middle of town. A local there said it "looked like a space ship landed there a thousand years ago and we just built around it" [I'm paraphrasing]. Buildings have a quiet timelessness to them, as if there's a maturity or wisdom there  Then again, there are poorly made buildings which break apart and make actual noise.  But anyways there is a sense of quiet in both "loud" and "quiet" buildings.
I'm gonna play this and love it even if it's terrible.

I made one during a rush once. First one came out super foamy so I had to remake it. The next one i just dumped a fuckload of iced and the espresso on top.

She went back to the register and tipped. ehehehehhehehe.
Intelligence is genetic; it is one's innate capacity for smartness. One can be smart in a given field, but unintelligent overall. Conversely, being *really* smart requires a certain level of intelligence.

Guys sudden link finally got the watch ESPN app. I can watch the race at my trap shoot! Oh happy day!
We've seen it happen before. Also, for the team that is 2-0, they should be scared. It's not as simple as having 3 more tries. Momentum means a lot, but imo, the momentum you gain from winning that third game from being 0-2 is probably more than the momentum the winning team brought from the previous two games combined. 0-2 has nothing to lose then suddenly gain new life, while the team that had the momentum reached a high just to crash and burn, possibly being demoralized more than the two games the losing team experienced combined. This is why bo5s are the best. They still contain quite a bit of volatility, but it's the perfect amount of games to pressure people to adapt quickly, both strategically and emotionally, and it's not a crapshoot like a bo3, and if everything were a bo7, we wouldn't get sleep.

Dogs start out smarter than kids (well, in human terms anyway). Kids eventually figure out what things are probably going to kill them better than dogs (yes, I know the chocolate looks amazing, but you still can't have it) but for a while they're not that dissimilar. Gotta train both of them.
Unfortunately we said that about the winter window, and we were all massively let down. I don't see a reason why that would change, sadly. Here's to hoping Arsene changes his ways though!
They will pretty much eat everything, they can't have cooked pork or seasoned meat though. They'll eat vegetables and raw meat, mostly chicken. They're actually more like dogs than cats, but they are pretty similar to cats.
All the time, I get extremely angry for almost no reason sometimes but its usually whenever I remember something that I did that put me in a bad position.
