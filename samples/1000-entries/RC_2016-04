Splarnst...I believe that the flag wasn't always updated every new state, but sometimes with two or three. Maybe I'm wrong though, I'm not an expert, just a flag lover like all of you! I'm sure there are more then 48 versions somewhere out there!
I don't think Necro is worth at all to use for VMS build.   I support what Cinara said. About Occultist - you will have to use Bino for prolif, and won't have shock/burn/chill, but instead gain OP es regeneration, plus chaos resist debuffing. In SC I'd definitely play Elementalist, actually I already do, but for HC - definitely Occultist ES version
Nice list.   I thought &gt;Shadows of Self seemed rushed.   Brandon would stop in the middle of dialogue to write in an entire info dump about the past.  All though I still enjoyed the book, I would look up at times and go "Really? Why now :("
depends on 1.9's lifespan.  1.7 was a golden ages in part due to being the main modded version for a much longer than average time. If 1.8 was stable when it first could have been, 1.7 would probably be pretty lacking compared to today.  If Mojang takes it's time with 1.10, and we get some good performance tweaks compared to how 1.8 runs now (it's kinda shit performancewise compared to 1.7), 1.9 could be pretty darn good.
Same here. officially was registered democrat before but I honestly had never planned to vote in a primary until Mr. Trump came around.

The two teams that Liquid and CLG had to compete with to get out the groups are playing like dogshit and have been for a while, granted Liquid did beat fnatic but it was a BO1, so it doesn't mean too much.
Yeah the monotone thing is a big problem for me. It's hard for me to differentiate from being too exaggerated and getting my emotion across. I don't really care about if I alienate viewers are not, but I do try not to be super offensive cause that just seems rude to me. Thanks for the kind words though!

Here here!
I'm 27, I have a Bachelor's degree. Unemployed. Insane student loan and credit debt. On the verge of homelessness. No diseases or illness, no alcohol or drug use. Basically last summer I got a job offer across the country from where I lived, I took it because it was a great opportunity for me, so I thought. Things quickly unraveled upon moving here and found out there wasn't going to be a place for me and I'd probably have to wait 9months to a year to be officially hired. So the last few months have been awful and now everything is getting cut off, car was repossessed, fridge is empty, I have less than a week to come up with two months of rent or I will be on the street. Yeah, I'm very unhappy, and that's not even the personal stuff.

Does no one else think this major WILL give them a hunger to win though? I mean, think about it: C9 was considered the best NA team before the major because of how they were tearing it up online, and then shit the bed. This is par for the course with international tourneys and C9, BUT something else happened, too: CLG and Liquid made it out. Now it's not just NA just shitting the bed, it's just Cloud 9. If somehow they don't make giant strides to improve after this, I will finally believe that they won't ever do it. However, I personally think this is the motivation we as fans have been looking for and I'm hoping we see some good come of it.
Fascinating read. Thank you for taking the time to write all that out.

I don't know if I dislike Trump or Cruz more.   I agree with Trump that Cruz may not be eligible to be President. He was born in Canada and "natural born citizen" really isn't defined.  I agree with Cruz that Trump is ridiculous and that he needs to not bring Heidi Cruz into this (although if Cruz had anything to do with Melania's photoshot being used in an ad that's out-of-bounds too).
gbtacoman88 will be starting soon, not a sherpa. just 2 players willing to help. and get easy shards. 
Considering the huge numbers by which he's winning among younger voters, I think a candidate like him that is a little more amicable and a better talker will get the Democratic nomination in a decade or two, maybe three, and possibly win the presidency.

Hi Buck_Thorn! You did not include the image's resolution (the width and height in pixels) in the title. You should put the resolution in brackets at the end of your title.

Using http://dxm.darkridge.com/calc.html it says that amount (354mg) will be pretty much on the border of 2nd and 3rd so you should take more or less depending on which plateau you want

&gt; I would like to know if this would qualify as a HIPAA violation  No.  Your wife authorized(or at least, appeared to authorize) the release of the information by giving the doctor directly to the nurse to discuss her condition.  The rest of the issue, regarding your disagreement with the medical officer's opinion, is not a HIPAA matter at all.  You can certainly discuss this with your chain, or with his chain, but HIPAA isn't really applicable here.

Ok, there is no question that Lebron is suffering from some kind of Michael Jackson disorder and i pitty him for that, but it bothers me that some people still compare him to the all time greats Kobe&amp;Jordan, who were on a whole different level mentally. Other than that, fuck Cleveland 'fans'.

1. We do not know for certain whether anyone truly has salvation in their hearts or whether it is just an appearance they keep up. Hitler claimed to be a Christian, but I doubt he truly believed the message of Christ.  2. We should never place limits on the grace of God. Who are you to say that God will not appear to Bill Gates in the last moments of his life in an amazing and transforming way, for example?  I think we will be very surprised in heaven, both by the people we did not expect to find there, and by those we do not find.

Do I believe that a local government would cut costs without really thinking it through?  Absolutely.  Local government is filled with part-timers who are either too terrible to advance politically beyond their town or are driven by insane ideology.  I'm not saying that someone shouldn't look into what happened. The registration issue I think is more interesting but it also seems that lots of different people were affected; I guess I don't have too much faith in the ability of anyone involved to pull off a conspiracy.
Thanks. I'll be sure to post similar things to this over there next time!

Yeah, as much as I am a Bernie supporter, I simply do not understand people who would swing to Trump failing that. I don't know if they simply can't comprehend how much worse a choice he is or just don't care (I don't know which is worse). The thing is, I don't want Hillary - I would rather stay home than have her. But Trump is **SO** much worse, there's not even a comparison. I can't imagine how any decently informed, non-Republican voter could possibly think voting for Trump would *ever* be a good idea, no matter how much you want to "punish" the establishment.

I always thought of it as a safety issue. People are going to do it, have been for millennia, seems only proper to provide a safe professional environment to do it in. That being said, proper sexual education would reduce the amount of unwanted pregnancies.  I know I couldn't make that call, but i can understand why someone would.  All that out of the way, if someone uses abortion as a form of birth control instead of the ending of the potential for life that it is, then they are a complete piece of shit
Yes, but I wouldn't ignore them either. It's still a red flag for Hillary.

Someone's been reading about Rawlsian Veils of Ignorance.  Most of them, no. The ones that are set in Earth's future ... Maybe. I've got perhaps three that I wouldn't mind seeing, living in, or being raised in. They're all transhuman post-scarcity polystate civilizations that are like less-powerful versions of the Culture, and their problems are not quite like our problems. A life free of worry about most diseases, with untrammeled political freedom, generally egalitarian social mores, and an optimistic history where we escape the Cradle seems like a good deal to me.

Curious on what the African American genocide is called in that timeline. Still Holocaust?
As an anecdote and nothing else, I have found all of my uber drivers to be of a really high quality. There was no attitude and great customer service.  Taxi drivers have been rude to me in so many different ways, that's why I started uber in the first place.  I do like that shofer seems a bit more legitimate. The set price and auto payment is brilliant. Money is the reasons some of the drivers have gotten rude. Taking away that element keeps the interaction simple.
It means they have to have proper licensing. Something that should have already been done or at least anticipated long ago.  There is also this.  *(5) No person may mail, ship, or otherwise cause to be delivered any vapor product in connection with a delivery sale unless prior to its sale to the purchaser, the person verifies that the purchaser is at least eighteen years of age  through a commercially  available database, or aggregate of databases, that is regularly used by government  and  businesses for the purpose of age and identity verification.*  In other words. They have to now include age verification through a third party verification system for online sales.
Because Cruz loves making a lot of noise and losing. It's what he's done in the senate, it's what he's doing now, and it's hard to guess what the next step up is for a guy who loves losing in a principled fashion. Maybe he can start some doomed holy war? More likely this is simply his peak though. It's hard to beat losing to a liberal in a Republican primary.

Search for a React/redux webpack starter app. There are quite a few and I they all chose to do things a little differently. But it will have everything lined up for you read who go.   Webpack was very confusing to me coming from Gulp. You definitely should just use a starter webpack config vs wiring it up from scratch in your first app. 
My point is that teams are making moves to fill gaps, strengthen weaknesses, improve strengths, and train players.  Things are happening all over the NFL.  If your only reason for being good is that nothing changed, then that's not a good reason for why your team will be succeeding next season.  There is such a thing as stagnation.

That's probably because in EU, people support their country's top team and not so much the region. The same thing kinda happens in NA, but because there's only three countries (and currently CLG and TL has only players from US), they support the whole region. I'm pretty sure most Swedes choose to support fnatic or NiP, French support nV or G2 and so on.

When we have an episode about Mr. Smiley, I'm about 50% sure that it would be a reveal that he is Lars's (adoptive?) dad.  My reasoning for this is because in the episode where we met Barb (Sadie's mom) we also saw most of the established families in the series standing together and Lars was standing [next to Mr. Smiley](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/930/139/278.jpg). And if you think about all the stereotypes for angry, angsty kids, they usually have parents who are very happy, seemingly well-adjusted people.

Of course, tumblrina completely oblivious that making a character creation software requires to code a lot of  stuff in it, and adding more genders will likely cause more bugs that would need fixing and that requires time, energy, money and talent; and that other possible "genders" are not high enough percentage to be considered in stuff like this, also this is mainly for sexual preferences since in Miimaker/Miichanel(the software) you get all customization options for every character you want to make regarless of gender.  Also this is Nintendo, a japanese based company.  If you want to put your "gender" shit in a videogame, make the videogame yourself, but that would require effort and talent; which most sjw lack. Why not money and time? cause they got fuck tons of that.  tl;dr: Creating more "genders" options is not efficient neither necessary.

Their owners tend to love it. Last weekend an owner told me I made her day when I recognized her dog as a Welsh Terrier instead of mistaking it for an Airedale puppy. 
&gt; sizeof(int) on an x86_64 CPU is 4, not 8.  Depends on the operating system! Some systems use an ILP64 ABI, where `int` and `long` are both 64-bit. This is admittedly rare, but it *does* exist.  Windows and Linux differ on `sizeof(long)` as well; `long` is 32-bit on Windows, but 64-bit on Linux.

I think they'll give him a main event run and then promote him after Summer Slam. Man had earned it imho. 
Yeah, and sometimes better than 30 yellows.
Weird, maybe expired early? Or someone else snaked it. I never used it 
oh hey there, I know you too! 
Great. Now how am I supposed to go about my day being a cold, cynical bastard after watching that?
No, you are not damaging your testicles (unless the laptop catches on fire or something). 
I think some of this stems from the anthology format. Each season is going to cater and appeal to a, sometimes vastly, different audience than the last and this leaves opportunity for people to draw endless comparisons between the seasons that were on par with their interests against the ones that were not. So regardless of how well-done a season may be, there's going to be an audience that didn't enjoy it or the subject matter because it didn't live up to the expectations set forth by a previous season. Now, I know this only applies to those who have watched multiple seasons, but I think it's something to take into account if we are going to compare the type of hate AHS gets to the type of hate that something like TWD gets. Having said all that, I do agree that the hate on this sub tends to be all too common but I'd also attribute a lot of it to those trolling users that know what to say to piss off an AHS fan.
Comcast doesn't actually enforce the cap in Houston right now. I'm not sure if they ever have actually, but most likely will at some point in the future as they are slowly expanding the areas they do enforce it.
&gt;There's a difference between agreeing with some of a candidates ideas and agreeing with a candidate.  Is there? What's that?   &gt;For starters, that's not all his proposals is it?  Of course there were not statistics on whether people agree with every word he ever said. No.  I will add here that we apparently disagree on what leadership means.  Can you answer this simple question? when 80% of Americans wanted war with Iraq, would a good leader have carpet bombed and created the environment which lead to the formation of ISIS, as Bush did? or would a good leader have kept our troops at home?
TL;DR ex = asshole 
Yes, unless you are willing to send first &gt;&lt; anyway I kept play on that account so something is changed, I gained another blue ticket leveling on 60, and I got a Christmas Kotori SR-  Are you still willing to trade? No other thing changed!

Unfortunately, I think many more people than not lack the courage to be upfront about their true feelings in ALL relationships, but this seems especially pronounced at the beginning of romantic relationships. So there's always the possibility that someone is not being straight with you, and it can be hard to tell because of the emotions involved.   That said, it doesn't seem to me like he's blowing you off necessarily. I'm sort of on the fence with this one. If I were you, I'd go with my gut on how I felt about breaking it off vs. being patient. If feelings make it unclear for you right now, it can be good to step away from communicating or interacting for a few days and see what happens. I'd bet if you did this, the answer would become clearer to you.
You might enjoy Morrowind if you're into this kind of questing.  The combat is terrible and you need to mod the shit out of it to get it to look nice and all that, but I played through the game again last fall after many years and had a real good time.

No in the Republican primaries trump gets a LOT of independents whereas Cruz doesn't. If these numbers hold true (a statistical tie among Republicans) than trump has the upper hand due to independents.

Yes. It's the same thing. Your sensory nerves are physiologically basically identical to the nerves which release and receive hormones and signalling molecules responsible for vasodilation/constriction, and since neuropathy results in the death of many of these cells without a concordant adjustment in the amount of hormones, the fine balance becomes screwed up.

I'm sure you all are gonna say that at least they can play at events. Well let's be honest if dazed could play he'd probably be there playing well. Dazed can't play cause he threw a game but he still is the best IGL mind in NA, what events he can play in and can not play in is irrelevant. He still can have an opinion and he is correct in saying it was sloppy CS.
Noooo. Social classes are defined by their relationship to the means of production and other classes.  In socialism, the proletariat would become the ruling class.  After capitalism worldwide is abolished, socialism is global, the bourgeoisie are destroyed, and the need for the state is gone, thus communism, there would be no proletariat or bourgeoisie.   Proletariat is defined as the class that engages in operating productive property owned by the bourgeoisie for wages given by said bourgeoisie.  The class system as we know it would cease to exist entirely under communism. There would no longer be a proletariat. 
i guess i can say the same about the far left. but i'm not scared about thoughts.

If it was the only one, yes, you could make the argument. But its one of several, and indeed, the weakest one. How about this one: assuming both teams ADCs have 50% crit chance, and attack 10 times, there is a 25% chance one of them gets at least 2 more crits than the other one. Which, in 10 attacks, is a pretty big deal. This is not something that happesn never. Its something that happens every fourth teamfight. Basically, every game.

The southern states seceded primarily due to increased tariffs/taxation. The American Revolution was primarily due to taxes. Even the whiskey rebellion was about taxes.

This is getting expensive. You will probably have to pay to have an inspection by someone to determine that your house isn't up to code and that emergency services should stay away. Also someone will have to determine if the house is going to cause a risk to the environment because of your bad plumbing or septic (you cant have a professional fix it since your house is a death trap), the neighbors houses (fires can start other fires blocks away in the right conditions), etc. Fire departments are going to have inevitable lawsuits when they don't rescue someone. Even if they are frivolous they are still expensive. Then we are going to have to decide how to handle crime. That is a whole different emergency service. Just working out how to handle all of this is insanely expensive. To me its just a big can of worms unless you are out on your own in the middle of Alaska or something.

haha yup. Parked next to an i8 the other day and was looking at the two while waiting for seats at a restaurant and noticed how many design details they share. The i3 is a "funky" looking car. 
Did you see the TIFU when some guy hid that in his bank office for a week or two, someone found it and they called in the cops and corporate for a "suspicious device". That sort of shit is what put me off the original design.

If there are any seafood markets/restaurants around you might want to check and see if they sell cooked/chilled soups etc. There's a seafood market here that sells corn and crab bisque by the quart that is way better than anything you'll get in a can, just a bit more expensive. Totally worth it, though.

Imagine a huge war between Elfhelm and Falconia Breaks out. After many insane battles and epic fights Gut's finally slays Griffith, but in his dying moments he finds that Guts carried a Behelit with him all this time after it drops from his pouch, only for Griffith to quickly snatch it like 'I Sacrifice'- no hesitation. The look on Guts face would be priceless.

You mention a "creator" in your title.  Does that mean this creator needed a creator as well?  And *that* creator needs a creator as well?  Is it creators all the way down?  &gt;If something exists, it came from somewhere.  Suppose that is true.  Why couldn't the universe have been created by some natural force or quantum wave or something.  Something completely not conscious and it just happens to explode everything into existence when there is nothing around.  Why isn't that an option?

Well if that's the case that's silly, but I guess I was talking more on principal than I was on this exact situation/location. A mass Tesla event should probably use all of Tesla's space before they descend on a neighborhood that wasn't setup to have MLS soccer sized crowds in them. If no other ICE cars came to fill those spaces it may only be because *those* cars were at the Dunkin Donuts, et al, which isn't good/fair either.

I don;t know why I'm sudenly seeing 505 kills everywhere. I could have sworn it was around 300 confirmed, and the extra about 200 were unconfirmed/propaganda.   I trust the Finnish numbers more than the Russians, though. Soviets seem more likely to sprinkle some propaganda on their kill counts.
The French Navy would like to remind the British that if pressure increases in the North Sea, the small 1e Fleet, posted off the Dutch coast, could easily move north to assist.  [just a couple of dreadnoughts and a few smaller ones but every little helps]
You have been banned from /r/CreepyPMs. No victim blaming! Safe space for all!
Can't speak to why they suspended a vehicle, not the license, but to get it out of the impound lot you'll need a letter of authorization from your Dad. Check their website, you need a few different documents (I went through this a couple weeks ago). They won't be able to help you with fines or any of the legality, but can probably tell you who to talk to (the police).  The impound fees add up fast, so good call to try and get it out asap.
Thanks! Oh man if I could make this thing move.

Yeah, my state has good rules. I'm lucky the things I like to make (and know how to do) are on the approved section. My state has a limit of $20,000/year gross sales. I think that's where having a part-time job for added security would help. I have a friend who does that with her art; she sells animal portraits at farmer's markets and then works in an office. It's interesting your state allows the homemade jams; mine doesn't allow that or fruit butters or the meat/cheese in breads.
I knew it was a joke from the title like well he's just releasing a new EP it's highly unlikely for this to happen now (or ever) yeah... uhm, i'll go cry, brb

You have a really bad understanding of how the law works dont you?

What possible way coould you come up with to win that case?
Wow I wish I had gotten a chance to play it that sounds like a really neat concept. My parents owned literally over a thousand movies when I was growing up, they still have about 90% of them, so I can just imagine how happy little me would've been to grind those out for some ultimate monster.

I meant the kidnapping of children.

Well, if you're into Earth, you've probably already heard of Sunn o))). Check out *Monoliths And Dimensions* or *Black One* if you haven't already.   Melvins' album Lysol contains some great guitar drone. Check out [Hung Bunny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwaWpUcTPMk&amp;list=PL81955C99AEFD03AD)  Boris' albums *Absolutego*, *Flood*, and *Feedbacker* all contain lengthy drone tracks split into multiple parts.  If you want something totally different, check out Stars of The Lid's *The Tired Sounds Of Stars Of The Lid*. Much more ambient than the previously mentioned stuff. It has a very quiet and light sound I guess

That's what I fear. I would like speech to be my field, but without those issues on my day to day. I feel like a horrible person saying that; I hope you do not misunderstand me.   Maybe I could do great in research and so on, but I understand that's an unlikely destination for anyone in higher education given the few opportunities.

Because AMC is a lost cause for ranked sadly. You can't adjust him without making him broken. If you buff his speed then he's too fast. If you buff his dmg then he's too strong. He's just not a great ADC kit wise in conquest while Artemis has potential with a build in CC immune ult and attack speed/ movement steroid. Plus she's Bae so that too.
Which, by the way, if you haven't seen his BRILLIANT series "If You See God, Tell Him" then you need to rectify that as soon as humanly possible.

In terms of progressive law US is extremely backwater, just supersaying. It IS, in your "explanation" u just made my point for me. "This *typically* includes sexual activity between people in a consanguineous relationship (blood relations)(...)", I'm done. If you still want to continue saying BS go right ahead. But don't try to force feed your believes as facts. I'm off, you clearly imperative in your beliefs and it won't matter how many times i call BS on them. Just don't think that anyone believes in you.
You can text me.
Yeah we do know how many poor kids there are. You don't because you don't have the slightest bit of education in what you're talking about so you're using again using the number that best fits your purpose rather than the most relevant one. It's still really sad; eventually you'll realize wikipedia is a good source but it's not the definitive one when you insist on being as technical as possible.  http://www.nccp.org/publications/pub_1074.html  As a bonus this also goes into details about poverty and how being in poverty is still by definition not meeting the minimum standard of living.  The rest of that paragraph is just nonsense. It is incredibly obvious that what you actually just said is you're going to disagree no matter what if an example is actually posted. You still have absolutely no authority to decide if what people spend their money on is appropriate and the fact that you even tried even further shows how little you understand the problem. All that matter is whether somebody can pay their bills on a minimum wage salary.   And since by your own source you admitted that people still do die every year due to starvation and the other lack of basic necessities it really is a joke that you're still trying to derail the argument. Unless you're actually trying to argue that those deaths are entirely playboys getting lost?

The problem is there always will be the bad eggs. In all honesty about 80% of webpages now IMO have pretty unintrusive advertising.  Issue of course is people turn them on for the 19% that have annoying adds and the 1% of ads that are loaded with malware. The real issue is that there's absolutely nothing the 80% can do about the 20% besides either put up a "turn off your adblocker please" note, or a "turn off your adblocker or you can't load the page".

My hair is more of a lob so the front sits on my shoulders but my hair hits right at my neck. I have soooooo many cowlicks that were at the base of my neck. I could straighten the spots at my neck and it would stick straight out. Which is why my stylist suggested the undercut.   It's been a week and I adore it. I'm hooked for life. I even asked my stylist if they think we can got shorter. We cut enough for me to get the feel of it since I was worried. Now I'm like buzz it all underneath for all I care this is amazing!  If I had the guts I'd get a shorter hair cut and buzz all around my neck. Sadly I have a chubby face and bringing my hair up past my jaw or right at it is just... no. It's a horror film where I want to grab a bottle of wine and cry.   Like you said though cool and tidy. It makes fixing my hair sooo much easier to fix and deal with.

Interesting idea finding comps for a guy who has yet to play one MLB game. I mean you never know. He could be Tony Gwynn or a complete slouch. Only Tyler White can tell us how he will perform. 
Exactly. No way he can win. He's making a lot of noise now because he's a fucking trainwreck. We're hearing about him like we heard about Britney Spears when she was shaving her head and flashing her cooch.   Trump is just the political version of a cooch shot. No way he can win. 
Ryu on the tier list is very debatable. Some think he should be as high as 3 based on theory, but not everyone agrees with him being so high because of his lack of current tournament results.

Dominant left, most algs use R moved which is most comfortable to reach with the left hand, so it would be easier to go left hand instead of having to convert algs when using the right hand. However both hands can become fast, dominant or non dominant.
That all makes sense.  Simply saying that the Royals are not as good because they did the least to improve does not. I, for one, am not concerned about losing Holland.  He had almost nothing to do with last years success.  His supposed....and eventually obvious...decline was a talking point among Royals fans for most of last season.  I hope he bounces back to be better than ever, but he really did not contribute very much to the Royals success last year...particularly late in the year.  As far as "overperformed their base runs last year" goes, I don't even know what that means.  It seems to me that they got exactly as many runs as they got, whatever that was.  Could you enlighten me?  *I'm guessing that "base runs" has to do with a ratio of total base runners to runs scored....is that it?
Unless you're big and threatening, don't mess with the people who are big and threatening.  Do not touch antlers or horns unless permitted by the owner.   Be wary of food sold at gas stations.  The subway system is usually overwhelmed from 8-10am and 5-7pm on weekdays, so don't bother.  Conversely, the subway is virtually empty before 5 am and after 11pm, riding then allows you do possibly talk with fellow riders but also puts you are risk of becoming a victim.  Finally, if you're feeling disillusioned with city life, head about 40-50 miles out to a small town. People are usually friendly there and things are a lot less overwhelming.

La disposición constitucional existe desde 1857, lo que no existía es una ley reglamentaria.   Ahora, si bien es cierto que por fin se obtiene una ley reglamentaria hay también una preocupación cierta de que dicha ley otorga poderes casi unilaterales al presidente.    Se podría haber hecho la misma ley pero con algunos contrapesos en los otros dos poderes de la unión.

You said you thought she knew what was going to happen and then use this as the example: &gt; but we're here now, so let's enjoy it and face that when it comes.   This could be interpreted as having to "face" the long distance relationship.  Which is clearly how she took it.  I agree that a LDR the first year of college is probably not a good idea for either of you, but you need to be more straightforward and tell her you won't do long distance.  Breaking up now is the way to avoid the most heartbreak.  Continuing to date her and deflect about the future and then ending it a couple weeks before you leave will maximize heartbreak.  
What's the harm in starting now?
Tesla's *entire business model* is dependant on subsidies! If it weren't for government mandated subsidies, federal government loans to Tesla, and carbon offsets, they would have not made one single vehicle. This is the race they are in now... if they fail to deliver the Model3 on a scale that allows them to actually show profit before the buyer subsidies completely run out, they will more than likely have to buy a company that makes gas-powered vehicles to continue existing, or they will cease to exist. This has been laid out end to end in practically every major business journal. The odds are not in their favor right now. But the reddit circlejerk over Tesla continues unabated.

Israel does not need to control 300,000 Arabs, Palestine does.

&gt; If blizzard was randomly placing teams together based on similar mmr or rank, one would come to a conclusion that there is an equal chance for any individual to be the highest rated person on the team or the lowest rated person on the team.   One would be right on any given die role, but not over a large sample set.   Probability theory is a thing.  50 random die rolls may never net a single roll of 1.  It could also net 50 rolls of 1.  You are taking a tiny sample set and extrapolating (badly)
I agree that public health is very important. I think it's imperative to offer education on good nutrition and access to healthy food for all. The problem with public health efforts is that by the time research is being translated into actual messaging the research  is changing. Nutrition is a relatively young science. The first vitamin wasn't discovered until the 1930s. The advice that has been given, low fat diet mainly, has been highly detrimental to public health including the invention of industrial trans fats and our processed food system replacing fat with simple carbohydrates. Hello diabetes and weight gain. Hi, insulin is released when the body senses sugar in the bloodstream. Insulin is an anabolic hormone, read fat storage. Replacing fat with carbs makes people fat.   I'm ranting. Focusing on weight has led us to the assumption that consuming a diet high in fat, 9kcal per gram in a lab, will make us fat. You hear people say it all of the time. "Eating fat makes you fat" this is simply not true. The association of fat with heart disease has led us to believe that eating a diet high in fat causes heart disease. (Fat from an avocado is different than fat from a Big Mac) Dr. Nissan, cardiologist at Cleveland clinic- one of the top hospitals for cardiology in the US, is back pedaling on this once accepted advice to limit fat to fend off heart disease. I guess I'm just spouting all of this to show that what we think we know about nutrition is not fact. It's theory and so far our theories haven't been very good. Notice the increasing obesity epidemic since  we started focusing on fat and weight?

That was poorly worded on my part. I didn't mean the time Adnan showed up, but rather the time beyond which the coach would likely have noticed Adnan's tardiness. In other words, I believe the coach might not have noticed if Adnan wasn't at track at 3:30 or 3:45, but if 4 o'clock rolled around and Adnan was still not there, then he would probably notice.

Giant Bomb does a weekly stream every Friday called Unprofessional Fridays that you may want to check out. When I was first getting into GB, I checked out the podcast because Stitcher played it after an episode of Indoor Kids. I thought it was alright but only kept it on because I was driving. But something clicked when I watched one of their streams. It takes a while to get used to everyone's personalities, and watching them interact while playing helped for me.  And hey, if it's not for you, no harm, no foul.
I feel like SLPs do make more. But you can live very comfortably on what a BCBA makes. Also, there are SLP masters pre-reqs that many people don't have.   The question is: What do you want to do? There is some overlap between what an SLP does and what a BCBA does. Being in one job with a background in the other would be a huge plus in certain situations. But what exactly is it that you really want to do? You'll be happiest with a job that you enjoy.  In home treatments aren't the only options for BCBAs. I work in a school setting. I work from 8-4 in one location. I know others who work in clinics keeping similar hours. Yes, many do in home stuff. But you can find a niche for you...  The question again is, what do you want to do?

Crown of curses and use the proto chest to guarantee either a Blood hammer, launcher or cannon by either putting one of those in the chest beforehand, or by save editing.  I assume you want the Ultra level as Skeleton achievement. In that case make sure that the first mutation you get will be something that can assist you in surviving the palace. (given that you transformed before killing all or most of the enemies in the labs).  Rhino skin or long arms if you have the Blood hammer will work in your favor. Trigger fingers as well if you have a reliable secondary such as assault slugger or Plasma cannon for example.  Good luck.

When you're trying to attract birds to your backyard, squirrels just ruin the party. They can empty a feeder in minutes, cause damage to feeders by chewing and clawing them to get to the birdseed and they scare the birds away. If you want to feed squirrels, that's fine. But they should be fed from their own squirrel feeders far away from the bird feeders. Even that won't stop them from coming after the birdseed though. Greedy little bastards.

Did you call HTC? Sounds like this issue didn't quite reach "widespread" status till it hit the US as it seems a very large percentage of Chase Visa's were declined. When I called today they already knew what I was going to ask as soon as I said the words "chase visa", I would give their E-Commerce line a ring if you haven't already.

For movies, I just download whatever is the highest file size non-3D 1080p copy on my private tracker... except not full bluray rips, I'm not downloading 40+GB files... Just a high quality encode is fine, usually is about 10-15GB for most movies. Sometimes more. My tracker acts as the filter for me... garbage encodes aren't allowed, so I don't have to worry about knowing names. They know them all for me.  For TV I usually just grab the first 720p on site, which is usually a few minutes after it finishes airing.  Yify was great for what he (they?) did. A lot of people really don't have fast internet, or have caps, and don't worry about quality. Yify was great for those people. Personally, I have great internet, no caps, and I definitely worry about quality.

This is a bad idea. Have a look at the first entry in [this list](http://matadornetwork.com/change/7-worst-international-aid-ideas/) for some reasons why.  It's much better to just give money, allowing necessities like clothes to be bought from local suppliers, thus supporting the local economy.   Buying clothes at western high street prices, that were probably made in China to ship to some other part of the world doesn't make any sense.  Edit: I read some of your other replies and see that you want the stuff to go to refugee camps. I still think it is better to give money to a good charity and let them decide how to spend it. Buying new clothes off the high street is not cost effective and you may not be buying the things that are most needed.

And that's why I support piracy to an extent. I say it right in my post. But when there are options to get free and/or cheap access to nearly all the music you can handle, there's no reason to pirate music. At that point, you're doing it to spite the industry.

Guy walks into Autozone, says "I just rotated my tires like the mechanic said and now it just doesn't feel right when driving down the road". So employee walks out and immediately notices something wrong.  Employee says "sir, did you do this yourself?"  Guy says "yeah, why?"  Employee says " well, when you rotate your tires, you shouldn't turn them around and place them back on, you really just need to move the front tires to the back and back to front.   True story!
I like Zib, upon pulling him I can do NB10. (I use Hwa(Lead) zib, colleen, adrian, bella) You can use him or Shihwa interchangably, depends if you want dots or brand and if you need more damage or more reliable debuffs (leader skills attack or accuracy). If you've already 6*d shihwa then use her. Fuco is nice, I wish I had fuco, my hwa is fast for other uses but adrian's speed buff and revenge runes makes it a non issue.

&gt; Now Daniel Mahaffey is hoping he can effect some change in the law with his own story. He’s written his state representatives and the presidential candidates, telling them about the loss of Fox, and the “inhumane” law that he says multiplied their pain.  Sadly Mr Mahaffey, Texas lawmakers don't care much about your (and your wife's) pain. What a horrific experience to endure. I think I'd have gone stark raving mad and threatened suicide in hopes the pregnancy might be deemed life threatening. 
As long as we agree that for people who want to drive, which happens to be the majority of the population, this makes their lives worse. Most people wouldn't be happy to go grocery shopping via transit. Most people wouldn't be happy to buy a bed via transit. Or a computer via transit.

I picked this up off your feedback and I've spent a little time in Prio - surprisingly good. I was planning to give this bundle a miss until I read your comment but this game impressed me with its professional presentation and simple visual language. I'm not such a fan of being shot at, as it stressed me out more than the first few levels suggested, but I'll definitely be coming back to this one to give it a proper run through.

What is it about the management overhead that's having you decide to move from two accounts into one?  There's lots of advantages to running in multiple accounts; cost allocation for untaggable services being just one.   In my experience, if you're committed to collapsing to one account and want to do cost allocations as you've mentioned, you'll likely want to use a 3rd party tool that will allow you to externally tag non-taggable assets and/or do cost allocation based on different models (eg 60% of monthly Cloudfront charges go to dept A, and 40% to dept B... Or equivalent percentage of EC2 monthly costs should be applied to Cloudfront to account for their usage).

Googling that question reveals ten or so posts on other sites asking roughly the same question. The answer is that it's a civil violation (like a parking ticket) not a criminal charge so no you don't have any pending criminal charges.

Thank you. Love hearing this.
I totally agree with the spirit of the argument here, that HIllary does and has taken money from the fossil fuel industry.  What she would argue is that it's not directly from the fossil fuel industry, ie through a super PAC or direct from company, but from individuals who have worked there.  Unfortunately, for that argument, one would, in spirit, have to separate the money made in a company versus the money paid by that company to its employees. So, HIllary accepting a donation from a pimp does not reinforce prostitution, because no one is directly having sex for money from her. She's just benefiting from it.  It's a thin defense and that's why vitriol is its standing argument. #IMSOSick of points made on minutiae and not in the spirit of logical causality.  There was also some ruling, or policy decision, and I tried to find it, but can't, from maybe middle of last year, in which lobbyists were able to not call themselves lobbyists, even as they worked for the company for which they were lobbying. It was a rhetorical challenge to proposals against lobbying. Back to pimp argument, "pimp" becomes illegal and he becomes a "companion," something like that.  All this speaks to the nature of the big, fundamental truths which Bernie is exposing, most notably, in this case, that campaign financing, governmental policy making, and thereby the rigged economy, are all grossly oligarchical.

I'm going to disagree.  I'm of Scandinavian descent, with family still in the area. My family (even extended family) is not like that. On the contrary, they're accepting of everyone. Once you married one of us, you were in the family.   I didn't experience exclusion until I married a Hispanic guy.

Staying at a hotel? Ask if there are any rooms on minor maintenance (bad a/c or television, needs paint, etc). They will likely dance around the question, as they would prefer you pay for a perfect room at full price. But also they know they're getting at least some profit on an otherwise vacant room.  Perfect for short stays when you're not spending much time at the hotel other than sleeping (or sex), or when you really need a room and they claim to be at capacity.
I just came across this and omg I'm wiping tears from my eyes from laughing so hard. I can relate to this on so many levels, you really have us "son stealing demon sluts" down to a tee.

I recently met thru Reddit, my precious little. We haven't met in real life yet but hope to over the summer.  We had been talking for a couple of weeks before we ventured into DD/LG but it has been amazing so far. Any advice from other Daddies would be greatly appreciated since this is all new to me. 
&gt;the political, economic, and social theories of Karl Marx including the belief that the struggle between social classes is a major force in history and that there should eventually be a society in which there are no classes  So Bernie Sanders doesn't believe that?

Yes! 
It's ironic hey.  I've had to work hard on opening up to people after everything. I've only just started being able to look beyond what people say and recognise insecurities etc and feel sorry for them rather than offended. It's weird moving from being angry at someone who is rude etc, to just detached.  It's amazing opening up to people though. It's a whole new world lol

Wages are preferred versus stock options and waiting on revenue.  The difference in size of wages and total revenue reflects one big and obvious reality. You want the business itself to continue to function, and without its own bank account it can be challenging to engage in the kind of commerce that makes modern life attainable.

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised to see Tesla adjust their manufacturing rate so that they his the 200k US cars at the very beginning of a quarter.  I can't imagine it not being worth a few weeks delay for a few customers to ensure an extra 3 months of tax credits for people. I think that would help their overall sales.  This is unless Musk has paid the right people and the credit will be extended once it expires.
I'm not a writer or producer so gaps in my ideas are to be expected. I really like most of what you've posted. My one point of contention is the idea that Ras has to be a part of the story.

I would check around the top left of device, right above the battery. That it where the WiFi antenna is and the connection to it. There's a double coaxial cable on the bottom side of the board in that area that is responsible for some of that connection. Since it works fine when the phone is apart it seems like something might be getting shorted out when everything is pressed together.

a. Buy all of the deodorant. You'll be in Yokohama, so you should be good for nostalgia food and what not. But man... deodorant... I don't know what's up with this country.  b. Talk to your city hall about it, since it varies by municipality. You'll probably get a packet when you move there and register. Mine has colourful pictures and a spreadsheet where I can look up what to do with a given item. Generally though, recyclables (including styrofoam) are separated from burnable garbage (like food waste). Those recyclables are broken up into a few categories, but it's really not that hard.  c. Eating out in Japan is very, very cheap. But remember that you are still eating out and probably not eating well.  d. I pay about the same as I did in Canada. Some things are cheaper and some are more expensive. But because I have less space, I buy more fresh food and generally waste less.  e. Speak. It really is that simple.  f. I believe that Yokohama is the second largest city in Japan, so there will be stuff to do.  g. Up to you.  Bonus question. Get in touch with any JET Programme participants there. Whether or not you like foreigners, JETs know a lot about their placements and can give you the run of the land, especially since any JET will have been there for at least 7-8 months now. They can help you get set up, act as a support group, and will give you a lifeline to not-other-university-students.  Your school will also help you with many things, so I wouldn't worry too much.

Everybody on this sub is just waiting for news about their order. Your post told everybody what they already know, but cluttered it up.
Easy solution buy a second one and judge from how well (or how badly) it's growing if it's not living up to your expectations buy a third,  Although I think 2 would do fine a 3rd would be about perfect (maybe a tiny bit to much for your tent size).
ok hopefully that'll work
The problem is that we know for a fact there are some victims out there. Maybe a lot inside our borders, but there is no definitive litmus test. I would like to do more than nothing, but what can you do? The only solution is long term societal integration, but that may literally take a hundred years with some of these communities. Compound that with mass immigration and you begin to see the problem.

&gt;tidying up a bit and putting some of her things less on display  If Wanda lives with her boyfriend, it's probably asking too much to clean up after her.  I try to be pretty tidy, but if I have a rushed day or something...and I leave my stuff around, I would absolutely NOT expect my partner to be responsible for tidying up after me :(  I'd also be uncomfortable if he put me "less on display," because to me, that's being deceptive about our relationship.

Actually, data suggests that 1) structure of wealth redistribution and policies and 2) cultural attitude towards redistribution policies play a role in determining redistribution's relationship to productivity. I'm not aware of any study (outside of something cooked up by the Foundation for Economic Education or some related institution) that suggests otherwise.
Just had this for the first time at the tap room in Lawerenceville, its really good stuff.
If you aren't attracted to trans people, then presumably you would never be in the situation of even considering having sex with a trans woman.  If you *are* attracted to a woman, and then discover she's trans, evidently you are attracted to at least some women who are trans.  Imagine you meet the girl of your dreams. She's absolutely stunning, has a personality perfectly compatible with yours, she's the kind of girl you have waited your whole life to meet.  Then she tells you she's trans, and suddenly you lose all attraction for her. Lets assume for the sake of argument that this woman is physically indistinguishable from a cisgender woman. Absolutely nothing that initially attracted to you to her has changed. But now apparently you wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole, when previously you would have crawled through broken glass for a chance with her.  Is that wrong? I don't know, but I will say it isn't exactly an admirable trait.  Replace "trans" with other demographics that are or have been despised and considered. What if the "dark secret" was that she's bisexual? Or Muslim? Or has a Mexican grandma? Or that she was raped as a child? Or had an abortion six years ago?   What would you think of a man who was suddenly repulsed by a woman they had previously desired after learning she's a member of a demographic they hold in contempt?  These aren't hypothetical scenarios. I have elderly relatives, white southern men who in their Jim Crow era youth would have been furious, likely even violent if they found out that a woman they had been intimate with was Jewish, or had a black grandma. They would have felt deceived and violated. Nothing about the woman they were with had objectively changed, but now they knew a detail of her personal history that made her repugnant to them.  Do you think people with non-white ancestry who could "pass" for white in the mid-20th century had a moral obligation to inform any potential partners that their grandma was black? Or that they're Jewish, in an environment where that could be a dangerous piece of information to disclose?  Were my uncle and his peers wrong to think that these women had a moral obligation to "out" themselves to anyone they flirted with, regardless of how much danger that might put them in?
Takeaway in North Wales had one a few months back. I was next in the queue and it was top of the pile in the till, so would have been my change from a tenner. But another customer saw it and she started ranting and raving about how rare it was, so the owner (who said he hadn't known what it was) put it aside and gave me the next paper note. I will never, EVER forgive her; she is dead to me.

99% of the time, you can transfer to any server. It completely bypasses the character creation lockout, but occasionally (very rarely) some servers won't let you transfer to them, unrelated to the lockout.  To answer your original question: Only Balmung is RP heavy. Other servers have small pockets of RPers but it's not widespread.

So you have one filter at 0° and one at 90°, because they're at right angles to each other 100% of the light is blocked.   If you add a third filter between the two at 45°, half the 0° light is blocked and half is 'converted' to 45° light. Then at the 90° filter half of the 45° light is blocked and half is 'converted' to 90° light.

Researching batteries will let you create accumulators.  The ideal ratio is 100 solar panels to 84 accumulators, but you can bring things down to 6 solar panels and 5 accumulators to get 83.33 instead, which is much easier to work with and also less than 1% off ideal.

As far as custom skins, riot doesn't care. No one else can see them, it's only client side so there's not really an advantage to be had
Although watching them isn't necessarily needed to understand Unicorn, watching the previous "main" instalments in the Early UC Timeline does help with some things and allows you to get some of the UC references and pointers made throughout.  In terms of why I'm watching them all, I never fully got round to watching Early UC as I got into Gundam via various AUs and was just making my way through the Early UC Timeline when the Unicorn expansion series was announced.

"Trump didn't understand the question, this isn't fair!" That is the same thing that is said every time he changes stances within a few hours, claims he doesn't know about something he just spoke of in a previous interview, or the time he was asked about David Duke.  How many times can that excuse be used before Trump starts coming off as incompetent? Imagine the ridicule for Sanders or Clinton from Trump supporters if they "misunderstood" questions as often as Donald does?
This is correct.

Don't even see how someone could make the comparison. You can argue that Eagles had the best o-line, run game, and deep threat that year. Combine it with an offense the league wasn't prepared for and you have a pretty easy job as a QB from there.  Cousins did well in any regular pro offense

I'd say to ask Christopher McCandless how well that works out, but you know how that ended...
The dialogue is pitiful and the gameplay is boring.
&gt;guys under 30 don't get that kind of exposure, or even many interesting roles.  true! Partly, I think, because men have so much more longevity in the industry than women. They can keep taking lead roles into their 50s while women are "too old" at 35. 
"And if he comes through, I guarantee he'll be a stronger Jedi for it...but it's a big if"  That, to me, makes it sound like its pretty certain he'll get his vision back at some point, and be a far more powerful jedi after said experience.

not saying i know anything about OP or the authenticity of the post, but look at Mozart-- it's possible, however farfetched.  also, nine-year-olds from 120 years ago didn't have tv, xbox, ipads, and ADHD pills... from my own personal observations nine-year-olds today are, sorry, but mentally stunted. hell, i know maybe 3 or 4 people *under 25* who have legible handwriting. and of course no one can do cursive anymore. you are correct-- it was a different time, and kids today may be able to program your iphone, but they can't do anything like OP's great-great-grandmother supposedly did. but i think this post may be more plausible than you think it is.

What a well reasoned argument you make! Why would anyone think a country that is the worlds largest exporter of oil and gas with the second largest reserves of coal have any power? It's not like they're the second largest weapons exporter with the third largest military. And they definitely haven't been flexing their muscles by taking over territories in Europe and bombing on behalf of a certain Middle East dictator.

broadly speaking, rubber guard as the closed guard variation, lockdown as the half guard variation, twister side control as the side control variation.  from those as the starting points, there's pretty deep wormholes to go down.

Every year, an immobile, mildly athletic at best, usually old quarterback wins the championship.  Every year, I hear the same bullshit about how Kaepernick is an amazing athlete.  Athleticism in a QB is about as useful as home run power to a starting pitcher.  I don't care how good of an athlete he is, he is not a good QUARTERBACK.
I'll just add you.  
First night on a cruise and ordered 5 plates of food from room service.  Woke up to 5 empty plates and had no memory of ordering or eating said food (no one else was awake when I ordered the middle-of-the-night meals).  That was the first and last time I took Ambien.

Building, machining and manufacturing things. Paintball guns mostly, but I have a lot of ideas, just don't have the equipment to build them.

I didn't say anything about the setting, just the gameplay. I like the setting and the humor, but based on the gameplay demos it really looks like repeating the same thing over and over with no depth.   I would love it to be awesome, but I think based on what's available now it's not worth it to me personally. It's also too bad they set it up so you have to buy it (if you want to use the coupon) before the Vive launches so most people can't try it themselves before hand.

Well, you have a lot to catch up on. Since then, 7 major releases have been released by Mojang along with many other more minor improvements to the game. [This](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Version_history) page has changes for every version. Just click on the version that was succeeds the version you just played and read on from there. **Note: Some noted changes aren't really for the average player**

Samuel L. Jackson in Django   (Everyone said his other Tarantino roles so I thought I'd add this one..)
Harrison Barnes has been one of my dream Sixers for a long time. I do think he'd end up being an overpay though.  Bradley Beal was up there as well but he's got injury concerns now and they do worry me a bit. I think I'd still go for him in FA anyway, that shooting would be great on our squad.  I'd offer Jordan Clarkson a contract as well. Nice scorer at the PG position and still has potential to grow.  On another note, Nic Batum would be a fantastic edition he's such a versatile wing player.
I think Butcher is a phenomenal writer so far. 
i always reminded people to relax and wait, but i fully understand your frustration. Just remember that the shipping dates were only to be expected, not promised.  But hearing nothing at all is intolerable. I think Oculus cannot say anything at the moment for whatever reason or at least they think so.  I am fully convinced though they are as frustrated and devastated as their customers are right now. For sure all they want is to get as many units in our hands as possible.
There's time for another two before they ship. Anything found in this weekend's beta can probably be fixed for launch, but if they find anything in the next beta it'll have to wait for a hotfix.  And they do have internal testers as well.  \*shrug\*
CCP naming rules prevent it. You could create a character with that name, but as soon as you pretended to be Mitanni they'd force you to do a name change.

Hanlan's Point is a magical place
That's pretty crazy. Some here may know that I have been asking around locations to move and apartment recommendations (found a great place in NW). I did a lot of research to find the place I ended up at, and in my research I found that there were many unhappy tenants at Equity and Avalon (mostly Equity). Avoided that shit like the plague.   Any prospective DC movers, I felt most comfortable with Bernstein though I did not move into a Bernstein building. Took a chance with a company that has only a couple properties in the city.

Do you seriously think the Clippers have a shot at making it out of the West?
Maybe.  I was on a road trip recently that had me see my fair share of deplorable gas station bathrooms.  I stopped in one real hole-in-the-wall looking place, and went in to pee, and walked into an oasis.  There were live plants, and pretty ornate tile, and a waterfall sculpture.  I commented on it to the cashier on the way out, and she said it was so nice in there that she hardly ever had to pick up anything up off the floor, and no one had ever written anything on the walls.

False. 64 bit can have information stored in less than or more than 64 bits depending on the language, declarations, and compiler settings the program was written in.

You're doing MoP and the Jade Forest but have no idea what is going on? Did you read the quest texts for the quests by any chance? The story for that zone is pretty great and involves some cool characters. If you have no idea what is going on, you either didn't read it or didn't pay attention. If you didn't read it, then what did you expect? That's the same as spacebarring through your SWTOR class story and complaining that there is no story.   I enjoyed the Jade Forest story immensely, I was playing Horde though. Not sure if Alliance is any good.

You are totally right. When we had DK2 shippings, they were shipping in larger quantities, and that wasn't that much in the first place.

Just to add, according to GSO, they should be given to anyone that asks for it, a pre order is NOT required, so don't turn down anyone if they don't want to pre order it.  Also you probably have to check their ID before handing them out due to the M rating of the game/beta.

&gt;I can see Mech being very viable now for TvT as thors will be able to put down ranged liberators that are currently the reason why it never happens anymore  I feel like the reason that Mech isn't viable is that you can't move out early in the game because you'll die to drops and later on the Mech army lacks the mobility to defend spread out bases to go into a solid late-game. The Mech player technically should have the Viking lead, which already deals with the Liberator problem. Might be wrong though, we'll see.

It's not just the references, man. It's the soullessness to the proceedings. It's the complete lifting of entire sequences from other films.

How many wanna bet this is an early April fools joke?
Dragged a fucking horse? I find that hard to believe.
All I have is my own anecdotal experience based on 650 hours of play and watching probably half of NL's Isaac videos since Rebirth came out, but I don't think "trademark Northernlion luck" is a thing. Proposing a mechanic for *how* he attains such luck is a pointless exercise until it can be shown to exist at all.
Oof look at that username

I know you're just here to troll and not provide any real input.. But he said "good" not "great". And I consider victories over ANY opponent to be a positive in the grand scheme.  
In the Headbanger birthday vids you could hear that too, first blamed it on nerves but Moa does seem to have the stronger voice
This sub likes its pizzas extra yeezy
Yep
Dance of death can be replaced by Violens. There's nothing wrong with it per se but Violens is more up to date with more features and fewer bugs.
Problem is these days every game thinks it can be league of legends with their business model. Launch f2p in hopes to attract a bunch of people but fails to deliver things people want to buy from the cash store, here is a good example i mean, you got these borderline p2w RNG scrolls fro the 3 hair slots and then what? Unless you're a whale and want to keep rerolling your decent rolls into better ones there's hardly any incentive to buy anything outside of the token. There's like what 2 costumes per class and a couple overpriced hairstyles, that's it. Cash store needs to be solid from day 1 with a bunch of cosmetics people WANT to get, and i'm not just talking about this game, pretty much every f2p out there.  Then they wonder why nobody buys shit so it goes to die off at gameforge or similar shady hosts and in comes the full blown p2w disguised as not p2w. (gamble items, currency exchange, sellable items, etc)  I kind of drifted away from the point, but what i mean is they can't even make solid f2p models that can sustain the long run and then on top of this it is a gold seller paradise which spoils the experience for everyone involved.  Niche games like this need to be b2p with an interesting cosmetics only store to generate extra $. Has side effect of keeping most bots and spam away.
The moment that seems to be able to change me and even the world Is always right by my side…  Try and guess
So many cities don't utilize the green wave. The premise is so simple, and if you are going the speed limit on the main road you only have to stop a maximum of one time no matter the number of lights. It also screws speeding since if you go too fast you're gonna have to stop at the next light.
Or even worse, onto the person walking in...
Short answer- NO. HELL NO. 
March is clearly Niko's month 
You also had one **s1mple** job, bro.
When people whine about Trump supporters being downvoted in this sub, I'll be happy to point to this thread.
it was there before I even commented...way to read.
Skeletons in particular have never had a shred of plot relevance in any DS game.  They are *literally* just a stock fantasy enemy used to fill space and give a little bit of verisimilitude instead of just throwing more hollows at you.  Amusingly they don't even really fit DS lore very well because of the whole way DS treats the word "Undead."
The past two years I have been lucky enough to get tickets on ticketmaster, but this year I wont be able to. Can anyone let me know how buying a ticket down the line is? Can you still link the ticket to your account or is it linked to the original buyer?
My wife and I use uber whenever we are on vacation.  It is always better than the local taxi service.  We would also go out for drinks more often if an efficient service like Uber existed.  We don't want to wait 30-60 minutes for an overpriced ride.  That is assuming that the taxi company did not forget us.  It has happened before.
For me 'taxes are theft' sure, but that simply means as you say that government has to be scrutinized and done with the utmost seriousness.  This means abiding by the constitution to me which we are far from unfortunately.  
Just stay away from it man :/ honestly. If curiosity gets the better of you just tread lightly
I like the way you work it (the field), I gotta bag it, bag it up.
are the mana games all you're interested in? really want rodea if there is anything I can do for that
He's in tonight?

I think your second suggestion is actually a kind of good one. It would help compensate for the larger group likely having better cohesion.
Amps help, you don't need a super expensive DAC to get the job done, there's a pretty big dropoff past a certain point, and that point isn't too high
The results per page is the number of HITs per page which corresponds to [this option](https://i.imgur.com/KI29XWY.png) recently implemented on mturk a couple months ago. Contrary to the dropdown options, you can have any value between 1 and 100. Based on your settings, you're scraping 300 HITs over 30 pages. You can get the same result by setting the results per page to 100 and reducing number of pages to 3. This reduces the number of page requests sent to mturk and speeds up the overall scrape.  The search by option is no different than the sort by option of legacy. It was renamed to avoid conflict with actual sorting methods from HIT Scraper--sorting based on TO.  Legacy used actual browser-level dialog boxes, locking the entire browser interface until they were closed, while this version doesn't. It's also a preventative measure against browsers ignoring all future dialog boxes which leads to confused users complaining that their block buttons don't do anything. The keybindings is a good idea, though. I'll add in the ability to use those in a future update.

If the dye system was like Gw2 I would buy them on occasion, otherwise they will never get a single sale from me as it is.

That's actually a [fake article](http://uproxx.com/webculture/no-a-man-did-not-go-into-a-coma-after-eating-413-red-lobster-biscuits/). Like that "blue waffle" bullshit a few years back.

There's no citation on that tidbit, so I'm afraid they made it up. There are subtleties involved, anyway. The SEP has pretty good protection against runtime attacks, but it is not tamper-proof hardware: on a "cold" (powered-down) iPhone, the SEP is off and can't monitor anything for tampering. Real tamper-proof hardware has things like battery-backed SRAM and tamper-detection meshes.  The Secure Enclave has a burned in UID key just like the main CPU does on all iPhones, and extracting both should be about equally hard (nobody has ever extracted a UID key from any iPhone as far as we know; it's designed to be unreadable by software). So really, the SEP doesn't buy you any real extra security against this attack scenario. On current iPhones, it's aimed squarely at protecting against rogue software on the main CPU, but it doesn't really have any features against hardware-based attacks, particularly any "cold" attacks like the NAND replacement (AIUI it does have encrypted memory to protect against a "hot" RAM attack). This could change in future chips, of course. Same with the anti-firmware-update stuff to protect against the "evil Apple" scenario: not possible in current chips, but with a few hardware tweaks and software support, something they could and should add to future generations.
I think men should be able to opt out of having to support the kid upon hearing that the woman he slept with is pregnant. The woman can then base her decision upon the knowledge that she will have to raise the kid alone if she chooses to keep it.   I don't think men should be able to force a woman to keep a child though.

I completed this one. Well designed!
Nice april fools
Or stress.

Attack Commitment  http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70079/?  Basically removes the ability for humanoid enemies to magically track you mid-weapon swing which makes dodging/moving kind of pointless. With this mod it changes it to a Dark Souls/Monster Hunter Style where once you being to attack you're committed to that attack and can't change the direction.
yeah...... they are all getting realeased this year, on a monthly basis. So now I play the waiting game.

I have the feeling that last game is approaching its conclusion, to be honest.
