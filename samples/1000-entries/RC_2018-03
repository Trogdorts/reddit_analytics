I think UC San Diego just did or is starting a football program in D-2, regardless, they would be perfect for D-1, P-5 football. * In the Pac-12, the non-CA schools want to play as many games as possible in California  * UCLA and Cal will never in a million years let SDSU or Fresno State or any other Cal State school into the Pac-12 (which kind of saddens me, I like SDSU)  * There are few good options for P12 expansion that doesn't involve Texas or Oklahoma (which honestly don't fit anyway and I don't want them). Maybe BYU, Colorado State, or UNLV??  * San Diego lost the Chargers so there is a relatively untapped market  * San Diego residents hate LA, so it's hard to count them in the UCLA or USC market.  * UCSD is an absolutely amazing location that could draw recruits.
You do realize how character credibility works right? So you believe Coke Head Jones? hahahahahahahaha okay
One of the reason is  that all the negative influences are brought upon by non-white people, so segregation means your kids will not be under that influence. 
He was a WASP, by the way, so I don’t think it’s a Cajun thing. My grandmother was Cajun and her side of the family had never heard of it. Not sure if that helps, but in Louisiana different groups can be pretty wildly varied.

I've been where you are. I used to get drunk every night to the point where I had visual snow and derealization every day at work.  If you want to stop I'd recommend switching drinking with weed. Weed is like 20x easier to quit cold turkey and it's easier to switch addictions than to stop altogether.  For me it wasn't necessarily the alcohol I was addicted to, it was needing something to look forward to. Work becomes bearable because you have a reward waiting for you every night, and that reward motivates you.  Ideally you go from alcohol to weed to finding something fulfilling that you can look forward to outside of substance abuse. That last step is obviously the trickiest.  Good luck friendo, if I could make it alone you can too.
So I have an eight-year-old daughter, and full disclosure I'm conservative and religious, and all the time time I see stuff about "YOU CAN'T TELL YOUR DAUGHTER WHO TO SLEEP WITH YOU CREEP YOU DON'T CONTROL HER VAGINA".  Then I see threads like this.
Which laws are you referring to?
Im quoting someone in this exact chain of comments. 
GHETOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That is required to be a Christian, yes, but you're not getting at the philosophical point.  What is God's *nature*?  The orthodox answer is that He is omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, good, and the being from which all existence emanates.  This also describes the God of the Jews and Muslims.  The being they worship appears to have the same fundamental nature, they disagree with us on particular aspects of the divine however.  In other words, they're a kind of heretic. If you proceed to deny that the Muslims worship the same God as us because of their denial of Christ's divinity, this being a sine qua non condition of the divine, then you must proceed to assert the same thing about the Jews whose conception of God is closer to Islam than to Christianity.  However, the Jews worship God as he revealed himself to His people in the old covenant.  If you say that this God is one of a fundamentally different nature, then you're committing something like the Marcionite heresy and denying that the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New are the same being.
sure, but i don't do anything above a1, so it's not really a useful purchase for me.
I would say something... But then again
"Granted, she only picked research which agreed with her preconceived bias and skipped over all the big words, but the love was still there." 
I don't agree that tl quality has any real relevance to response to licensing though. Or, at least, I can understand the reasoning, but I don't think it *should* matter.  Nor should duration of time spent on the tl matter either. 
Scotland and NI didn't vote for this though. Part of me hopes that wee nippy is just waiting for brexit to kick in and affect real people and offer an alternative, breaking away from England and rejoining the EU.   With an offer to current EU citizens in England and Wales to fastrack residency or something similar if they relocate.
No.

The issue you come up to in regards to the mentally ill part is that people's mental stability can change.  Someone who is fine one year may have serious changes happen in their lives that can lead to mental instability. Unless they are planning to do evaluations on a regular basis for gun owners, which isn't a bad idea.
&gt;Writing that only uses hiragana is for young children  As someone that is currently studying Japanese, you have no idea what you are talking about. Hiragana is what everyone uses in every day writing, and it is *by far* the most common of the three writing styles. Katakana is also used together with hiragana to make words stand out or for english words. These two writing styles dominate writing in japan.  &gt;There's nothing fancy about using kanji  Kanji is more official and is of course widely used and people know it but it is a pain to use exclusively because of the complex characters. Using only kanji in everyday life is most likely the definition of fancy.

If I got choked by my teacher I’m snitching, milking it to get all As 
Yeah, FC was one of the default extra options available that i just guessed on. It stands for fielding chances. I'm open to other options, I just thought it might be fun to mix in a fielding category to give it another element. I felt the same way about holds. I wanted holds because in my current league, we have saves as an option and I thought it could be a fun change to have holds and saves. I agree about the QS and win issue. In the current league, I was outvoted to just keep one or the other so in this new league, I'm trying to avoid having both in as well. I like SB the same way in the sense that it adds another element.
Even as a steroid it would be too strong unless it was a super limited one like a shot or two only 
So their musical identity is basically f(x) and SNSD? Uhm???  I know that today's artists will influence the next generation, as it has always done, but, SM has like, 100% creative control of Red Velvet (which is normal ofc) so the influence argument can't be used for that one - or if you're influenced by yourself I guess lol.   So they're taking the identities of two other groups, combining them into one, to get what? A machine that can do anything. Because ofc, huge props to the Red Velvet members for showing up big every comeback, they're versatile, but I would still argue that their musical identity doesn't exist.   It's fine to do a 180 every comeback, but like, you can't identify who you're listening to until you see the title, the visuals or ofc know the identities of the people behind the vocals.   Imagine if Coca Cola made a new bottle, with a new variation of their logo, design and so on, 2-3 times a year? Would they still sell as well? (Probably because it's fking Coca Cola, but you get the argument) Or is it in general a great idea to have one logo design and red colours?   It's nothing personal towards the members of Red Velvet at all, they're probably the most talented and entertaining idols at the moment. It's more a critique of SM.   Btw i've listened to kpop since early January 2014, not because I can see the relevancy of that information in this, but yeah.   But if you still disagree, then explain to me why it's a delusional opinion, why it's wrong that they don't have a musical identity and why i'm wrong in, that I think they're identity-less musically for doing 180 comebacks all the time.  If you don't bother, and think I'm just a troll, then it's fine. I accept that, but I would just find it hilarious how you say that Twice doesn't vary, but are in full denial of Red Velvet doing the same, in just another way.   Everyone has a bias and their groups that they like, but plz be objective once in a while.

Excellent.   But tbh I was kinda waiting for him to open his helmet.
Oh no. Lol I'm too slow for that. 
i don't "want" him to say anything. why are you so hostile? all i said is he should treat everyone equally. praise guys when they deserve to be praised. provide constructive criticism when they earn it. he played well. many others played far worse but he never calls them out on it because he has his blind spots. zaitsev was awful. nothing was said about that. he only provides the latter to a select few and give the gudpros a pass.

I miss Hitch and Carlin very very dearly and I wish they were still here in today's PC climate. Every single "intellectual" I've met has trashed Hitchens, and called him a bigot.

yeah thats true, I always play dota 2 or basketball to escape now that I think about it. But I personally wouldn't play a fighting game, losing in these just feels more unfun or maybe i'm just not comfortable enough in it.

&gt; DMs who could maim or permanently harm characters for "obviously bad" decisions that the players didn't know the risks of.  You would probably think I am this way then due to this story.  3.5, player was a catfolk.  The party entered into a magical cave via a ladder down, that had a moat at the edges of the cave.  Player decided he wanted to jump 15 feet across the moat onto a damp surface of just rock...  There were also massive amounts of crocodiles/alligators in the moat.  But there was an entrance way across the moat and he really wanted to jump!  Told the player it wasn't a smart choice, more than I am willing to say.  He made the jump though!  Even hung on!  But, trying to shimmy across 15 feet to the entrance, he lost his grip...  Guess what, I didn't take away the horde of crocodiles...  He was ripped to shreds but a NPC "saved" him.  Roll from table of random things that suck when you are revived from an evil character and he now loved the taste of rotting and fetid meat...  Know what my player did?  He laughed his ass off and we all kept playing with him having a new RP element...  Players and DM's should talk.  This penalty though is not huge and is fixable.......  Sometimes players need to stop thinking they should always succeed that way, when they do, it means a lot more.......

Football coaching and management positions seem to be the only job where people will ignore experience. Honestly our first team coaches are far more suitable to manage the team than Henry or Arteta right now. People want them because they were players and are recognisable but do not have any actual experience in the job. 
You are not wrong.

Nah, I haven't had anything like that happen. The only game I really play online is Fortnite, and I haven't run into any issues on that. Are you going through internet or ethernet?

I really don't know how to approach people like you anymore.   It doesn't personally benefit you to mock and deny climate change. It doesn't hurt you to accept it.

&gt;Failing to spur consumer spending  Incentivizing consumer spending over investment spending is not a policy that is good for the economy.  With consumer spending, you have resources being consumed, with no long term impact on economic growth. With investment spending, you have products being developed that can improve the economy in the long term.  The wealthy don't keep their money under a matress, they invest it, or put it in a bank account where it gets loaned out, which does spur consumption for things like cars, home construction, business loans, etc.

I recommend reading the diseases of humanity - psychoanalysis (Kränkungen der Menschheit in - eine Psychoanalyse)  It is only a few pages but worth reading. (:
All of these are valid points, but for me it's a lot simpler than all of that. Owen communicating with 'Blue' and having some kind of weird, audience-pandering relationship with a fucking prehistoric savage predator is totally asinine. The idea that the dinosaur recognizes and trusts him is beyond stupid. And we can already tell from the new trailer that there will be a lot more of this nonsense.

Without reading the article, that has to be Chris Cilliza.  I'm sorry, but that writer is totally unprofessional in my opinion. I'm not saying he's wrong or not funny in most cases, but I've seen a lot of ridiculous headlines written by him.  His content is always on the front page of CNN, too. I think they could find a better Editor-at-large for such a huge company. But one thing is for sure, he probably generates a lot of clicks.
yessssss!!!
Riley Reid, we would fuck obviously
Haha right, you had to unblock me.  Wow I really got to this guy.  Also, the guy who accuses someone of having no manners for saying the word "duh" has now said "fuck you" twice. Dizzouchebag.
I've ordered multiple times, if seized (highly unlikely) just contact the MOM they'll send out a replacement. 
Also this admin lies about a ton of stuff. I wouldn’t trust their word that the toilet paper they use is white without verification. 
Sometimes, some sentences need **emphasis**.  Aren't you ***aware*** of typographic **emphasis**? For one, I do prefer *italics* for that purpose though.
Yes... but I'm not telling.

I read this as "trying to gaslight us into believing their nightmare." and didn't think twice until I reread the word. still accurate.

It’s was an inflated example but compared to how people socialize and the population of the game it’s not that far out.

I like /u/dj_soo 's suggestion but I'd personally probably find the folder they're all in and make three folders: keep, trash, and needs a proper listen.  Just start at the top and drag these into their respective folders and the list will slowly decrease in size. If you have dropbox you can even do this from your phone (there's a dropbox app).  Then what I do for organization is genre&gt;artist&gt;song but whatever you like you can do the same "make a new folder and label it" and as you come across things that don't fit into any folder make a new one. You'll eventually end up with a tree of organized songs and then you can label them properly when it gets down to a few folders of a few hundred songs instead of one folder with thousands. Makes it easier to break up the otherwise daunting task.
Haha I couldn’t help myself lmao they’re getting real angry
What kind of a post is this? You know nothing more than the people saying that he did win. If he signed up with his personal twitter account then there's nothing to stop him from winning the contest. Both arguments are just speculation so why make this thread?

The kid(s) that accused me of molesting them. It was always fat shitty Mexican kids. Dumbasses thought they could threaten me with that bullshit, they never showed up to class let alone tutoring, how could I pull a move idiot?   Another accused me of assault after a tried to grab his phone from him and the case came off lol. Worst part is parents always back up their little angels 100% (in my experience it was always very racist and highly uneducated people sadly).  Teaching in a poor district just isn't for me, the good ones are silent and forget you after the year.

As someone with no interesting life, I just end up asking the following things and sometimes it brings up an interesting topic to discuss.   If it's a Monday, I ask what they did on the weekend. Tuesday to Thursday, I ask if they did anything interesting last night. During Fridays I ask what are they planning on doing on the weekend. Rinse and repeat every week.
Even oda doesn't know how to defeat kaido yet and said something along the lines of it not being luffy able to punch him really hard. He said that would be a disservice to the fans. Even monsters like kaido usually have humble beginnings. I think oda might contrast him with Biguu Mamuu since she was a monster since birth while kaido only became one.
what is taxable then in your opinion?
For some reason I've always had a fascination with diapers and a desire to wear them. As long as I can remember. I had a super abusive childhood, maybe all the trauma caused me to use it as a comfort. As a teen I made a couple diapers out of towels etc, and felt super disgusted with myself.. eventually when I was in high school I got up the nerve to go to rite aid and buy Depends. I loved wearing them so much. About that time I discovered abdl porn. It was one of the skymouse sites I think. I've been buying diapers online and wearing and enjoying them without guilt for probably around 12 years haha. My wife and I play with them in our ddlg dynamic at home. Now she's the main wearer. 
It's a movie that has stood the test of time for me and never left my mind. The more thought I put into it the more I get out of it, more so than any other film I've seen. There is no definitive best movie, but in my mind it's the best film ever made [although it's second to my favourite of all time, Stand By Me].
His Pale Emperor album is one of my favorites.

I experienced this quite a bit when I was exhausted and attributed it to narcolepsy. Now, years later I have a pair of prescription glasses that I wear for distance and a pair for computer usage. Since I have been wearing my glasses the occurrence of tired hallucinations has decreased drastically.

Daily i3 driver here, drove a 2018 Leaf last week, quite an improvement. A couple years ago I test drove an i3 then went across town and drove a Leaf then promptly went back to the BMW dealer and signed the papers.  With the new Leaf it would have been a much tougher decision. 
Many casual and semi casual guilds will break at AQ40. You can't carry scrubs through there. Genuine prep is required (NR gear) and paying attention to mechanics. AQ40 will show who is ready for naxx and who isn't. 
It is 100% ok to set any boundary you want as far as what your boyfriend can or can’t see. However,  not getting to see boobs ever would be a dealbreaker for me (but then I’m kind of obsessed with them). I think so long as you clearly tell him that this will always be a rule for you, or that it will take a few more months for you to get confortable - then everyone has all the information they need to make a decision.  Even if you guys are perfect for eachother, if a large chunk of his sexuality revolves around breasts and breasts will never feature in your relationship then that makes you sexually incompatible and you should possibly cut your losses

I kept telling myself that the voice I kept hearing wasn't mine  In fact, it was easier to convince myself it was that of my parents. And once I did that and realized how toxic they are in my life, I kicked them out of it. I feel better now. Not sure how long it will last or anything, but like...I dunno, it feels better now.

Net neutrality is the government ensuring neutral ISP practices.... 
Retro Studios already existed long before the buy-out was finalised - and Metroid Prime released just two months after the Rare purchase; safe to say Retro would likely have still replaced Rare as Nintendo's top 2nd party developer, given Rare's rampant failures and management struggles.  The only good thing from Rare being kept ahold of would be that Nintendo (as 100% stakeholder) would gain full rights to Banjo, Joanna Dark, Conker etc - and would likely have aimed at salvaging these franchises even as Rare continued to degrade.
"who what when where and why, do I intend to WHAT do I intend to find..." I still remember that mad song.
This challenge is interesting.  It makes random encounters a dreadful experience, because even in encounters where the characters are fighting against each other and don't notice your presence, an accidental critical hit can end your run.  Let's say you find Hubologists against some punks. Some Hubologist members are equipped with hi-tec grenades. If you're near one of these punks, say adios to your character.  I makes the game even more similar to a real pen and paper RPG (the ones without magical revival items, I mean).

Hrmmm how do i put this. People respond to different leadership types. There is no one shoe fits all. There is a lot of Lakers who flourished under kobe and got fat contracts and then fell off because maybe they were missing that extra push(shannon Brown comes to mind). Then theres people who under the same set crumble under it(kwame).   Its a weird thing and no one knows how things have played out.   I know i got amazing at my job because i had a super hard ass ride me everyday no homo. He would see my lazy tendencies and whip into shape no problem. I think if i was under someone softer i wouldve abused them.  Idk im just rambling. Leadership comes in all forms and people respond differently is all im saying
[Nope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism). Libertarian comes in many, many flavours.  Edit: Although I'm not the most educated person in terms of splitting hairs on political ideologies, so maybe liberal (in the classic sense of the word) socialist would be a similar/the same ideology?  Edit 2: Thinking about my previous edit, probably not. And I did not use the term 'libertarian socialism' correctly in my initial post anyway. Whatever the term for people who believe in the freedom of the individual with plenty of social safety nets is what I meant.
Honestly, it takes an hour to create a map yourself and run it through osmcoverer_centers. Less if you go for a less dense area.  I think I managed to get all of Manhatten and some surrounding gyms across the water mapped (600+ gyms) in under 2 hours. The process can still be improved.  Spoofers will be able to do the same just as easily on any large city.

&gt;Right, but you can't sell a child. Also, a child is fully human under the law, whereas a fetus is no different than a body organ:  Those pesky human rights...   &gt;hence I feel like there are some similarities in the idea of selling your own body's organs vs selling your own body's fertilized egg / fetus etc.  Indeed there are similarities. But shouldn't the father give consent for selling the fetus? (I know that under our current discriminatory laws the father has no rights what so ever over what is done with the fetus but it stands to reason that he should be able to say something if his baby is to be sold to someone)
No plz

Just the look and the monsters, the music, when I was little like 5-7 I started playing the DW 1+2 on Gameboy Color, and on accident I got DW Monsters(I just liked the look of the box)  And I just loved the monsters, the colorful worlds, the music. I sucked at them, never got far. But I loved playing them, just exploring. DW Monsters 2 was my favorite because of the different worlds you got to visit.  I'm 23 almost 24 now, so this series has been with me for almost a couple decaded by this point, and it's still that look, that certain feel the games have that have me coming back.  I've completed up through 6 so far, and I've got a playthrough of 7 close to complete, and I'm working on 8.  But yeah honestly what really probably hooked me, is the Theme. That bombastic music that sounds great coming out of anything from a gameboy speaker to hearing it well up in your headphones.  I don't know how anyone could here that amazing call to adventure wrapped up in a single song and not get entranced.

Live in the suburbs, somewhere between your job and Chicago.   I used to do the reverse commute, and I hated it. I would have to wake up early to beat rush hour traffic. Then after work, I would do all my errands and go to the gym near the office, so that I'm not dealing with the evening rush hour. Even with this plan, my commute would take anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes, since traffic on the expressways is highly variable. There's no way to anticipate it with high accuracy.   By the time I got home, I was way too tired from several hours of errands and a long commute, that I didn't have enough energy to really enjoy the social life of the city. Eventually I moved back to the suburbs, and I'm so much happier now.

Fallout 4 is not an RPG
No problem.  Based on my experience, if you are running the stock flight control (i.e. 1F; 1TB; 2DB) I would advise grouping your DBs to try and cause multiple fires on enemy ships - particularly Battleships.  Reason being, if a Battleship is burning in multiple locations, her captain has to make a choice:  * Option A - Let the fires burn and lose considerable health to the fires (noting the fire damage can be healed 100% by the repair consumable) * Option B - Put out the fires using the Damage Control consumable to conserve health  Either way it is technically a win-win; especially if Option B occurs as you can then try to score a flood on your target with your TB squadron. If you score a flood when the Battleship does not have their Damage Control consumable available, a single flood can cause huge amounts of damage over time (up to 60% of the ship's base health pool according to the WoWs Wikipedia).  You can pursue the same approach with the upgraded Flight Control (i.e. 1F; 2TB; 1DB), but keep in mind you have less DBs to work with in this instance.  I hope that helps. :)

Lebron leaving me in 2010. Didn't get over the sadness until he came back. I know this is a very cliche answer for Cavs fans, but people who grew up Cavs fans worshipped Bron and to see a hometown hero leave us... on national television... it was heartbreaking for my 12-year-old self. 
Thanks! I’ll try that out.

One time I was walking down the sidewalk, and to the side I saw this girl to the right, so hot I literally stopped in mid step and did like the full drop my jaw, stare, and practically drool - I think I said "wow" out loud.  Then "Oh My God".  But, I was headed somewhere with a couple friends and we were running late, so we started walking again. Sometimes when you have a moment like that, you might never see her again and always wonder - if I had just had the courage to walk over and say hi...  Luckily for me I saw her again later and this time I talked to her.  We had a thing, for a while, then it was surprisingly easy for me to break up with her - I guess we had never really connected and she had just used me to try and make an ex-boyfriend jealous.  It sure is better to have had a thing with her, rather than have always regretted not, for the rest of my life, because I surely would have.  I can always think back, and what I think is this: holy fuck, she was so god damned hot, and yet, not regret that we broke up.  If only ever boy could be so lucky as to have a memory like that...
Just like americans with their fake smiles, just be straight with me and flame me.

Wow.  Great argument.  That doesn't change the fact you have to be an adult to purchase a firearm from a legal firearm dealer.  An adult in this country is considered to be anyone 18 years or older.  Doesn't matter what "you start seeing" them as they are not kids.  The people you are talking about in your above comments "kids" would not be able to buy a rifle at dicks anyway.

I would swear by the heated blanket that my wife and I bought. Instead of spending energy heating a large portion of air in the room that we aren't occupying, it only heats up what we need. It's a heck of a lot more efficient that space heaters, and has kept our energy bills down this month.  Of course, you need to be stationary and near an outlet, which is why this is our couch solution. But it may be a cheap hold-over option for you while you consider some of the other things mentioned.
You don't have to max out a unit instantly, do you? And that's why large box space is important, you keep those evolvers and turtles you accidentally get from previous raids and FNs and you keep some for situations like this. You get turkeys and feast that will definitely accumulate overtime (i got like 5 at the beginning of this anni event from previous events) and you use that on Legends (or if you really, really, reeeeaally wanted it, on real good RRs though i highly doubt that's advisable).   Look at your friends list, you'll find people still rolling out legends on their 5 star form sometimes because they do want to test it out first before knowing how to build them, what sockets to use and etc. If you suddenly find people with 200cc, max lv and max socket, it means they have been keeping dupes in preparation. This game is that kind of planning game.

Hey man, iam not wiser than you, but this is something that i been thinking about lately too. And this verse i think can help you out: matthew 10:16  I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
It goes beyond just having a *right* to bear arms. In case any of you were under the mistaken impression that Jesus's central message was love, Rev. Sean Moon (the pastor of this church, "World Peace and Unification Sanctuary" in Newfoundland, PA) wants you to know that it wasn't. It was guns. Guns were the *center* of Jesus's message, according to Moon.  In the video below you may be able to tell that he is wearing a crown of bullets.  6:22 "The CENTER of the Kingdom of God is the crown, land ownership, and GUNS, the AR-15 assault rifle, the rod of iron."  7:25 "Gun owners are the true Christians."  7:38 "They are the ones who are the center of the Kingdom of GOD, not these moral posturing little prima donna glitter-bug ministers who just like preaching about love, but never about the rod of IRON! [fist pound on table]. You say, oh yes, we support gun ownership because it's a constitutional right of America, and they serve a utilitarian purpose if we get attacked. No, you pieces of trash, you stupid idiots, It's the CENTER of Christianity. It's the CENTER of Jesus's own vision for his kingdom."  8:48 "God has revealed the true christians in these last days... They are the ones who--maybe not even go to church--but hold fast to their guns, they know spiritually, something in their soul, calls them to it."  This 10-minute video segment was taken from "The King's Report" broadcasted on February 6, 2018. You can find it on YouTube under "A Call to All Christians: Take up your Crown and Rod of Iron."

I am not. I am an Ohioan, though I grew up on a farm, in a rural area where Howdy was not too uncommon.  The girlfriend's parents are both alumni/professors at A&amp;M, however. She indeed taught me the Texas etiquette of returning a "Howdy" and the history of "Gig 'em." I'm a WVU fan, but if I were to choose an SEC team, it'd definitely be A&amp;M. In fact, I saw the last 2 games vs LSU at Kyle field. That atmosphere is unlike anything else I've encountered.  Also, I'm a Browns fan. So thanks for Myles Garrett, but not so much for Johnny Manziel.  So, to you, friend, I say Gig 'em. 
While even the insert pamphlet says not for long term use, I do agree that they can be very helpful in getting through a rough patch.   I was on pristique for about a year in 2009 or so and it really helped me when I needed it. I routinely had suicidal thoughts and although I never made any attempts, I was in a very dark place.   The medication helped me not because it made me happy, but because it allowed me to live a normal life without constant darkness. Thus when I stopped it, I was able to continue my healthy lifestyle that had developed as a result of living without darkness for a year.  There may be naysayers but I'm happy you're doing what's best for you. I encourage you to start living the life you couldn't see before. The meds will help but it's still up to you to make the changes that will allow you to wean off when the time is right. Don't let anybody tell you when that time will be though. Only you know yourself well enough to make that call.

It wasn't that long ago I would've wanted to do this.   Now days, I'm just happy my bones are where they're intended to be..
&gt; Then fucking give it to us and quit dragging this out.  Detroiter checking in. Agreed completely. I was kind of excited at the possibility of an MLS team, even though I don't really watch soccer and I knew our bid was pretty weak. But now we're months after the first announcement deadline and I couldn't care less - I don't know anyone that still does. I feel like they're doing this for some illusion of suspense but it's just annoying at this point. Each city made their proposal and that's that.   I'm hoping Cincy gets it at this point, since it seems like you guys have the most-complete bid out of the finalists.
I don't mind spoilers, but I usually try to avoid let's play videos because it reveals too much gameplay, which can ruin your experience when you actually get to play the game. Knowing the plot isn't as bad as watching how to finish certain quests using certain approaches.  I think gaming is like reading books or watching movies. Yes, you know the ending of many movies, but you still have a good time when you read the same book or watch the same movie again and again.  It's better not to get stressed too much about avoiding spoilers. That might actually ruin your gaming experience in the long run. You should try focusing on the games you are currently enjoying and have fun!

I'm reserving judgment for now. Maybe having VR mixed w/ 2D is a good thing and a way of allowing the 2D subscribers to help fund the VR and *advertise* to them about VR so more people will be tempted to try it. I just don't like the idea of having to have multiple subs to get all of NA's VR content.
February felt like a slow month for samples. I have a few items that I am SO CLOSE to finishing but didn’t make my Feb 28th cut off.   Korres Wild Rose Advanced Brightening Sleeping Facial (Allure) – I love love love this. Love it. This is from one of the fall Allure boxes. I started using this and didn’t think much of it, and then I switched to something else for a week and something about my face was just off. This really does brighten my face, and my new skin was restored quickly when I started using it again. It has a pleasant smell, isn’t too heavy, but is a smidge greasy. I ended up with two of these from Allure, and went and found a few more cheap on eBay, and once I work through all of these I will probably purchase the full size version. I think the sample version is half the size of the regular one, and this seemed to last me quite a while. I was GENEROUSLY throwing it on my face before I realized how magical it was, and then started using it sparingly.   Origins Retexturizing mask with Rose Clay (Influenster) – I received this mask with a serum/moisturizer (should finish these in March). This mask was good. It does have a strong smell, but I liked it, it was refreshing and rosey. I enjoyed the pink esthetic among this – the package is pink and so is the product. It is also gritty. It was a good mask to receive for free, but not one I would probably purchase.   Tarte Empowered hybrid gel foundation (Tarte bi-annual box) – This isn’t from a monthly box, but from the Tarte Make Your Own Box promotion (they did it twice in 2018). This came out to like $7 or something. ANYWAYS. This is another HG for me. I really love this foundation, it’s a light-medium coverage and blends into my skin well. It’s a nice dewy finish. I’ve seen a lot of complaints about the packaging, but I’m a garbage person and it didn’t bother me to dig into a tub instead of a pump package. I would pay full price for this if I ever run out of foundation/BB creams, but I always seem to have a backlog of it, and for a couple extra $$ I can buy this during their build your kit sale, so I haven’t needed to just full on buy this yet.   Lancome Monsieur Big Mascara – I don’t remember which box this was from. Play? Allure? Ipsy? It doesn’t matter. I used this for a few weeks, it got really clumpy and dry and I put it in my “finished” drawer. A lot of it ended up under my eyes by the end of the day. Wouldn’t purchase this.   Vichy Mineral Serum – I think this is from Allure? This serum was fine. It didn’t have a smell. It seemed to do its job but wasn’t standout. I have another one of these that I will use, probably wouldn’t purchase this.   Various perfume samples – I love perfume samples. I have no need to purchase an actual bottle because I have so many samples (Thanx Sephora!).

I would definitely put them up at the top of the loyalist legions. They don't over-extend (with the exception of Dorn's attempt to kill Perty, but that kinda knocked some sense into the remaining fists when they rebuilt) and know their limits and never - ***NEVER*** give up. They are arguably the most well-drilled and cohesive of the loyalists in my book because all they do is train and condition themselves for battle.

I mean Ann's role/importance in the overall story drops quite a bit after the second palace, so I guess by effect yeah? I was personally never really bothered by it though so I can't really know how you'll feel.  The Kamoshida stuff is obviously intentionally gross, and her outfit is supposed to be empowering within the story (all of their metaverse outfits are meant to be their image of rebellion, and Ann's is about embracing your sexuality within a conservative society), but whether you'll take it like that or think it's an issue with the devs is up to you.  Other than that, Morgana continues to have a crush on her and be cringey about it, but I don't think he ever says anything sexual about her, and there's one or two comedy scenes with Ryuji where she teases him and laughs it off.   The only thing I ever thought was actually creepy was the whole stripping thing, but once they went super over the top comedic with it and made it obvious that Yusuke is just incredibly weird and isn't trying to exploit her, I never really thought about it again

The specs you provided are just the size but not the actual model of tire. However I’m guessing you’ve got all seasons....which means they’re not really great at anything but generally adequate year round.  Get dedicated summer and winter tires and I guarantee you’ll get better results as both will deliver better grip in their respective seasons
I just can't imagine being bullied by someone 2 yrs younger than me. I also can't imagine taking it out on other people years after I'd left the school. And I certainly can't countenance doing it with a firearm. Then again, I can't imagine giving someone who isn't considered old enough to deal with stress and anger in a rational way access to an assault rifle? Surely if they're "too young" to understand the significance of the 2nd Amendment, they're too young to own a weapon.

I live one county over from Baltimore, and let me assure you, its an even bigger shit hole than the news portrays. The people who live in the city are out of control, the cop corruption runs deep, and its a scary place to be. The whole living situation and dynamics of every day life just isn't okay in my opinion, and I have no idea how civilization could ever repair itself.  Like, what can you do when the city is broke, the residents are broke, and the justice system is effed up?  I feel sad for the people who have to live there and still want to call that city their home :(

**Libertarian socialism**  Libertarian socialism (or socialist libertarianism) is a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy.  Libertarian socialism also rejects the state itself, is close to and overlaps with left-libertarianism and criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of political organization. It asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28
We’ve hired 10,000 cops to carry in schools since April 20, 1999. They have stopped 0 shootings. They did build a nice school to prison pipeline though...  Yes, I agree. Putting guns on teachers is “actually insane”, which is why those people should be as far away from children as possible. We don’t need Rambo mentalities in our buildings. As a teacher, I can safely say 95% of staff will resign the moment staff carry inside the building.

The twist ending is that the kid flies away on his swan wings.

Not a sniper rifle. All weapons have bullet drop, in fact, the barrels are angled with the sights to compensate. An R700 will be above your aim point at 100m if it's zeroed for 300m.
&gt;Dokkan has quite a similar system, but there missions give a lot more XP making level up refills happen more often. Missions cost 30 Stamina for the most difficult quests and at level 200 you already have over 200 Stamina.  Uh, I'm level 352 in Dokkan and only have 150 stamina. In OPTC I think I had that much stamina at around level 260.  Personally I've played OPTC for a much shorter amount of time and ranked up a ton, and while you do use more gems for stamina refills it's because there's actually stuff to farm and do compared to Dokkan.  I do think the raids costing 60 stamina seem a bit high for the xp you get, but it's not all that bad.
Eh I never bought Austin being very smart so we have to disagree on that respectfully.  He is just overly book read that could speak in a way that sounds well, but if you listen to what he actually says half of it was empty and devoid of all content.  Or often just downright dishonest but pretending he knew what he was talking about.  Gosh when he started ranting about basic level economics, like introductory course stuff, as if he was some genius on it only to realize he didn't even understand basic concepts such as economic self interest or supply and demand made me realize that half of his stuff he says is ignorant sophistry that just comes across as intelligent.  I mean I am fine with him not knowing things about economics, but when he acts like he is some genius on it and starts lecturing the people on the podcast about it, and then he clearly has no idea what he is talking about on an even fundamental level where I think surely even he knows he doesn't know... something is off.  To me he was always the guy who seemed more like won a book reading contest whoever reads the most books this summer gets to be a member of GB for a year, and then only wanted to preach politics. Don't get me wrong, I think good communication is important and valuable.  I could improve it myself.  But I never saw him as smart.  Being able to quote obscure books and speaking with big words is not what makes a person smart.  His reasoning skills were utter garbage.  This him having a Bachelors in philosophy yet he couldn't even handle basic reason that you would get in a General Logic class from a philosophy department in a university. I sound aggressive in this, and I don't mean to be.  Just trying to show why I disagree.  But thats cool :) I mean this is just based on our own perceptions more than anything.  So no biggy !  Please don't take offense.

White Bear has always felt like a cult to me. Everyone there swears how amazing the town is and buys little polar bear lawn decor and paintings. While everyone on the outside goes "why the hell would you live there".   If you are looking at St Paul suburbs I could not recommended Woodbury enough. Stillwater is a little far out but takes all that is good about White Bear and multiplies it by 10.  If you are considering city life, the Northeast and Uptown neighborhoods of Minneapolis and Grand Ave in St Paul are great for 20 somethings!

I think some people still have trouble grasping the scale.   I like to start with something manageable but still impressive   Imagine each seed is a grain of sand in a concrete truck. How likely is it for two people to pick the same grain of sand if it’s tumbled sufficiently in between picks. Now how about all the sand on the Gold Coast of Australia? How about all the sand on Earth?  That’s already pretty big, but there are approximately 7.8 Quintillion (7.8x10^19 or 78 000 000 000 000 000 000) atoms in a single grain of sand, and there are more IOTA seeds than there are atoms in the **entire observable universe**.

&gt;what would be the difference between highest grossing actors and highest grossing directors?  It is extremely rare that an actor and director work exclusively with each other over the entire course of their careers...  Since you mentioned Titanic, we can look at James Cameron. He has 2 of the highest grossing movies of all time with Avatar and Titanic.  A quick google is only giving me 1 actor who was in both of those movies - [some guy I've never heard of called David Warner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001831/)  So Leonardo DiCaprio isn't going to get Avatar added to his total gross, and Sam Worthington isn't going to get Titanic added to his gross.  So you can see how the Highest grossing Director, and Highest grossing Actor will very easily be different.  &gt;Is passenger #458 in Titanic also one of the highest grossing actor  I've never seen a "highest grossing actors" list that includes extras, and even cameos are usually excluded (which would knock out Stan). I can see how you could argue that you should technically include cameos, even though I tend to think those lists are a bit silly, but including extras work in there is definitely too much of a stretch.

La mancanza di una chiara idea su quale sia il “lavoro dei sogni” è molto più comune di quanto si creda. Rimuovendo i classici, ovvero calciatore, astronauta, etc che si sogna da bambini, non è neanche facile avere un lavoro dei sogni o più realisticamente un’idea di cosa voler fare nella vita. Un 20enne oggi ha molta più scelta e libertà di manovra rispetto al 20enne di 50 anni fa, ma questo provoca anche l’indecisione data dalle troppe scelte possibili. Aggiungi a questo che in Italia si chiede di scegliere quale lavoro svolgere ben prima di averne fatto alcuno, quindi di aver magari sondato cosa piace e cosa no, e fai bingo.  Mi spiace non poterti essere d’aiuto anche perché è un problema che mi tocca personalmente. Best of luck.  *Magari se arriva a una decisione fammelo sapere, magari aiuti pur’amme*

C/C pens are also far easier to fix if something goes wrong than any other type of pen. Think about it- how do pens break? It's pretty much always the filling system or the nib. Filling system breaks? Buy a new converter for a few bucks. No sending your piston in for repairs by the manufacturer and model specific parts, no sacs, just an easy part to buy and replace in 30 seconds. Nib breaks? Same as any other pen. 
Daenerys sat with her feet in the water, like she might on any usual day at the Water Gardens, only this time she had a rather chubby baby in her lap who was giggling and reaching for the water while she attempted to keep him upright. Periodically she would dip his toes into the pool and he would squeal with delight or kick and splash, making her dissolve into giggles as well. It was lovely to have a baby again, now that Oly and Morgan were big.   She smiled at Maron when he came to sit next to her. "Careful, you may get wet," she advised, as Aemon splashed insistently.

I would tell her that if she can prove that there is no child abuse problems and that all the media coverage is 100% lies then you will happily join the flock of God in the one and only organization that benefits from God’s blessing.   But until all the pedophelia is proven to be false news, it troubles your conscience to associate with a group that has so much criminal activity going on. Criminal activity that is probably not confined by God. (The child molesting of course)

I am afraid I am watching a different sport than you.  The one I am watching is a team sport.  It is about the engineers and mechanics back at the shop, the crew at the track, the crew chief, the equipment, the driver.  Ironically, it is even about the staff at the shop who answer phones and sweep the offices.  It is about the team owners and their assistants who glad hand sponsors and media.  It is about the hauler driver doing his job right, and on time.  It is never EVER just about "the best car."  I often say "I want the fastest car to win."  But that is shorthand for "I want the team and equipment that pulled it together the best for this race to win."

Thanks so much for this. I'm going in for my performance review this morning and your comment has given me more confidence. You are right that work is not and should not be my entire life (even if my bosses choose to do that for themselves). It's so easy to get sucked into the culture of long hours, but as you say - if the bottom line depends on staff working tons of unpaid extra hours then maybe they need to consider resourcing, other efficiencies, what the goals actually are (all probably true in my case!).
For sure. Extremes are nearly always not the answer.   We are built for movement, not sitting still in any position for long periods of time.

The 1950s are a dream compared to this shit. There is most definitely a culture war. You're a fool to say otherwise. I'm hardly high on ideology compared to the lemmings of this so called nation. 
Um, spoiler please
The trouble with this "love comes from the inside" idea is when you *don't know* how to love yourself. People aren't complete, independent lifeforms separate from each other. We are strongly influenced by other people. But most importantly, other people are how we *learn*, not just about how to understand ourselves but how to understand how we fit in with others. So, it's not as simple as saying, "Love yourself first." People have to learn how to do that by asking others.  If getting a gym membership to be more attractive to someone who's fit is what gets you to the gym, that should be fine. If you *keep* the gym membership even though you're miserable, that's when I would say it's a problem. But you don't make the leap from feeling unattractive to feeling attractive by telling yourself you're beautiful even though you're unattractive. That's something you work on internally and externally. And that's how the "love yourself" bit works. If it was as simple as accepting yourself the way you are, no one would be complaining about getting a date because they'd *know* there's nothing they can do about it. The issue here is someone complaining because they know they can do something about it, they're only expecting that something to be you or me or someone else. And when you say, "I am attracted to what I'm attracted to," you are effectively telling that person that the change can't happen outside of themselves. The only difference in what I'm saying is that I think you go a step further by helping affirm to them that they can change and they can get closer to the things that make them happy, whatever those may be. But let's be clear here: If you want something, don't wait for it to come to you. Do whatever you can to go for it.
My sales actually increased, and I haven't been using the new offer feature. I had a REALLY slow period end of Jan-beginning/middle of Feb, but it's finally picked up the last week and a half!   I'd say it's definitely because I've been listing more. I went up from 150 listings to 200 (and more to list still) in the past week because my family did a MAJOR closet/house clean-out, so I'd say see if you can get to listing! New items should revive interest in your closet.

" İf you were in his position you would probably do the same. Why is earning money bad ? He has done so much for this country and deserves some reward. Back then it would be impossible for him to become prime minister without gülen, he knew he was dangerous and tricked him just to remove him later. Everyone in this country has done bad things, but erdoğan has at least improved the country significantly "  Then he proceeds to tell me stuff about the new roads, hospitals, investments into rural Anatolia, him being a practicing muslim, lifting the opression on hijabis and him not being an american dog.   Turkey is slowly becoming a superpower again and the west is angry because we're not puppets anymore.   My father is a weird man and loves his conspiracy theories. I feel like there is some truth in the part with not being western puppets anymore though.

&gt; Reagan legalized more than 3 million illegal immigrants, George W Bush proposed an amnesty, and Reagan wanted to create a NAFTA which would have allowed free passage of people from Mexico and Canada into the US  Sure, but Bush also curbed illegal immigration greatly by enforcing the San Diego fences more. What about Hoover and his hispanic deportations? You didn't respond to that.   &gt; Also, France before the current migrant crises had millions of North African and African migrants and millions of descdents from those immigrants.  Yes, and the right wing populists of France are growing in numbers as a result.   &gt; here were also hundreds of thousands of Turks and millions of descdents from Turkish immigrants in Germany,  Sure, but not on the scale recently. Which is why we are seeing more right wing populism in Germany.   &gt; and the UK had the same case with south asian migrants. There is an ebb in flow to things, eventually, things will calm down, and those right-wing parties will disappear.  Sure, and that is why they voted for Brexit to occur and limit immigration. I don't see how you can say right wing parties will disappear  when literally they are growing in all of these countries.

There are a few things that I don't know to add in the calculation. With the 20% **MORE** attack speed and the flat physical, I can assume it will be very substantial with just a rare tier 1 or 2 shield, Which could very easily hit (550+ pDPS). I would assume it will be better then flat phys cyclone with a rare 2h axe. So upwards of 500k for little to no cost and decent survive. Edit : Words
Trump said about Sessions " He probably saw the big crowds I had and decided to jump in like any politician." Trump isnt happy with Sessions.

He wouldn't even need to make it into a Horcrux. The Soul Stone naturally siphons off a section of your soul and locks it inside a pocket dimension called Soul World inside of the stone itself.  If we're going by HP magic rules, then he wouldn't be unable to die ever due to being part of Soul World. If we're going by Marvel rules, his physical body could be destroyed, and the rest of his soul could go to the Afterlife, but a section of his soul would forever be tethered to Soul World.

What you and I experience are very similar with hearing out of place sounds and everything else. Sometimes we could be walking through the park and suddenly hear a heavy wooden door slam shut, where there would be no door nearby and such things.   I'm diagnosed schizoaffective with OSDD-1b and we'd like to assure you that we don't think it's all delusion :)  A correct diagnosis is important fursure, but knowing how *you* feel is the most important thing. Not sure if you hear them, but I hear whispering, a thousand hushed voices and not a word I can understand. If your internal voices have names, that means you've spoken to them, right?

I've already used Hjerim on multiple playthroughs before on the vanilla 360 game, many of which were stormcloak characters. Given the backstory for my scottish two-hander I feel he would remain neutral in the civil war, and he'd probably find Windhelm to be too much of a run down icy slum to want to actually settle there.
You are allowed to see any information that a medical establishment has about you and request stuff to be removed. A doctor isn't going to write "drug user!" in black marker across your file. It's possible they will make a note if you show blatantly obvious drug seeking behaviour, try to steal their prescription pad etc and even then you can get it removed if it's not true.   Finally, you can always go to another doctor. They don't get your records automatically from every other doctor in the country (unless you have something like an online, single point medical history thing - and if you have that then it's even easier for you to see what info there is about you - there is no secret doctor-only section. These systems are super expensive and very sensitive to privacy, they exist mainly for the elderly and the chronically ill)   The exception to all this registers for specific things that track how often a person buys pseudo ephedrine for example. And for them you will be told very clearly what it is, why you need to show ID, etc.   As someone who is a past drug user who worried a lot about this stuff, let me tell you that the complete pictures of your  health is more important than any bias that a small percentage of shitty health workers might show you - and its just as likely that a shitty worker would find other ways to discriminate anyway, like race, gender, weight etc. The huge huge majority of medical workers a great human beings, there are assholes in every industry.

I too interacted him and while I told him he was being a jerk (I was too) I have to say he was no chud, I literally do not know what about his current opinions you find so problematic. Just  because he won't denounce gamergate strongly enough? Feels like a time machine here. Idk he says it was bad and that's good enough for me, even without any self-flaggelation.

I wanted to say I agree completely with your assessment. I lean left on most social issues and even a little left fiscally, but I split from most people in my circle on gun rights. I believe very strongly I should be able to own weapons that can compete, at a minimum, with what the police have. With that said, it shocked me how easy it was in my state to buy an AK47 variant, a drum magazine, and hundreds of rounds if ammo. I was in the military and grew up shooting guns. I'm very comfortable around them and have been on the receiving end several times while deployed. I don't think you should be able to walk into a store and walk out with what I bought in a matter of 15-20 minutes. I'm 100% okay with having to wait a reasonable amount of time and prove, perhaps through a class, that I can safely handle a weapon with that much power. The average person should not be able to get a rifle like that as quickly and as easily as I was able to. It won't stop people who shouldn't have them from getting them entirely, but I know enough about human behavior to know making it harder, either by waiting or through certification, will deter a lot of people on the edge, which may reduce the overall probability of mass shootings. 
It's not about best way. It's about not being able to clear my red maps in a reasonable time with a skill I like.

Just got dumped three weeks ago. Thought I was ready to start dating again (or at least find a rebound). Downloaded Tinder, used it for five hours, became depressed by the sad state of "available" men out there, deleted the app.  I'm so thankful I downloaded Tinder because it made me realize that I am absolutely in no way shape or form ready to start dating again or to put myself out there.  I've recently embarked on trying to lose weight. I'm learning to cook healthy meals for myself and I started doing yoga. I've been reading a lot more lately, watching TV shows that make me laugh and spending time with my family.  It feels freeing that for once in my 30 years of existence, I don't feel the need to have a man in my life to make me feel whole or happy.  I'll eventually start dating again but right now I'm just focusing on myself.

An account ban is quite severe, let alone a console ban. I would imagine that it would have to be extremely serious to get the former, let alone the latter. Thus, I think it would be unlikely you would get a console ban.  The only one I ever heard of getting console bans are hackers/cheaters that repeatedly open new accounts to circumvent the account suspension.

But revolutions are costly and violent, it only happens when things have got so bad. the conflict in me as a Chinese who wish for a democratic government is I hate to see dictator keep winning but I also don't wish for people's lives f*cked up to a point where revolution becomes the only viable solution.  Plus, throughout the history of this country, we had countless revolutions and rebellions, but at end of the day, people only unseat the man who sits on the throne but not the existence of the throne itself, I honestly don't think things have changed much today.

That is the sign of someone that didn't let the engine warm up a bit before running at high RPM's. I'm not sure if there's a way with the volt to warm up the ICE before use. Most ICEs have an iron block and aluminum heads, these different metals heat at different rates so on a cold morning this difference in heat/expansion rates is torture on the head gasket that seals the two parts together and the high compression area of the combustion chambers can damage the gasket.
that isn't sustainable in the long run.  Just make sure you are doing it short term basis only.  As long as there is light at the end of the tunnel you should be okay.

The first Need for Speed: Most Wanted has been replayed time and time again. I'm still questioning whether or not to call it a masterpiece.
depends how flammable they are
I never liked watching that movie because the scenes like those just made me feel anxious.
&gt;Wie fühlt es sich eigentlich an, von einer Falschnachricht in die andere zu laufen?  verlinkt Snopes... lol

I'm thinking about making a picture frame with just enough space for each catridge to go in. Each slot would work similar to how a cassette tape worked on a stereo that you would push open. 
No I'm 23 but I feel like that'd be cute, or maybe like a picture of a dog or something
This helped me a lot thanks!
Keep watching, the credits have not rolled 
The account is 8 hours old and says nothing but things this subreddit would rage over.  Honestly I'm calling troll on this one.
IGN: Jedi  Deposited: Lv.1 Bulbasaur, M, Friend Ball  Thanks a lot!
how can anyone think there is anything conspiratorial here?  Walton fucked up, price dumped because people feel deceived.
No it's a daisy 
I think a solid, non-inflatable boat should suffice.
May be repeating some here, but just want to hammer them home.  - Try to stay away from the Flyfish when it's looking for targets, swimming around underneath it can cause it to face away from the team (or towards the shore) when it's vulnerable.  - Use your specials, strategically would be best.  - Every stage has ideal "focal points" for salmonid rush levels, where all four players should ideally be stationed. For the love of Poseidon, if someone is shouting "This Way", take their advice.  - If you're the first to see which direction enemies are coming from, call players over.  - A life ring can be invisible in a battleground. If you want revived, shout for help. Don't assume I can see you because you can see me.  - If you get a Scrapper's attention, try to move so that it faces away from the rest of your team. Easy kill.  - Don't guard faraway eggs. The rest of the team will be one player down while they try to deal with the carnage elsewhere.  - And I cannot stress this enough, I beg you take this one on board. If all four players swim back to the basket and deposit eggs at the same time, you absolutely MUST "Booyah".
I have dibs on reposting for the next 6 months
I’ve been using that as well. The way mountains form, where deserts and jungles would be, and climate based on latitude. Thanks for the help.

Drove to Colorado once, it's a long way but it's a beautiful trip through a huge variety of terrain.  Favorite moment, just after leaving utah, gps pipes up "Turn right in six hundred and fifty kilometers".

Lol come se il suo voto contasse qualcosa rispetto alle decine ( centinaia?) di migliaia che può spostare...  A me sembra una scusa piuttosto debole
I would ask for compensation. Give them a figure. That’s your work, produced for them. It’s just how it works. I’m an editor in network tv and documentaries and we always pay.   Just my opinion, good luck!
Well, so have I and you don't see me that disconnected from realty. And believe me, I used to do a lot of shit.
there's no chance that team makes the playoffs 
I too love wizards, but I've never played a witch, and after reading all their abilities I think I would just piss of my GM more than anything else.
F     ( even if i never played it )
Okay but the more important question is how did you take a video of your screen??? 
Yay!!! Glad I could make you laugh.   So he’s just stupid lol. Got it. 
Isn't this combo actually Triangle &gt; Away+O &gt; Triangle+O &gt; Triangle+O ?
Yea, I know it'd be better to go with another chapter like Blood Angels to ramp up the melee ability, but the majority of my models are painted as Ultramarines and I don't fancy repainting them just to try something new. xD
My 19th Great grandmother Verona Von Urikon was the sister of three Knights Berenger, Conrad, and Rudolf who all died at the Battle of Morgarten on November 15, 1315. Verona's other brother Albrecht was a priest so Verona got all of the family estate in Uerikon, Switzerland. She married a second cousin Wizo  Wirtz my 19th Great grandfather. They had at least 5 children.  
It sucked
Do you like praying or do you like howling at the moon with a vengeful wail?  ~~righteous vengeance is fun roll for Edmond~~  Amakusa is better gameplay wise but he's kinda shit when you're just killing mooks since he'll just make the level go slower  Edmond's slightly better for that due to his AOE NP and big beatstick attack but he's pretty shitty at challenge content  Both have their uses so either one of them will do good work, but unless you really like their characters, just continue saving for a future banner

Tim Duncan slapping the floor after missing the layup in Game 7 of 2013. Also Tim getting swatted by Ibaka in his last ever game and walking out with his finger up. 
It worked for me but it took almost the full six months. I had pretty severe cystic acne and very oily skin. The sitting oil on my face is completely gone now and I rarely break out. It's been about 4 years or so since I took isotretinoin. There are a lot of side effects related to the dehydration caused by this drug. As I understand it, Isotretinoin works by promoting cell turnover and stopping oil production. I experienced: extremely dry lips, eyes, eczema on my hands, headaches, mood swings, poor night vision, and joint pain. All of my side effects went away, except I still have moderately dry skin and eyes, but I'm fine with that. You're going to need to drink a ton of water, avoid alcohol, get monthly lab tests, and get monthly pregnancy tests if you're a girl. I would recommend checking out the Accutane subreddit; which is the name brand for this drug. r/Accutane 
That's what's hanging me up with Kaito. I liked Meiko's setup well enough, and already have Rin and Len on pre-order (was going to wait on Len but I managed to get him for almost 30% off). So with the collection coming I feel like i should get him to complete the set, he is just so meh compared to the others.
I liked Sing the sorrow at the time, it felt heavier. I still have a soft spot for it, even though it didnt age well for me. I can listen to art of Drowning in a sitting and love every second. Sts...I skip unless im in the mood. Everythong after that...utter dogshit.
Haha habol ko rin yung itlog tsaka yung fried/garlic rice.
A bidet because I am civilized 
Yea..I can see the panic sell off happening too....which is insane...its gambling on our gambling. The US has taken regulatory measures this year, and kind of said its all good...they seem to have been pretty level headed about crypto in terms of evaluating it and not being quick to do things that would really harm those that want to pursue this tech within the boundaries of our existing legal framework. I am quick to hate on the govt, but with this, and all the way back to original FINCEN hearings on this stuff, they have been very reasonable.
no idea about what? your sentence structure makes zero sense
Ahhh the wake up CA after yours just connected, a classic!!

Home alone. What type of retarded irresponsible parents would ever let that circumstance even come into play?
Nice move from you! Looks like you frustrated someone tho.
Weird because I made an argument against Peterson in this very thread, but it was downvoted below threshold and ignored. Are you sure that it's not Peterson's acolytes who are actually the ones who have trouble with objectivity?  edit: thanks for proving my point lmao, enjoy your "we are very rational" circlejerk
Yea I suppose so.

Not sure why you're downvoted, he did get paid a ridiculous wage compared to players that actually...trained and played
Absolutely. But how can I continue until I can get an appointment with one? I'm mainly worried about something happening before I ever get to see someone and I'm not sure how to proceed until then.
So it's doubleplus fake news... which makes it true.   Interesting...
shorting is frowned upon here for some reason, as if selling is evil.  Do yall really think if crypto is ever going to be mass adopted as you desire, that the price fluctuations up and down at this stage will matter? lol  Don't let them mess with your head!  But also watch out shorting bitcoin I lost everything doing it once (2btc)

Just really embarrassing to watch as a Lebron fan. I honestly can't understand how he turned so passive that series, its like whole years worth of criticism hit him all at the same time and he froze 
Yes! Its so annoying that I got this screen after trying once.
Matt Forte will be missed, it's an insult that the bears kept Cutler longer then they kept him.
That’s a terribly weak argument though... I’ve gone to the shooting range and didn’t particularly find it exciting even though I respect how others can.  It doesn’t really invalidate the person you were replying to. 
Hey Nick! I loved Caged Bird, Steel Forest and my quartet did as well. Where can I find/buy the sheet music for this quartet? My collegiate studio just recently had another bari donated so we have enough to play this. I would love to give it a try.
yeah thats a good point, shoulda mentioned rarity. But rerolling into a different unit of the same rarity and color makes it so that it doesnt actually change the rates at all.

Not sure there's too much use in the Dolos on an AR9 when you could just unscrew the handguard and the barrel pops right off.  
Oh that's normal. Shug's armour lets him tank the first hit, so he isnt put into hitstun. Thus in the short time before the 2nd hit, he can move his guard and block.
how exciting!

Oh wow!!  It’s an optical illusion!  If you stare long enough you see a catapult!  
I work at subway, can confirm this shit happens more than you would think.
The company my fiancé currently works for threatened to dock pay for hours worked on a computer issue if it wasn’t “permanently fixed”.   I may or may not have made an anonymous call to the contract holder about their client employing wage theft as a means of motivation.   The next day it was decided that he would be paid, but not because Virginia has a strict hours worked=hours paid policy.   A fuck ton of companies try to save money by bullying their employees into thinking they have to pay for or get their checks docked to fix a mistake. The “it’s in the handbook” is often the go-to for these places because a lot of people don’t understand that if there’s a law regarding the situation, it supersedes any handbook.   Tl;DR adulting fucking sucks
Not a fashion tip, but you are stunning.thank you for posting
&gt;then it should be applied universally, no?  I don't personally see service in the police and the army as particularly similar, so I can't say I would necessarily agree with you. But again, this isn't my position and I haven't given it a lot of thought. 
Racism is an idea. To kill an idea is something we as humans have never seen before so there is no real way to judge how it would turn out. My view of racism is that its plain discrimination. I do not classify something like cultural appropriation as racism but instead see it as a good thing. We talk about the whole “melting pot” aspect of America as a good thing and yet see cultural appropriation as a bad thing. It’s odd to me. The mixing of cultures should be one of the goals of any leader. The more you understand a culture, the less likely you are to discriminate against them. If anyone could allow all people to gain an understanding of everyone’s cultural, it would be an amazing thing no matter how fast it happened.
I think you're wrong and you think you're right so agree to disagree, and we'll both watch YouTube moderate the comments legally.

Old baseball phrase "Batter up".   Say it. Say it again. Then again and again and again. Faster each time. Eventually you'll hit the sound you need to do (or a close enough facsimile).   Keep it up till you get a hang of what is happening in your mouth enough to replicate it. 
'Symmetrical Speeds means that your download speed will now match your upload speed.'  Does this mean your download speed matches your upload speed?. Or the other way around?. Because if your Internet 50 - and get upgraded to Internet 75 - this would mean your upload speed is 50Mbps and your download speed would match this (Making it the same as you have)?   Confusing wording.

Mm hmm. They call them "dank."
They should not look to "celebrities" in the first place, they are investing time and giving money to people who don't care about them, they could earn money or help a relative instead but no they care about "celebrities".

I'd hang with people who know how to survive an apocalypse!
I do not know what happened, but correcting something that did take place is usually a two way street. Having said that, I unfortunately do not see any diplomatic effort on your end to get accepted again. Sometimes it is better to just apologize regardless of whether you think you are right or wrong in order to get ahead. It is my assumption that you have to make a choice between ego and community.   From the little I have seen the mods have a lot of patience.....more than most people. There might be an anti-spam bot in place in the Telegram group. As stated, I do not know what happened, but you must have triggered one of the two.

"Mom, can you buy me the new _intelligence IQ test ADHD relief magic cube for autism kids and adults_?"
(That article is very long, so I don't think I have time to read it at the moment, so my apologies there!)  I guess I would say that I see it in a very similar light as I see/saw the "otherkin" trend that went around a few years ago. I see it as simply a 'fad' idea that's going on, where people who feel different in one way often link it to something because they know it exists. Like, I would say that it seems the vast majority of "nonbinary" people, or at least the openly visible ones, seem to be gay/bisexual women. It seems to me that a lot of them, at some point, figured out they were gay/bi and then heard of the nonbinary trend and  jumped onboard because of a lot of the attributes that people claimed of it were things they themselves had("I like doing girly things sometimes, and I like doing manly things sometimes" yeah, so does pretty much everyone!)  "Last Point": Sorry, what I mean by that is that people claim that they are "nonbinary" or "genderfluid" while, often, having different ideas of what it means, and having no way to prove that they actually are this thing.
Wow, that is actually kinda clever though illegal. 
Dank

I agree 100%.  I think Shinji, Martial, Pogba, Lukaku and Rashford would all work well together. But I guess it was never meant to be.  Moyes, who not only was inept for us, he also opted for Mata, who admittedly was EPL proven and probably the better player, and LVG would rather Kagawa play as a CM because Mata gets the no.10 role.  Now with Jose, who don't favour the free-flowing attacking play, Kagawa would never shine playing for us.

There wouldn't be "conspiracy theories" if they gov't just told us the truth.  We know more than they do which is why everything seems like a coverup.  
People ask me that all the time. If it's in a social situation, I'll tell them a lie, "$9/hr for the first 3 years" or something. Or of they don't know me and ask what I do, I tell them I drive an ice cream truck or I reset the pins at the bowling alley.  However, I am a lineman of sorts for Att. If a customer asks me how much I make, which they do often, I tell them the truth. Not how much I make, but how much the position starts off. "I think they're hiring off the street starting at $20-25 an hour". Only because most people are asking because they need a job or their kid or husband needs a job.

Check out cronometer! It tracks your macros and micros, so you can see if there are any nutrients you are missing out on that could be the cause.   Cronometer also shows you your total calories taken in both including and excluding fiber. Basically, when you eat a lot of whole grains like rice and quinoa and amaranth and things, you poop quite a bit of it out without digesting it, meaning you’re counting those calories in but they’re not actually fueling your body. It can give you an idea of how many calories you’re using up, and you can adjust from there.
