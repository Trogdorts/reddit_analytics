With an ageing population and negative population growth Japan is the one country that should be jumping at squiring refugees and integrating them into the workforce regardless of xenophobia. 
I wish they never went for mobile at all and kept the version PC exclusive. Imagine how much better the game would be now without everything implemented having to be implemented with mobile in mind.

Sure, there is SOME skill, but the main factor is RNG and RNG = time.  It's sad that there is even a leaderboard where you can have someone in 1st spot who gets a rift filled with zombies and clears a 73. Then you get someone who clears a 70 but with ghosts or WA. The 70 GR would be much harder to finish, but with skill would be possible. It would also require far more skill than the "Higher" 73 that had zombies.  If there is going to be different monster types, then have them across all difficulties. There shouldn't be "easy" GR. They should all be nearly impossible at the high levels and should ONLY be able to be beaten with skill, not lucky map/mob/pylon rifts.  How can you even have a leader board that is supposed to dictate "skill" when the actual difficulty is so ridiculously skewed that it's impossible to actually gauge whether or not one person is actually better than the other, or just lucky.  I think RNG is great, but it has no place anywhere near something that has a "leaderboard". Especially when completing high GR is basically 90% luck, and 10% skill.
It doesn't even matter really in the grand scheme of thing. . Even in the not so grand scheme.

A few of my recent purchases have actually had "thanks for buying" messages instead of dire warnings about piracy. Usually it reminds me to put the popcorn on, so I don't know if it can be skipped or not... but hopefully it can.

That was a really cool overhead shot of second base. We have a roof why can't we have a shot like that. I don't think it even has to be a camera man up there. We could have an automated latched to the roof so that when the roof is closed we get that cool shot.

Your welcome and I understand :). emotion sucks and even seasoned traders deal with bad days. The key is to plan ahead before you get emotional because you are in a position. The worst mistakes I ever made were based on spur of the moment emotional impulses. If you can eliminate the down side emotions have on your psychology, you will do well.
&gt;I feel bad for you  This pity is false, just like your happiness facade. Your happiness isn't real and you know it. And eventually, it'll harm you.

If they would have lost, it would have been a great chance for the DM to fuck with the party.  The paladin especially.  Have the demon spare them in exchange for them doing a favor for her.  Or for a favor down the road.  Something that would keep them in debt to, or working with, a demon.  Give the Paladin an ulcer trying to figure out if what he's doing is right or wrong.  Good stuff.

Well, you're not going to get by on $70 without doing SOME level of cooking, but I don't think you need to go quite that far into the "from scratch" method.

That was... A much more sensitive piece than I expected from Forbes.  I actually think the 'Reds' in KSR's *Mars* books had a point -- we need to think seriously about whether it is a good idea to go around disfiguring other planets. I'm sure that's an unpopular opinion, though.
 am getting a bit worried now actually since I do not have a mic. Being a new group everyone needs to be on their A-game and me not being able to communicate could mean deaths and wipes that would otherwise be avoided.

Ah, sorry. It's hard to keep all these conflicting beliefs straight :-)  But that's a significant factor as well. If the idea that "disobedience to your higher-up" or "knowing something you're not 'supposed to' know" is the REAL original sin, no wonder there are so many sheep-like people around who are afraid of knowledge and castigate people who stand up to authority figures!
Just play casually. On weekdays I play enough to burn 10 keys, 3 tickets and about 150-180 meat, more grinding on weekends. Still can make it into &lt;50% masters pretty easily which is enough for me. It helps if you play with no expectations lol.

If you're in a small group, the speed at which you can clear U1 still outweighs U6 even if it has better drops.
Man, of course I'd be super stoked if that becomes the case... but I worry that our offense will be too one-dimensional to pull away from Georgia at any point in the game, keeping Chubb an option for them the whole time. I think that if our defense neutralizes UGA's ground game (a tall order for sure) and Lambert has to make plays out of necessity rather than choice - we can win the game. Additionally, if Derrick Henry can go man-mode like he has in several big games past, easing the load on Coker and allowing us to limit turnovers/stay conservative... we'll be ok.  We'll see. I agree that our defense will step up, potentially forcing some turnovers. My optimistic prediction is Bama 31 UGA 27.
Consider the few performances that each of these actors *did* leave behind.   In *East of Eden*, James Dean helped usher Method acting into American cinema, which makes it one of the most important and influential performances of all time (in my mind, it's right up there with Brando in *On The Waterfront*). *Giant* and *Rebel Without a Cause* may not be as monumental, but they're still solid performances in highly-regarded films, and *Rebel* is absolutely iconic.  Heath Ledger gave an Oscar-worthy performance in *Brokeback Mountain*, which was largely ignored because of its subject content (does anybody actually think that *Crash* was the better film, much less the best film of 2005)? And his role as the Joker would have been absolutely worshipped regardless of whether or not he had died because it's an incredible performance. All circle-jerking aside, he disappeared into that role and gave one of the great Method performances of the 21st century.  And River Phoenix was arguably the *most* talented of these three actors. In his short career, he worked with some of the most iconic directors of the time: Rob Reiner, Peter Weir, Sidney Lumet, Steven Spielberg, Gus Van Sant, etc. *Stand By Me* and *Running On Empty* are two of the greatest teen performances ever, and *Dogfight* and *My Own Private Idaho* are great adult performances in their own right. I personally believe that River was a better actor than Joaquin, who is one of the best actors of his generation, and it's an absolute tragedy that he was never allowed to fully come-of-age as an actor.

Oh, if the Braves series could mean jack shit, that would be amazing! Could rest some starters while getting some AB's for Holliday, Adams, and Grichuk.

Yeah I know my solutions aren't perfect, but there has to be a better solution than just letting them go. Sure horses can go some places dirt bikes can't, but you just have to be able to catch them quickly as they flee. Take out a few of their horses as they leave the scene, which would be completely valid for fleeing from law enforcement, and they will think twice about doing it next time.

Honestly I don't think a 944 is any kind of "settle for" car. They are cheaper and probably get a little less respect among Porsche snobs but I can still remember the first time I drove one in the mid 80's and it was a life changing event for me.  Nothing handles like that car. It really is a dream to drive. Of course there are cars that handle better, but the 944 really has it's own feel that isn't duplicated in any car I have ever driven.

401k: matching up to 6%, begins on the January or July after your first year at the company, and **is vested after 2 years** with the company. For example if you joined tomorrow (October 2015), your matching would start January 2017. On being "vested" after two years, this means you forfeit/lose all 401k contributions if you leave before that time. Just something to keep in mind. Compared to EY and PwC, they only match 25%, so .25 cents for every dollar, but not sure on the fine print about them.   I've never gotten a technology stipend, most of my training requests have been rejected, and my understanding is cell phone plans are only managers or senior managers and above.    For eduction you can apply for an education subsidy after 2 years with the firm. Each subsidy is really based on how much they want to keep you, so there isn't a flat rate and each one is essentially a contract. For each education contract you agree to stay with the firm for a minimum of 2 years after completion of the program.   That's about all I remember. Health benefits are decent though. Either way, if I were in your position I'd likely go for the highest base pay.

What helped me is realizing that I could just let go. I had it in my head that I needed to squeeze with my thighs on the way down, and that's just not the case. One day I'd had enough and my lazy self just sat down and the trainer was like "Yes! That's a perfect squat!" and I was like... uhh ok I can totally do this all day. You do want to keep some tension if you want to be able to get back up though. Try thrusters for both leg and arm work at the same time. They're my favorite!
In smaller offices, they also usually have the power to choose the company to support them (the GM/owner does not want to hear the office manager nagging them about computer problems).  But in larger (25+, IME) companies this roles power is diminished.  
Hosmer at 35 seems high to me. He's well ahead of JD Martinez at 52 and Posey at 44. Joc Pedersen at 62 also feels very high for a guy who struggled so badly for much of the year. But I honestly have no idea what to do with him. The 25 HR is tough to ignore but so is a 29% k rate. 
*Red looks shocked.* "Ah..ok."
I had a hell of a time with them when playing with my scrubby team with just my Starter Pack players and the couple silvers I picked up in prior games.  I bought Porzingis for cheap and he made some nice impact with his PFA shooting and especially in his rebounding and blocks.  A big suggestion I have with playing Lakers, specifically, is to control your PF on defense.  Don't worry about defending Julius Randle outside of the paint.  Just stay aware of him slashing to the basket if paint is otherwise open.  That way your PF can freelance as defensive help in protecting the paint.  I wouldn't worry about them shooting threes at all.  Maybe tighten up D on Young, but otherwise just protect the paint.
The lag is returning, sorta. Seems to be mixed.

In some places, yes, you could press charges, but most people don't because.  Children should not be forced to kiss or hug grandma or grandpa.  I hated being forced into physical contact with relatives when I was little.  It was insincere and made me feel like I didn't have the right to say no.  If you don't allow your grandkid to say 'no' to grandma's kisses, if grandma decides to molest said grandkid, they will not feel you have their back. Theoretically, most grandmas are not child-rapists.  But if you are molested, it's most likely to be by a family member.  Usually with kissing grandma, having discussions and adults being willing to let children not be forced into physical contact solves this issue without police.  Many kiss-with-grandma cases would never go to trial.  But the principle is the same.  Don't touch people until you get consent.  Unless you join a conga line where it's expected the next person who joins the line will rest hands on your shoulders or waist.  "Ruining the moment" is not worse than someone getting kissed, or groped against their will.
Hey, it counts!

I see we have a man who doesn't enjoy the finer things. 
I couldn't tell you a tutorial for it but perhaps /u/danskeman knows of one.  A system image will make a complete copy of everything on the drive that you tell it to, so you could restore from that and it would be just like it was prior to a boffo.  So what I meant was that if you do revert back to 8.1 then do a system image while in there as a precautionary measure then try to upgrade to 10 again and see if it worked out any better, and in case of a catastrophe you'd have the system image if you needed to reinstall it due to not being able to revert to 8.1  Of course this assumes that reverting works out for you and 8.1 is the same as you left it prior to upgrading.  As far as I understand, when you do a system image it is of the whole shebang, so you can't just pick out pieces of it to restore, it's sort of all or nothing when you use a system image to restore.  Hang in there for danskeman he's seems quite knowledgeable about how to do all this.  Personally I tend to fly on the seat of my pants on my own computers unless they are my business computer.

I completely agree about how natural it really is. One remembers, rather than learns.

ONI has near omniscience within the human colonies. [5 Spartans managed to make it all the way to their home planets in the Outer Colonies from Reach without detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ykUStlaDu8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m56s). This was when they were 13. In conjunction with their armor, Spartans are paramount to ninja-like stealth. Add that to 26 years of constant struggle against an enemy whose weapons could instantly kill them.

Insane that it's still scoreless. We probably should've conceded two or three, and scored at least one.  We have zero midfield presence and are terrible at set pieces on both sides. None of that is new though.

I almost moved to Oakland a few years ago. The rents were extremely reasonable, and I couldn't believe some of the amenities included. Wolf Ranges, wood floors, granite countertops, heated floors, washer and dryer in unit, water and garbage included. Sounds good!   But you get there, and see the property, and it's clear that they have cropped the photos in a way that the ghetto remains unseen. Then you realize that give you all those amenities because you will be too afraid to leave your home. And the homes are often encased in bars.

That's pretty narrow minded of you to say. What if Jesus told them to do it because it was part of his plan for salvation? Or what if assassins had their families held hostage and they threatened to kill them if they didn't pee on people?   Those both seem like very valid excuses. 
Once again, that sucks, I know the feeling. I've been at a party or event and thought, "If I wasn't here right now, everyone would be doing exactly what they are doing now, and having just as much fun." It made me feel like I was just in the way and didn't belong, and it also made think that they didn't really care for me.  But looking at back at my entire relationship with those friends, there are moments where it shows they have cared about me. I mean, they wouldn't be your friends if they didn't care about you at least a little bit. Yes, sometimes they might be sucky and leave you out of things, but the truth is that part of that is on us too. We go into that corner. We withdraw.  I want to challenge you not to withdraw. The deeper you go into your shell, the harder it is to come back out. You are not in your friend's way or inconsequential to them. You are worth bring heard and appreciated. And although your friends might be crappy at times, if you looked at your friendship with them as a whole, you could probably recall times they were nice to you and inclusive toward you. 
Oh thank god, I didn't notice. Thanks for pointing that out

Someone told me the same thing, or at least a variation, about Game of Thrones.  I just can't get into it, and I was told "it takes a couple seasons."  I kinda feel like if it "takes a couple seasons" then it really isn't a great show and you just get adjusted to it not being a great show.

**Part 1**  *A camera is placed inside a dingy hotel, it seems to be day outside, and the camera reveals Stephen Romero sitting on his bed, he seems to have just woken up, despite it being 12:30 in the afternoon*  **Romero:** Ugh, fuck, i should've cut that promo on Barker earlier than i did, damnit, why did i do that at 3 in the morning?  *Romero takes a swig of Dr. Pepper to help himself stay awake*  **Romero:** Alright, it seems to be recommended to give some time out of my precious day, to talk about the rest of the scum and idiots in this tournament, and not just Barker, ugh.  *Romero clutches his head, seemingly having a headache*  **Romero:** Fuck this sucks, but anyway, i guess i might as well start, and who better to start with, than with my fellow Stephen, Stephen Alexandria, Ah, here we see a sad, sad man, who got took out by his buddy Jack Anchor, and it seems that messed him up in the head with he talks about him self, bragging about how he fucked my mom and impregnated her with me, despite only being two years older than me, saying over and over that he's the most over person on the roster, and all that bullshit, well little Stevie, if you want to see someone who's truly the most over person on the roster, someone's who's truly as great at wrestling as he says he is? Well look no further than yours truly, 'cause you sure as hell can't find either of those in yourself.  *Romero takes another swig of Dr. Pepper, before going back to his list*  **Romero:** Alright, who's next, ah! Brian Sunrays! Our first WIR champion, and a man who's done jack shit since, tell me something Ivan Stingray, what exactly makes you a threat? You lost your world title to Sonny Carson, SONNY CARSON, someone who i can beat by lightly hitting with a wooden broom, and not only that, but you lost on a goddamn backslide, who loses to A GODDAMN BACKSLIDE, i'l tell you who Nivan Ingday, losers, complete and utter losers, and then you got your legs crushed by Nolan Hawk, and then when you came back you didn't even bother going after him, because you know you had already peaked after the end of that world title tournament, and quite simply couldn't go and do what you used to do anymore, England Rinrey, i'll tell you straight, i don't take you seriously, and i'll be very happy to meet you in the second round should you somehow win, because all that means is an easy win, over a former champion who quite simply doesn't have it anymore.   *Romero takes yet another swig of Dr. Pepper, before once again, going back to his list*  **Romero:** All right, who's next, oh! Conan O'Brien, Someone who's been driven to panic and desperation by someone who for some reason gave enough shits about her to stalk her. To be quite honest, i hope you never find this person because it will be hilarious when you finally have a full-on mental breakdown, but then again, you're a women, you have mental breakdowns every other minute, and also, i'm never going to believe you own half of Africa, that's just plain absurd and the day you do is the day we switch bodies and i end up as a tiny irish women, well that did happen once before, but i'd prefer not to talk about that.  *Romero pauses, and his eyes breifly widen as if he's having flashbacks, before taking a swig of Dr. Pepper, and continuing on.*  **Romero:** Alright who's next, John Hall? Who the fuck is this guy? *gets on his laptop and looks him up* Oh, he's a generic hardcore wrestler, heh, i bet he's also a bland, technical/high-flying wrestler like everyone else around here, mate, i don't know much about you, but i do know that you better stay out of my way.  *Romero goes to take a swig of Dr. Pepper, but realizes it's empty, and angrily throws it out the window, hitting an old lady in the head with it*  **Romero:** Oh shit! I should've recycled that! but anyway, who's next, ahhhh, Labrador Cyregjrsdfgdfbhdrfshdtgfx, Uh, fucking preachers, hate them, they sit you down, and bore you by talking about nothing for like 15 hours or so, and then they fuck off to one of their 10 different affairs with underaged women after preaching about morality for 10 days straight, fuckin' hypocrites, at least he hit Lucian with his bible while Lucian was trying to pull me off of Barker, so i hate him *slightly* less than the other people in this tournament.  *Outside of Romero's window, paramedics arrive for the old lady he knocked out*  **Romero:** Oh No! I forgot to get my other Dr. Peppers out my Car, Hold on!  *Romero rushes out to his car, and comes back with a 12 pack of Dr. Pepper*  **Romero:** Anyway, who's next here, hmm, Santino Margenex, You know Santino, i really fucking hate you, almost as much as Barker, you go around saying god this and god that, when you haven't won a single god damn match, and then you had to bring in two random cronies to increase your chances of winning a match from .000000000000000000000000000000000000001% to .000000000000000000001%, and not to mention you thinking you're all hard and shit, when you grew up upper-class, mate if you grow up upper-class, don't fuck it up by getting arrested, and if you do, don't claim you know the lives of people like me just because you served one damn sentence, i can't even fucking remember how many times i've gotten arrested ,or how many times i got away with shit, so sit down and shut the fuck up.  *Romero cracks open another Dr. Pepper, and takes another swig before going back to his list*  **Romero:** Alright, what other jabroni's do we have left, ahhh, Bobert Peacelord, yet another case of a washed-up champion, you whine endlessly about getting screwed by the powers that be, but let me tell you something, there are no powers, you're just too stupid to not get hit in the head with a chair, you should've learned long, long ago, how to avoid getting screwed, but no, you keep falling for it, and then blaming other people, has it ever crossed your mind Bobert that you just suck? Think about it for a moment.  *Romero proceeds to down his 2nd Dr. Pepper in one go before expertly throwing it in the recycle several flights down*  **Romero:** Alright, let's see here, oh! Blandy Reese's Pieces! First of all, i just gave you a wonderful endorsment deal, don't pass it up, but back to ranting on how you suck and how i'm better than you, Blandy, what exactly have you done since coming to WIR?please, tell me, because i can't remember a god damn thing, and that's all i need to tell you, having nothing to say about someone is much worse than having a lot to say about someone.  *A loud knock is heard on Romero's door, and Romero goes to open it, and then closes it instantly, and heads back to his bed seemingly shocked by what he saw*  **Romero:** Ugh, fuckin' nudists, anyway speaking of dicks, let's talk about Tunny LaLarson, the third case of a washed up champion, Tunny, have you ever won without someone holding your hand? Or without bullshit by yourself? Because i don't think you have in a year, Mate, i'd beat you in half a second with no one to guide you through how to run the ropes, or how to perform a bodyslam, or giving you a cane, You're a bad wrestler, and you might as well retire because you're never seeing that world title ever again.

Capra hits reasonably hard for how early he is, and the tight quarters make the camera an enemy too.   Dogs are what eff this fight the most though. They can stun lock you easily.   Go in, Dodge Capras first attack then find a dog and kill it. Rinse repeat. Just stay out of corners or the pillars.   Once the dogs are done Capra is pretty straightforward. Attacks are medium slow speed and can be blocked unless he goes two handed.

My mother and I suspect that my Great Aunt kept my Great Grandmother alive for money. My GG was sick for years and needed help eating, bathing, walking etc. She couldn't talk or use the bathroom by herself or anything. My Grandma and my Great Aunt took care of her and got paid by the state for not putting her in a nursing home. My GA was in a lot of debt from credit cards and such and got caught multiple times stealing money from family members. My GG was on her death bed 3 separate times, a priest came to read her her last rights and everything, and she made a miraculous recovery every time. It turns out she stopped eating so my GA was crushing up her meds and putting them in her water to keep her alive, doing everything she could to extend her life and not let her pass even though it was way overdue. My Grandma didn't want any part of it and didn't like to talk about it and she kind of ignored our questions about it. We could tell something was up but my Grandma isn't the type of person who would speak up if something like this were happening. My GG finally passed away about a month ago and we were all relieved because she had no quality of life for years, my GA didn't even go to the funeral.
It's an older reference sir, but it checks out.

Remove 2 mod slots (or more), remove serration/multishot, and let people choose what elemental combination they want. I'd even be more drastic, removing +% damage altogether, and turning elements more towards their procs (increase the number of effects they have, and give them some stat that increases the chance/strength of those different effects).  The multiplicative damage calculations WF has now are just completely bonkers:  * Serration: 1.65 multiplicative * Multishot: .9 multiplicative * Elements: .9 additive  With 3 elements, you get a multiplier of 18.6 (2.65 \* 1.9 \* (1 + .9\*3)) of base damage. With 4 elements, you have a 23.2 multiplier. It's absurd.
This has to be a troll post...

Uhhh since Tobin served 6 months of his sentence in jail, it in no way contradicts what the guy to whom you are responding said, which is that diversion (a non-jail sentence like community service) isn't offered for these kinds of offences.

You missed the addition of two new characters, so it seems
Gotta completely disagree on this. In Dota if your hero lacks mobility you can buy it, while Flash in LoL having a 5 minute cooldown with a fraction of Blink Dagger's range doesn't exactly shore up a hero's lack of mobility. The fact that Sven and Ursa buy Blink Dagger isn't a problem with the heroes, and the heroes aren't completely useless.  The absence of turn rates in LoL allows ranged carries to orbwalk BACKWARDS, retreating while shooting the targets that are chasing at the same time, and combined with how much damage AD carries actually deal when they get their shots off in LoL, melee carries without gapclosers are really fucking useless because they can never catch their targets and they just die.  Now imagine if turn rates didn't exist in Dota. The effect wouldn't be as great in LoL because Blink Dagger exists, but saying turn rates contribute "very little" to balance is just downright wrong. Carries with long range like Drow Ranger would be somewhat ridiculous and even non-hard carry heroes with long range like QoP would be ridiculously strong if they could kite you while getting free rightclicks on you the whole time (and in QoP's case she can Blink backwards and repeat if you keep chasing). Ranged supports as a whole would be significantly stronger if they could deal rightclick damage while retreating (e.g. AA, Dazzle, etc)
But do they know math, science, history, formal grammar, etc?  Sure you can read a lot of literature, but that won't necessarily help on the tests. 
Added Thomas Rawls. Bought Lynch + Boldin for John Brown, CJ Anderson, Ronnie Hillman, and Lance Dunbar.  I'm happy.   EDIT: For clarity, I'm not naive. I know this was an egregious case of someone panicking. But I think it's a good point to add to the spectrum. Take a peek at the other deals people are able to land, and apply it to your own league and experiences.
The reason is that... it can be used for suicides so easily.  It's the same reason we don't have coal gas ovens anymore.

I'd prefer they build for/license the technology to local governments - transportation should always be a public service and human right. Especially since single occupancy vehicles are only most efficient for some specific parts of commutes, and the backbone should be built on rail that can transport hundreds of thousands of people an hour. It'd be great to have an integrated system that allows you to put in a destination into your smart device, automatically call up a self driving car that will transfer you to high occupancy transit, and have another car waiting for you to take you the last mile, the same way many people currently use cab hailing apps. I currently integrate a highway bus with downtown cycling, and my commute is significantly faster than driving would be.
Well, to be honest, I'm all about voting with your wallet as that is one of the key factors that makes capitalism so successful.  However, there is a stark difference between not buying a product to show your disapproval and stealing it.  Both send messages.  Edit: Spelling

I wasn't a ranker last season.  And 170 isn't bad. With 28 teams that means that person thought you were a 7th round pick.
Science just tells us about the world. Disciplines like philosophy can help us make sense of that information. I never said that I believed in god. I actually believe in god much less since writing that comment. I realize now that there are inductive and deductive methods for (maybe) getting close to an answer. But it's obviously hard to really know for sure.

I'd say making the same stuff lends itself to certain bands. When Judas Priest made albums like Nostradamus, which was quite experimental and different, it was met with a lot of criticism. But when Redeemer of Souls came out, which was a lot like their old stuff, people loved it. Could also be that the new guitarist that replaced K.K. gave them a second wind.   Though Muse is not one of those bands. They need to experiment. The prog rock formula that was Origin of Symmetry and Absolution gets stale fast.

why is this so hard
I'm excited to see what Porzingis potential could be in the nba so the Knicks, I then want to see what happens with the Sacramento Kings with the roster they have. Timberwolves could be a must watch with the exciting starting lineup they have this season. And last I would say heat but as I am a Heat fan it does not count.
Amazing story,do you have any regrets from your trip ?
Sweet, thanks for the info.
Pretty sure you guys have nearly got that on lock baring some sort of disaster.

&gt;This is not actually the biggest forging I've seen. Last year I worked on a 48" diameter   Nuclear reactors tend to be 4-5m diameter, so this is a bit bigger.
I think devourer is better for irelia, but honestly, if I want a jungler like irelia, I'd just pick Jax instead. He's better in the early levels, is good with just the jungle item, and doesn't fall off as much later.   I enjoy playing Irelia jungle, but it just takes so long to become effective. Devourer scales great though. You'll be a wrecking ball with it and one other damage item (trinity or botrk).   I don't think I would get warrior on her though. It's just too mediocre to invest in. I'd rather go ranger's trailblazer straight into trinity if I wasn't going to get devourer. Warrior might be better for early ganks, but it's just a money hole. Devourer pays dividends later on, so I still think it's a decent pickup.

If you want to play Crushing Hammer instead of Enhanced Hammer, you should just play the Crushing Hammer in the first place.  It puts your opponent in an awkward position to even ask for a take back. There's a lot of people in the TCG community with a lot of social and self confidence issues that are just waiting to be walked over. I know a lot of people in this game that would let an opponent take back a move because they have confidence issues with confrontation or uncomfortable situations, even when they wouldn't want to let a move be taken back by their opponent. I don't think it's good to be that guy that is making other person's tournament experiences worse.  If you make a mistake, make a mental note to not make that the next time, accept it, and move on. If you take responsibility of the mistakes you make, then you will be less likely to make them in the future. The people that continuously make mistakes and ask for take backs tend to not learn or correct their mistakes and just get salty when someone later doesn't let them take that back and because of getting salty they don't learn and make corrections based on that mistake.  From the other side, of the person allowing take backs, it's important to remember just because you let someone take something back, they aren't obligated to let you take back a mistake later. There are many people in this game that ask people for take backs to gain an edge and cover for their sloppy play while at the same time denying their opponent to take back stuff.
To put it simply, Messi has been so good for the first half of the calendar year that he basically has it locked up. He played brilliantly and won an incredible amount with Barcelona. Ronaldo's the only other player who was still close enough to be within any shot, and was miles ahead of any other player, and it still wasn't much. Lewandowski's been incredible lately but this run is still just a tiny contribution, he was always too far behind Messi and Ronaldo.

Earth has a "wobble" which I'm pretty sure you could describe as another axes of rotation going at a different rotational velocity. Earth's tilt doesn't really have an effect on where you would end up after a complete rotation. The tilt only matters relative to the sun, so it may have an effect on the day/night cycles making 24 hrs not be a full rotation, but I think people have been assuming "full rotation" for this (also the sun is definitely being ignored for pretty much all of this).

And what I am saying is that if those businesses were allowed to discriminate but had to openly declare that they were, I would *like to think* that we, as a society, would deny them our business and send them under - would you hire a company that you knew denied same sex couples service?

But seriously man, it is a minority. And ironically, half the trolls also piss everyone off in the blue jays sub. We all hate them.
I would only get a self driving car if I could ensure its computer were 100% isolated from outside sources. Car hacking will definitely be an easy way to kill someone with self driving cars connected to the internet.

Where is the swinging lamp?
Because, feminists don't like the idea of equality for everyone, regardless of race, gender, religion ...   It's all about vegan, lesbian women who want castrate all me. It's just another one of those mass psychogenic illnesses. It has nothing to do with equality for women. That is just a smoke screen. 
why were they allowed to go that long. that era must have went thru the roof
So, she took 20% range at level 4 and again at level 20, and on Eternity, you have to defend against the Immortal. It's pretty steamroll at that point. There is no chance to get past that kind of assault and frontline to get close to her.

Can confirm this. Same birthday as you, turning 23 this year. I stopped celebrating when I turned 12 when I realized Christmas just caused a mess. Parents tried to throw me an a party for my 18th and everyone just ended up stressed and it was a generally bad time and I had anxiety attacks all night. 21st birthday was me studying for exams and playing games by myself.  Positive note is that (pending passing my last two classes) I graduate college the day after my birthday, so hopefully people focus on that instead.

i keep about 4.5 months worth of income in my bank account. so i pay every bill as soon as i know i will need to pay it.  today i went to the dentist,  have a few fillings, and paid the 700 dollar bill in cash.  on the spot to get a tiny 5% discount. it is nice now i do not need to worry about waiting for anything to come in the mail.   so i would suggest slashing your spending for a few months only by things you need to stay alive,  once you have paid all your credit accoutns and have 4.5 months of income saved then start introducing some luxaries to your life.  and pay bills as soon as possible. even pre-pay if you can!

Sanders’ popularity is an object of circlejerking on reddit.   Trump’s stupidity is not an object of circlejerking on reddit.   Trump is a psychopath with a certain rakish charm. He will, obviously, never be the POTUS.  Sanders is an earnest outsider with a certain quixotic charm. He will, obviously, never be the POTUS.  On reddit, Sanders might be the beneficiary of the same type of clueless youthful exuberance as Ron Paul once was, but they are nothing alike. (Full disclosure: I am a Norwegian who tends to vote center-right, which, by American standards makes me an extreme leftist pinko commie bastard.) Ron Paul is a batshit libertarian, whilst Sanders is a moderate social democrat. As a Norwegian, I have been under the yoke of social democracy for most of my life, and, while it is sometimes irksome in its prescriptiveness towards social affairs, it is mostly quite agreeable.
It was a tedious process for us, and this is just the way we did it.   You would start with "take it", he takes it, say "hold it", put your hand right out and let him drop it into your hand.   Then it's a matter of slowly -- really slowly -- delaying when you put your hand out. Like start with increments of 0.5 seconds. He takes it, you say hold it, wait half a second and then put your hand out. Do that a few times and then try 1 second.   You gotta work in real small increments so that you set him up for success. If you start with waiting like 5 seconds, he won't pick it up.  Once you've got him up to a few seconds, you can teach "give it" by saying the command after the can hits your hand (if you aren't already doing that).   You may not need to wait till he has a small hold; it just might be confusing to rapid fire three commands at once at that stage.

Hmm I was thinking more along the line of dota1 in wc3. I was guessing if dota1 was very vulnerable to bugs after a few changes, then most probably the engine was really terribly designed. Which was not the case with dota1. Most "bugs" back then was mostly engine limitations.

&gt; The last federal Liberal government implemented cuts the CPC could only dream of being able to get away with.  &gt; The last Liberal government was less than ten years ago.  These figures are as of 2014, and are in 2014 dollars.  Under Paul Martin as PM, total program spending increased $231 dollars per capita, compared to Harper's $66 per capita.  He increased transfer payments by $177 per capita, compared to Harper's $32 per capita.  As for increases in direct spending, Martin was $54 per capita compared to Harper at $34 per capita.

When you are aware of the problems that exist in your own life or in the nation, you have a chance to do something about it.  Maybe we can't fix our political system all at once, maybe we can't even fix our own problems all at once, but we can work on solutions and take baby steps toward improving ourselves.  People that lack that awareness can't do anything.  They have no control.  They are powerless.

Im going through it right now, (Chapyer 4 atm), I've a beast of a computer so it runs well, and is absolutely gorgeous upscaled to 1080p.  The only glitch I can think of is some very minor graphical glitching with text; some text looks like it almost has extra characters on the edges, though it's still perfectly readable.  There's also very minor glitching with speech bubbles, but luckily those aren't very commonly used in the game.  The emu community prolly has found fixes for both of those, but they havent bugged me enough yet to bother looking for a solution.

&gt; Question 1 – Is the above actually true for all (or nearly all) of Blue Pill advocates? Or do some Blue Pill people believe that The Red Pill is inherently wrong, abusive, immoral, etc., by its very nature, and that even if both parties consent to the relationship, it is not an appropriate relationship to have under any circumstance?   sure, if both consent, i guess that's fine (within reason, of course). i don't think of traditional relationships and TRP relationships as the same thing, but if someone willingly participates in either... well, good for them i guess. i'll still have my opinion of those relationships, but i don't believe that the participants shouldn't be able to make their own decisions when fully informed.   &gt; Question 2 – Does a clear power disparity, if present, change whether a Red Pill relationship is appropriate? Does it shed doubt on a woman’s genuine consent to the style/boundaries of the relationship?   same as above; if she's fully aware of the man's mindset and how he plans to treat her and stays in the relationship, i have no reason to doubt her decision. it seems to me that TRP is meant to be surreptitious and undetected, though, so i'm not sure this is really a fair question.   &gt; Question 3 – Does the man’s choice to unilaterally make changes based on his own wants/happiness affect the answers to questions 1 and 2 above? Has he pulled an unfair bait-and-switch? If a woman chooses to remain in the relationship anyway, would her actual consent to the new style/boundaries of the relationship the man is pursuing be in doubt?   if you change without telling your partner, especially if you change drastically, that's pretty unfair (something i'm sure TRPers would agree with, were the roles reversed). i don't know that i'd doubt her consent, in this case, but i would be curious about her motivations for continuing to remain in such a situation. it gets abusive, fast, and it's not uncommon for someone to stay with an abusive partner in the hopes that they will change or improve.   &gt; Question 4 – Does a man’s secrecy about The Red Pill affect the answers to any of questions 1 through 3 above? More specifically, if the woman in question knew about The Red Pill, and she would never have gotten involved with the man if she knew, but she otherwise genuinely loves the man, how he looks, how he acts -- everything else about him -- is her consent to the relationship invalid due to the man's enormous secret?   really, i think only she can decide to stay or leave (consent or withdraw). i don't think anyone can make or consider that consent invalid except the consenting individual. i'd think along the same lines of my answer to #3 though.

Yeah, I've learned not to team up with anyone that I don't know out of my circle of online &amp; real-life friends. I'll help people if they need help, but I'll always have my gun lowered, keep constantly moving, and be wary of the other player's replies.   Sorry to hear about your bad experience. I had one similar on one of the DG servers. My buddy and I befriended this group, but they assassinated us with shots to the head from behind. Fucking cowards. 
I'm guessing you've not seen the movie Hysteria?
We're here for you!  Sorry this is long, hope it helps though!  My boyfriend left almost a month ago to pursue his dream, committing to the Peace Corps for a two year stint in Cameroon, Africa. So believe me, I understand what you're going through!  First and foremost embrace, embrace, embrace that end date and your future plans. That will keep you going when you lose hope.   Somehow communication works out even like it feels it won't. Going from texting and talking on the phone nonstop to not being able to talk for three or so days between traveling and him setting up his phone was a harsh switch. Now we're able to talk on the phone about 30 minutes every day. I still miss like crazy not being able to text him every minute but those phone calls are so wonderful and actually do become enough. I'm not sure what your time zone difference will be but I'm at 6 hours and that makes communication the most difficult. I send emails or messages that I know he won't see for a while if I have something I need to share immediately or just want to share more details of things we didn't have time to discuss on the phone.  My piece of advice is to set, remember, and meet your own goals. It's easy to feel when our boyfriends are going on their huge adventures that we are kind of inadequate/aren't living up to our full potential. I'm still working on this but try to remember why that wasn't your own dream and what we want to work on when they're gone and even when they come back.   Finally, don't feel guilty about being sad or if you feel any resentment. That's normal. Enjoy the moments you share now but sometimes crying really helps and let's you get to enjoy the moment more than trying to bottle up your emotions. Same with when he leaves, give yourself some time to wallow. It is going to be a very tough day. But then again, we're here for you. On that day my bf left one of the best pieces of advice to get through that pain was from someone on here. The person told me that my bf was incredible and selfless for doing what he's doing and he obviously wants me here when he gets back or he would have broken up with me which probably would have been easiest on him too. Your timeline is much shorter (feel lucky about that too!!!) but I want you to know the same, your bf is amazing for doing this!! How many people want to study in Antarctica?! He's doing this for himself but he wants you there through it and to be there when he comes back.  It will get easier!!  
It's like he doesn't even know his name!

Classically when people think of art they think of 2D art which is, in modern times, part of our culture, it's part of a business, and it's art. Same for music, theater, cinema, etc. (doesn't mean there isn't bad art). So in a general sense movies are artwork. People that can't afford them can't afford part of our culture. Is that wrong? I don't know. I do believe it's wrong for music.

So you hate school so much that you capitalized it, why would you subject yourself to 4 years of something that you HATE?  $23 a hour depending on where you live is alright or maybe even pretty good.  School is not for every one so don't feel like you have to get a college degree.  You can still get a skill that employers want and are willing to pay for without a degree.  The trick is to get a skill and yes, that will probably require some training and that could be school, could not be.  Will this government job provide you with a training for a skill? You mentioned in other posts that you'd get a degree in accounting or finance, why those subjects?  Does number crunching and word problems interest you?  To be honest, I don't often hear people who say they HATE school become accountants.  Accountants/finance people require number crunching that often (but not always) overlaps with doing well in school or at least tolerating it.  Not saying there aren't exceptions but just not very many.

&gt;some even have ordinances which demand that the gender segregation be enforced  Understandably so. Women by and large aren't comfortable sharing public restrooms with men claiming to be women, and little boys claiming to be little girls. The idea gives a lot of people the creeps, and it's really funny whenever people pretend like it's no big deal.

Yes, the microphone was a huge selling point for me.  It does nothing for iOS users.  I get it, Apple has limitations.   Buy why no functionality with my watch like reminders?!  Quick launching apps or watch faces by name?
Absolutely, this is a real pain with a 6/6s, it seems to not work 20% of the time now vs 0% with a 5s in my experience. I'm starting to get pain in my thumb from trying to reach all the way over to swipe back in alien blue (first world problems). I imagine it's probably a default Apple behaviour though so I don't know if it would be possible to change.

i think instead of focusing on who should or shouldn't be at the game... the REAL issue is what you should or shouldn't do and we can all agree 100% that you SHOULD NOT throw flares. Period. Fans' who throw flares are FAR worse human beings than a parent who makes the poor choice of bringing a child to an event. In the end that parent is only hurting their experience. The fan who threw a flare is endangering others for no reason.

I mean in [gold her winrate is 51%](http://www.lolking.net/champions/riven?region=all&amp;map=sr&amp;queue=1x1&amp;league=gold#statistics), In [Diamond is where it jumps to 52%](http://www.lolking.net/champions/riven?region=all&amp;map=sr&amp;queue=1x1&amp;league=diamond#statistics).  Her winrate gets really fucky in Master, but It doesnt show the amount of games played just the %, since master is such a small community I'm inclined to believe its because the really good riven mains in master have on/off days.

It's definitely possible, but I don't see the same gulf in talent between the Sixers and the other lower-tier teams now that was there a year ago. And Philly has more continuity than half of those teams, which is weird for a group whose average age is like 22.5.

STOP BEING "FRIENDS" WITH GIRLS YOU'RE TRYING TO DATE FOR FUCKS SAKE.   Your are most definitely a "niceguy." That you don't fit the appearance of one doesn't change it. Being "friends" with girls that you really want to date is the "niceguy" litmus test.   So first things first - cease contact with your girl "friends." Then go find a therapist. Get into the gym and start working on the depression. Then find a new gal and ask her out. If she turns you down, politely thank her for her time AND CEASE COMMUNICATION.   You don't have to keep communicating with people you're interested in if they turn you down. It doesn't make you a bad person if you say "no thanks" when they tell you they'd rather just be friends.   &gt; Also, holy crap, I almost reached the text limit.  Not even close. We see longer posts in here on a daily basis.

Something else you've probably noticed about silver, you wont be seeing anyone in silver with the honorable player icon.
I know the feeling and when I read it I had the same response. But I know that fighting fire with fire most of the time wont get your message through and I had to pull back. Your style basically read like: the way you're feeling is wrong and its stupid and dont feel how you're feeling because x, y, z. When it gets to that point I feel it doesn't even matter if you're right, going at him like that is more likely going to cause him to push back or retreat into his negative feelings and that's not what we want to do since it wont help him.
I enjoyed this series a lot. It won't make you a fan of the Foo Fighters but it's worth it just to see all the interviews and locales. I'm not really into that style of music but Grohl seems like a nice dude with a sense of humor.  On a Foo Fighters related side note, guitarist Chris Shiflett has a podcast called "Walking the Floor." He mainly interviews musicians (mostly country/folk related), and there's a lot of good insight on music industry and history in those interviews. Quite a few of his guests are prominent guitarists (ie. Redd Volkaert, Brad Paisley, among others) and he'll usually get them talk to about playing styles, gear, influences, etc. Worth a listen if you liked Sonic Highways.  http://walkingthefloor.com/

I don't know why you're getting downvoted; this is at least partially true. My workplace uses a hybrid system of talk time + number of dials, although its fuzzy because as long as I meet set and sale goals it isn't strictly enforced.  For the uninformed, a set is when I schedule a time to show the product to a customer. I work with a complex product so the actual detailed introduction to the product takes a good half hour to an hour depending on how many questions the prospect has.

He's a good comedic heel, and I love him. I miss the heels that made you hate them, though.   There's a reason Ole Anderson was stabbed seven times. The fans hated him. There's a reason the fans rioted in the Omni thirty years ago this week. They hated Flair and the Andersons for breaking Dusty's leg.  I know kayfabe is dead, and that my preferences lean more towards the southern booking philosophy. But there has to be a happy medium between what the business has progressed to and what it used to be. Bring back some of the realism. Push the hatred.
Firstly, thank you for the response and I told her about it and she's been trying it but the website keeps asking the same questions over again.  Did you experience this as well or have another suggestion? Much appreciated!  Edit: nevermind, it worked. Sorry and thank you!
Click the 3 people connected by lines on the right-hand side (the same button to get to crew missions). Then, click the other button with 3 people on it, at the bottom of the page.  That brings up the friends list, tap her name into the bar at the top, hit search, then add her from that.

Exactly! How is it that the rational ones on here are being downvoted? Not to mention in my state(Illinois) the penal code states that vandalism is a class A misdemeanor that's a step below a felony. Class A is equivalent to drunk driving and domestic abuse, hell it can even be a felony depending on how severe the vandalism is.

Thanks for having a listen. I definitely get what you mean it's definitely much too slow and melancholy to be a typical surf style song. Just wasn't sure exactly what genre it really falls into.

Seriously - I was almost disappointed when the monsters in that movie showed up, because they really took the focus away from the real-life scariness of the cave (although there is a theory going around that the monsters in the movie were never real and the main character just went insane from the claustrophobia and imagined them, which I think is pretty cool/more realistic). And that movie was just about regular caving - I think if they made a movie about cave diving, I'd be scared to even watch it.   And haha, totally, re: the catacombs - I saw that horror movie about them last year and it was like Disneyland compared to "The Descent". Being trapped in the belly of a rock formation that has no natural light and from which there may be no way out is pretty much the most disturbing thing in the world.

If I remember correctly you won't have the tank pet yet at that point. Just keep trying it (make sure your gear is updated which helps a lot). Get your pet to attack first and then just kill them one by one. Get your dots up and cast ruin with the occasional energy drain. The protect X or Y is probably just an NPC, so if they start getting low you can cast Physick on them to heal them.
Well yeah you got to see it on a gigantic ass movie screen though!

That's a good question, I think she needed to be in the Avatar State to channel Aang's knowledge to give everyone their bending back.   However I think that the Lion Turtle in Atla gave Aang energybending and so the Avatar will have that ability from now on. Korra is the start of the new 5 element cycle that was thrust upon Aang.  So I think that Korra can energybend, but I'm not sure if she knows how to use it. I imagine she probably retains some experience from the time she used it in the Avatar State since she presumably performed it a number of times in a row, but she was in the Avatar State and I don't know if they (Avatars) can learn techniques passively while channeling them (past lives) like that.

Nah man, I'm just attracted to whoever I find attractive. Gender identity/birth sex doesn't really affect much of anything to me.  It's like to the point where I personally never understood like the huge freakout my straight classmates would have back in grade school about the existence of trans people. Like there was (and still is) this prevalent idea that trans people - specifically trans women - exist just to ensnare straight men into "gay" situations. It's so infuriatingly stupid.  So like, when I talk to people who are like "so you're bisexual, so you'd like fuck a girl with a dick?" as if it's a shocking thing, it's just a whole pile of nonsense to me. But yet they don't seem to find it believable when I say it wouldn't matter?  Gender literally doesn't matter to me when it comes to who I find attractive.

Absolutely nothing in the game needs full Vitality right side. While leveling you will probably want to balance both. You should practice using your cooldowns, so you can learn where they are needed and where they are not. Why you will probably want to have a bit of both on the right side is because in addition to being new to the game, you won't get your tank stance until you are level 40 (because you're a Paladin). This means you will be taking more damage, and have a harder time holding aggro. Vitality will help you survive while you learn when to use cooldowns, and Strength will help you hold aggro. Make sure you keep your weapon up to date as well. As you progress towards endgame, you can drop more of the right side Vitality accessories in favor of Strength accessories. When you'll do this depends on how comfortable you are with the fights you are running, and your class in general.  When you have a choice on the secondary stats, never choose the one with Parry. Skills that increase Parry chance are solid (Dark Dance, Raw Intuition) but the amount granted from your gear is so little that it's not worth it at all. Accuracy is useless until current endgame content, but once you reach that point, you HAVE to meet the cap. Skill Speed is similar to Accuracy in that you will want to meet a cap (The current opener favored by a lot of endgame Warriors requires a certain amount), but it is a lot less useful beyond that point. Also, iLevel trumps all; weapon damage and primary stats (STR, DEX, INT) are weighted so much higher than secondaries that you will always want the new piece of gear. Beyond those details, Crit&gt;Det&gt;SS.

If you are the type of person that can handle skipping breakfast, I highly recommend trying out intermittent fasting.  I was also running into the problem of eating too many calories, feeling tempted and feeling like I wasn't getting enough food to satisfy me.  This corresponded to the time when I was coming close to my goal, close to my high school weight, the body just wanted more.  Cutting out breakfast and eating between 12-8pm allowed me to focus my meals to be bigger and more satisfying.  Suddenly it became easy to stay inside my deficit and I was too full of good food to be tempted by the carby stuff.  Good luck, I wish you well.

Honestly my comment was meant half-jokingly, but as I was reading your reply I just thought that perhaps a less spammy, yet still useful implementation would be a bot that isn't "automatic" necessarily, but summoned by its username. For example, if someone uses NET in the title of the post, someone could comment:    /u/acronymbot NET   And the bot would come along and reply:    NET = "No earlier than"    Perhaps something to consider....

I'd say more-so he's evolved his signature over time for efficiency. 
Technically any unwanted physical contact that could be considered sexual. Could in theory be sexual assault. However a kiss would likely be sexual harassment after the first kiss. If they said "no" and you forced it... Then its assault.  The definitions of sexual assault and harassment aren't very clear in law. It's usually best to air on the side of "yes, I will go to jail for this if they say not to do it to them and I do anyways."
Lucky!  Smaller clubs' supporters fear the relegation reaper. All success is fleeting, unsustainable.  Larger clubs' supporters feel nothing except unmet expectations. All success is never enough.  We get to be excited by success, crushed by failure, equal parts ecstasy and agony.  In other words, we are the supporters who truly live.
Okay then. That's a relief.

Great post. I feel the same way that you do about singlehood. I really liked that you quoted the line about being single is better than a bad relationship. That is something I strongly stand by. In the past, I was in a not-so-great relationship, and ending that relationship and deciding to be single was the best idea I could ever have. Now I am happily committed to a great guy, and I can honestly say that if it wasn't for taking the time to be single and re-evaluate my love life, that wouldn't be the case. Thanks for sharing your awesome opinions!

Tagged you as "Clinton supporter". Then I'll know for next time.  Done with the snark.   I'm trying to figure out how to officially hold them accountable, not just with public outrage. Is there a legal avenue? Precedent? 
i know but i thought i read ppl saying they cant find manual controls after the update to 2.1. maybe i misread.

Congratulations, I love it. You can count me as a backer! Hope you reach your goal.
If its literally only a few drops and it stops within a few minutes I wouldn't be terribly concerned. Minor anal tears happen occasionally - even from the intended use for your anus and should heal fairly quickly.   If it doesn't heal within a few hours and you have continued discomfort for more than a day or so it may be worth getting to a doctor.   Also, you really need to get the proper equipment -  something made from body safe materials (silicone, stainless, etc) with a flared base  is a must if you are interested in anal stimulation. 
Do you recommend going to the center in the area that you want to find work or does it not matter? I'm currently residing in Glendale but the type of companies I would like to work for are more situated in Scottsdale and downtown Phoenix.

We already have fully autonomous cars. I could make one right now with someone else's car, the keys, and something heavy enough to hold down the accelerator. The big question is whether we'll have useful autonomous cars, which seems quite a ways off given how dumb consumer-access AI is now (we've all played video games) and how confusing street parking is in every city I've been to.
How did you not have a celestial weapon with 200 in the game? I had around that much and I have an epic T4 katana, AND sold a divine T1. Crafted/regarded both.
I love me some souls. I got me DeS, DS, DSII, and Bloodborne. I've beaten them all except for DeS though. Dark Souls was my first Souls game though, and I must have put a good 200 hours at the least in on it. I've beaten the game at least 5 times. I fucking love it.   Thankfully Dark Souls III looks more like 1/BB/DeS then 2, and hopefully it's good. 
Yeah, GS was Oakland's team until the yuppie scum in SF decided it wasn't, halfway through last season. Hopefully Raiders fans make the bandwagoners keep their distance.

I looked at yours and OP's post history to determine a location.  You looked at mine for personal information to attack me with to make yourself feel like a man.  How's that working out for ya, buddy?   I would sincerely encourage you to read back through your comments to me, because you are clearly projecting your own qualities on to me.  I'm sorry for your self loathing, no one should feel that way, but the first step to recovery is acknowledging your issues, and it looks like you have them figured out.  Good luck with it!

If your dog can wear the largest size,then [here](http://www.petexpectations.com/LupineOakandMaple1WideAdjustableCollar.aspx) is that exact collar for sale! They also appear to have a lot of other retired Lupine patterns.   Also, it's worth checking out other retailers who carry Lupine. I wanted to find a particular retired Lupine pattern for a rescue that always uses a very particular pattern of collar for their dogs, and was able to find tons of them (I just checked, though, and that place doesn't have the pattern you're looking for).
So, here's my advice: Ditch your war bag, you don't need it. Carry on your Alphas in your garment bag, DON'T WEAR THEM ON THE FUCKING PLANE. Pack all the shit you were issued in your sea bags, check those. Get an actual carry on sized piece of luggage, backpack, small duffel bag, whatever you want, but use this as your carry on for your cammies that you'll change into immediately after you check in to ITB. When you arrive at your final airport, there will be a locker room for you to change into your alphas in.

I'm actually interested in why you don't like Smash 4 Wii U, could you elaborate?
I can tolerate religion without accepting it.  They're not the same thing. Tolerance is necessary, acceptance is personal.  "gay people are free to do as they please" is different from "being gay is totally cool"  One is necessary, the other is just preferable.  You also conflate "racist jokes" with actual racism.  To me, this may say more about you than you may wish. I'm of the opinion that when EVERYONE can be the subject of jokes, we'll have accomplished something.  What do I mean?  In the UK, we mock each other. The North and South exchange insults, the nations exchange insults even different areas in the same towns exchange insults.  Sometimes it's nasty. When done by nasty individuals.  Most of the time it's not only benign, it's an expression of affection and shared heritage.  The Irish and the English can throw around banter, insult each other's nations, accent or (perceived general) appearance. When I was a boy, Irish terrorists were blowing up buildings, sectarian violence was rife and some of the Irish people I know tell of being treated with great suspicion and even antagonism.  I for one think that being free to mock each other is part of what helps mend these rifts.  To allude to America, when Chris Rock makes *extremely* prejudicial jokes, no body can possible assume malice. What they can do is laugh at themselves, laugh at the problems and maybe come to understand those problems a little better.

I'm a fan of both Dizaster and DFD and I think minus the little corny "here and there" moments I have to say that I liked DFD's rounds more. Dizaster's first round was pretty good, his second round he spazzed, and third was pretty good but I so feel he gets way more reaction out of his bars. When DFD said his punches never really land its most true. And a lot of his bars/stereotypical jokes we just plain weak. DFD 2-1

My overall budget for a non-EOS router, L3 switch and L2 switch would be about $4,500 total.   Yes, non-EOS so that I can apply security patches when vulnerabilities are released.   For some reason, my initial findings on searching cablesandkits always showed non-3850 modesl of 3750 as only having 10/100, but now that I search for the one that you mention, with the "G" at the end, they're all comming up as 10/100/1000. Wow -- Cisco device models are a real maze if you're new. I'm trying to get the newest equipment that I can afford within my budget (it can expand if need by, but not grossly) - so that I can get more service life out of it. Unfortunately, just one Cisco 3850 blows away the budget.  Thanks for the hint! Still trying to find a nifty chart for which model numbers are newer, something like  Cisco 3750 begat Cisco 3750G Begat 3750V2 Begat 3750-X begat 3850 (may be out of order, but something like this woudl be usesful... with the dates they were relased and EOL/EOS) But I digress. Thanks again!
The Keyword is *my* top 10. I don't see why GGG should be in his top 10, seriously, why the fuck should GGG automatically be considered top 10 worthy? Going purely on accomplishments I could name 10 boxers easily with a more established resume than GGG who also were strong boxers. Ward is definitely among that list, Ward is without a doubt in my mind a superior boxer to GGG.  Deontay Wilder gets shit for beating on tomato cans whereas GGG gets a free pass. Floyd gets shit for refusing to move up for the SIXTH FUCKING TIME in his career (never MIND the fact that he's *retired*) to face GGG whereas GGG gets  free pass from refusing to move up for the FIRST TIME in his career (by the age of 34~) to face Ward.   Mother fuck this cancerous wave of GGGapologists. Fuck em right in the pussy.

What do you mean "what should I put it as next"?  As long as this post is still open and has the "needs review" flair, a mod will eventually come by and take a look at your model.  Then they will either "mod approve" it if they think it's alright or write down in the comments what they think needs work.  Also, be patient; it might take time for mods to review threads because there's so many opened and only a few can review or have limited "mod approves" that they can give out.

Is that an indicator that I will never have to rely on such a service? Absolutely not.  However, the decision should be my own and the rep completely disregarded that decision.  You're doing a lot to change my perception of the cynicism and mockery adopted by Sprint reps when confronted with a legitimate complaint.

BOTH OF YOU SHUT YOUR FACES! DESIGN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ELO OR RANK. FYI I'M NOT EVEN LEVEL 15 BUT MY DESIGNS ARE FOR THE MOST PART WELL RECEIVED AND BALANCED. LIGHTNIN0 BEING CONDESCENDING ISN'T PART OF LEAVING CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK WHICH IS ONE OF THE FORUM RULES AND IVERSITHYY YOU TOO. Lightnin0 i have read that vlad is in fact able to be damaged by aoe nontargetting spells while in pool form. But, i have yet to try it so don't rant on me either. This thread was utterly pointless and a waste of all of our time. If someone doesn't want to change their design then leave them be. And if someone offers actual legitimate criticism then try to be accommodating and not reiterate the same facts over and over. An example of this happens to be a thread I had with lightnin0 on my design of Vivatrox. https://www.reddit.com/r/LoLChampConcepts/comments/3jjv9x/vivatrox_the_darkin_helix/  **read lightnin0 and my comments to each other**. In this thread there was no anger, insults or degenerate comments. Even though I disagreed with lightnin0 it didn't end with a shouting match. That's how comments should be handled. Thats my 2 cents.

Having your body develop quickly but your interests develop slowly sucks.  That certainly describes me at 14.  It's worth remembering that just a few generations ago a 14 year old kid would have been playing with dolls.  Being into drawing horses and watching stupid television is **not** a problem. I understand it may fit into the same pattern of seeming "young", but they are **taste** choices you need to respect.  If you forbid her from harmless expression of herself, you're just taking away her autonomy more -- and what she needs is to grow up and actually develop autonomy. (This doesn't mean you should give her free reign to do things that are actively harmful to others: force her to shower, punish her for using your things without permission, etc.)  It seems like she needs to be put in a situation where she needs to show competence, and where someone (not you; you've got enough on your plate) is there to help her and hold her feet to the fire and not let her panic and leave.  Maybe it's going camping with a group, or volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, or building a backyard treehouse.  Some activity where it's guaranteed that something will go wrong, but also where it will be within her competence (with help) to fix it.  Basically, exposure therapy for her fear of things going wrong.
I will not. And that's because I didn't actually decide to leave. I was removed.  When I announced my departure, I was purposefully vague to protect myself. Explosm posted their response with something about "we talked and made a decision." That "we" never included me. They talked about it and they decided to kick me out. I was never in favor of the decision, haha.  One week I was in Dallas with my friends signing a metric ton of merchandise as rewards for the Kickstarter backers, the next week I'm being told that I'm getting kicked out of the company.

No, if a kid dies because he takes some drugs that haven't been registered with the school then it's *criminal negligence*. If the school has a policy that all necessary medication has to be registered with them and the parents know of that policy it's safer for a teacher to assume that any not registered medication is not necessary. Because if it would have been necessary it would have been registered with them wouldn't it?

This is something I've struggled with recently. What makes a good person? How much do actions and thoughts determine this?   Try this, do something helpful for someone who can't pay you back. Maybe you take a homeless dude to lunch, maybe you help an old Asian lady change her flat tire, whatever. If you act like a good person long enough, you will become a good person.   It's like my old mentor Paarthurnax always used to say " which is better? To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort"   That being said, the fact that you contain enough empathy to worry that you might be an asshole is probably indicative of the fact that you're worrying about this more than most people.   Try to do good more than you do bad, and realize that no one is really keeping track.   Hope my experiences add some insight to your question!

It's pretty good.   To be fair, I wasn't always super happy. I was in a shit relationship with an asshole who could find ways to be a miserable jackass on a beach in Maui. He wasted his life on being a manchild, and then acted surprised when he gained weight, lost his stamina, didn't want to leave the house, and was miserable all the time, then blamed it on me, on his employers, on not having a better job handed to him, etc., and refused to seek help, saying it was my fault, and if everyone just gave him more stuff, and left him alone, he'd be happy.   Eventually he cheated on me and walked out, and I was fucked up. Lost my job in the same week, and found out the creepy slut he'd been banging gave me an STD, and was on antibiotics for a month. Needless to say I was pretty low, and felt pretty worthless. I mean, how bad do you have to be for a 30-something unemployed manchild to walk out on you?!  Within a few months, I felt like I was given a second life. I could suddenly do all the stuff I loved without him making fun of me. I could eat the food I liked without him complaining, and I didn't have this constant, oppressive, negative weight coming down on everything I did. To say it was liberating is the understatement of the year.   It's been 4 years, and I love everything now. I can travel and see great places, and it's made so much better by being able to enjoy a culture, and not listen to bitching about people not speaking English, or having to eat at McDonald's in Rome, or Vienna, or Edinburgh (yes, this actually happened). I can listen to the music I love, and share it with people I love. I can develop myself and improve, have a nice home that I can keep clean, and every day he's not around I'm grateful for everything I have, and so happy to not be a punching bag (literal and metaphorical) for someone else's shit.   Yeah, I have bad days, and not everything is always great, but I wasted 10 years carrying around someone else's self-loathing, depression, and blame, and I'm never going to spend another day that way. And it feels fucking awesome!

You look like you stole money from your father while he was passed out drunk, as per usual, and bought a wig. Then you stole your sister's blouse and dress up in drag to try to better understand the plight of women. Jesus, can't you just play video games like a regular teenaged virgin boy? 
So excited for Stephanie and the location is perfect, it's just far enough from the similar options of Portage Grounds, Mia's, and Perkolator. I daresay we are becoming dotted with cafés.  Perkolator used to sell their kolaczki but they have not had it for a while and they told me they don't carry them anymore because they don't sell and I thought that was nuts, they are perfect, light as a feather with just the right amount of fruit filling. When those movie people were here I offered one to a crew member from California and she had never heard of them or had one before and loved them.

Also, 2.4 GHz is an unlicensed frequency, just like 900MHz &amp; 5.8GHz. Your wireless router runs on 2.4GHz, your bluetooth, your xbox &amp; ps4 controllers, your dog's wireless fence, etc., all share this same band. So does all of your neighbor's wireless stuff. The FCC places rather extreme limits on everything to minimize how much they interfere.  If you have paid ridiculous amounts of money to buy your own spectrum at auction, however, the limits are much higher, because they leave the interference management to you.  Your wireless router breaks the 2400-2499 MHz range up into 11 channels, each 9MHz apart . A cell phone company might buy spectrum in the 700-730 MHz range and with more expensive &amp; sensitive equipment break this up into 10 channels, each 3 MHz apart. Then they carefully engineer which channel each sector on each tower is set to, much like a 4-color map, so they minimize as much as possible any of these sectors being near each other or facing each other to minimize interference.

&gt; but why do you believe she is untrustworthy, and a secondary question, if you do in fact have legitimate reasons to find her untrustworthy why is she more untrustworthy than any other run of the mill politician?  If I were some kind of attorney, I would propose you investigate Hillary and her time listed in this summary page: http://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/  I'd ask that you be thorough and yes, publicly release emails like Presidential candidates should do.  Benghazi in particular. The destabilization efforts and overthrow of the Lybian dictatorship was definitely a manipulation by the US gov.  The Military is suffering from incomplete missions and essentially the public resignation of major military staff.  Your military should testify that arms from stockpiles of the Lybian Government were purposely "leaked" our courriered into Syria. cough:P (...isis) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Lower case We are at war with a terrible and un ending threat at the United States.  The careful manipulation of Governments over decades is now coming back to bite us.  These people are not toys of our government.  They are human beings that deserve honesty and justice.  LET THEM SORT THIS OUT.  Now were in more danger than I can recall in my 32 yr lifetime.  This is a global issue.  And yes I am implying that O and HC are basically lying to the world and they commit fraud and murder.  YEP  Investigte your candidate guys.  Most all of them, in court.  They deserve careful inspection by the people.  Like a reality show.  Constant observation and investigation.  INVESTIGATE HILLARY DON"T VOTE FOR THIS WOMAN I support : • Feeding the poor • Educating the poor • Fair and equitable treatment at the workplace, including industry standard pay and representation • A representive democracy of the strong branches of Gov that actually CHECK and then BALANCE  soooooooo, no justice????  WE NEED PROTECTION from corporations and Government.  I have to vote for this woman????  I'm a 15 year Democrat.  I was abled to vote in 2002.  I hate the GOP.  I have no defense for the current Democratic party, infact I am totally baffled.  I demand answers.  I will not even vote for this woman.  I'm not voting.... plan B

I was working at a coffee shop at the time and a guy went into the bathroom and he didn't come out for 20 minutes. My boss walks into the bathroom and notices that he has locked himself in the stall and is moaning and what not.  My boss and I think that he's doing drugs so my boss call the cops and the cops come. Once the cops get there, they go into the bathroom to assess the information.   The dude in the bathroom had really bad diarrhea and pretty much shit everywhere in the stall...

So true. People want balance but the scaled seem to always be tipped heavily towards one side. I can't agree that Chow can even be remotely considered good in the slightest because of how much shit I went through during highschool when it first came out. I don't think I can get past the hate for Ken because of how his roles affected me in real life.. so no Ken's roles did not "destroy" stereotypes at all and only reinforced them in my mind. 
The best thing about Abbott's demise is that it's not even his legacy that's being dismantled, it's what he wanted to be his legacy but was too incompetent to actually achieve.  The best argument that he might not be the worst PM in history is that he failed to actually do much. He really isn't going to be that remembered in the history books at all.
There are stark similarities. Extreme economic opportunity moves into an area with very little available housing.  Does this mean in the end Levi's is gonna be the only one actually getting rich?
That would be the worst thing that could ever happen to college sports.   &gt;Not how the few aggressively pursued highschool athletes are paid, through either gifts of cars or other valuables or donations to their family members.  Putting athletes on a payroll solves none of this, it just opens the floodgates for more abuse.

This happened a lot to me when our baby was small and what I figured out is it was because the inserts were bunching up and not going close enough to the seams.

I literally just don't care enough. 
&gt;When I say "infrastructure", I'm including electric, water, and sewer systems; roads, busses, trains, airports, and other transportation; telecom/cable/internet; and regulatory apparatus like, for example, the FDA. Of these, maybe transportation has convex costs in population...  Aside from maybe the FDA I think all the other instances of infrastructure are going to increase with density.  Building anything that would require taking infrastructure offline will probably incur higher congestion costs.  Building higher, which a denser area would necessitate, costs more per area than something on the ground.  A runway needs to occupy a minimum amount of area.  Land costs more in denser areas so property aquistion would also costs more.  (Tokyo thought it would be cheaper just to build an artificial island as an airport than try to obtain the land). &gt;...benefits  So just so we're on the same page you're claiming that there are increasing marginal benefits to infrastructure with increasing density?  I'm going to have to think on that.  I will say that overcapacity is an issue.  So while a higher density may cause a particular piece of infrastructure to be used its optimal capacity it may also  cause it to operate at overcapacity.  Like grid locked roads or subway trains that are so packed the doors have trouble closing.   &gt;He's complaining about the effects of mass immigration, which 1. the US saw on a much larger scale than he's fretting about from ~140 years ago to ~80 years ago, and  2. made the US unambiguously better off.   I'd argue that our country has changed quite a bit since the era of mass migration.  We aren't a small agrarian country with a population of &lt;5M desperately needing bodies to occupy the western territories before the European powers grabbed it.  I don't think the "kick open the floodgates" approach to immigration is going to work this time around.  Where's the demand for low-skilled labor like there was during mid-1800's to early-1900's?  Where's the Frontier?  I think we should look to other OECD countries for guidance.  Is Canada letting in millions of immigrants a year regardless of their economic situation?  Is Norway?  I mean why can't we be strategic about who we let in so we can get the most bang for our buck?  
I should also add separately my advice on trading with Talon against mages.  I notice that a lot of Talons retreat the second they take some un-anticipated damage. In actuality, against mages your best bet is to retaliate immediately. It is not like fighting an Irelia or a Jax where they have sustained damage.   All mages suffer from pretty lengthy cool downs and their AA's usually barely tickle (aside from some passive infused ones like Lux or Ziggs).  And like I said above, if they are stupid enough to either 1) miss you with their CC's skill, or 2) use it to CS - IMMEDIATELY punish them for it.  Disclaimer - playing talon aggressively requires good warding and mini-map awareness.  Talon can be played more passively until 6 to go for the ult kill - but I find I can usually get a kill pre-6 and basically shut down midlane from there.

I like the way you put it. I think owning cars is going to follow a similar path to owning firearms. Long time ago everyone had a gun, then guns aren't really needed anymore, so it became less popular. Then regulations cut down the ownership more. Then something like today where there's going to be some number of people owning them and it's a pretty big community of people, but it's largely separate from the public. Any time it's brought up that a person owns one, the first question is most likely "Why the heck do you own one anyway?"

Well...science is not really just a methodology. (Step 1: Hypothesis! Step 2: Apparatus! Step X: Graphs! like in grade school.) It's also a set of principles; the methods used are merely whatever is currently thought to be the best way to uphold those principles while advancing knowledge. One of those principles -- a fundamentally important one -- is that the final arbiter of what to believe in should always be real-world evidence, and that relying on anything else is a no-no.  I am going to try to avoid making any unpleasant claims, but it could be argued that religious faith, although obviously present in many excellent scientists, is still an example of unscientific thought, since it is a conclusion drawn from something other than empirically-tested theory.
Of course not.

&gt;"I was prompted to do this as a few of my normal legal packages had tears, or had been opened and resealed."   Well ok that seems fair enough. I'm not entirely sure of the relevance to the coke orders since they're on drop addresses with presumably fake names (otherwise OP is a real bonafide dipshit) but I guess some paranoia and questioing is to be expected when you're ordering over 10 grands worth of cocaine at a time.  &gt;It is entirely reasonable that a postman would recognize a darknet-looking package and try to see what's in it.   And by the very next line I'm lost again. This theory only makes any form of sense if a DNM package and a legit package aren't immediately seperable, which you seem to think they are immediately seperable. So what else is meant to be going on in this scenario? Is this one postie indiscriminately stealing from every package that comes his way? Is there more than 1 postie involved? Are they opening packages for phone chargers and shit people bought on ebay? How are they getting away with this with no one reporting anything? OP said he has many drop addresses all over QLD, so how the fuck is he getting the same postie nicking his shit? Are the cops the ones tampering with his legit packages? How many parties are involved here? If it's getting nicked at the sorting warehouse for a region or even at the post office itself then how the fuck is anyone there able to pick through the packages? They would be handling 10X the mail the local postman does. QLD isn't Vatican City, it's a huge state and millions of people live there.  &gt;This has happened before. Is it really that unbelievable?  I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just so stupidly unlikely that it goes waaaayyyyy past it ever being plausible, like being bitten by a shark whilst being struck by lightning. 1 big order being pinched by a postie that knows what they're looking for? Maybe thats possible. 3 times, going to 2 different addresses and once being packaged and mailed by OP himself instead of the coke vendor? lolololol.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but shouldn't this school district's policy not apply to a medication that's considered life saving? I feel like there should be some type of limitation on enforcing this rule - like in the event of an emergency, the child can use the inhaler or epipen and then they can carefully document the event to cover their ass if necessary. Similar to what an emergency room would do: should a patient present with a life threatening condition, heroic measures are taken to save his/her life unless they have an advance directive that states otherwise.  Shouldn't the priority be the kid's life here? I'm a nursing student nearing graduation and have spent the past few months in the pediatric critical care setting. This article made me cringe.
