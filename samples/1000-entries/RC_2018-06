Following up on one question hanging in the air:  &gt;equation of tangent of circle is x.x1+y.y1=a¬≤  *When does that work?*  ONLY for a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius a.  ONLY for finding a tangent line through a known of tangency (x1, y1) on the circle itself.  *Why does it work?*  Segment from center (0, 0) to known point (x1, y1) on circle has slope y1/x1.  Slope of the tangent line that contains (x1, y1) will be negative reciprocal, which is ‚Äìx1/y1, because tangent is perpendicular to the radius.  Point (x1, y1) is on the tangent line and ‚Äìx1/y1 is the slope. Use point-slope form.  y ‚Äì y1 = ‚Äì(x1/y1)(x ‚Äì x1)  Multiply both sides by y1.  y.y1 ‚Äì y1.y1 = ‚Äìx.x1 + x1.x1  Rearrange terms.  x.x1 + y.y1 = x1.x1 + y1.y1  But x1^2 + y1^2 = a^2 because (x1, y1) is on the circle with radius a.  x.x1 + y.y1 = a^2  I repeat: That works only to find tangent to point (x1, y1) on a circle with radius a that has center (0, 0). It does not work for any problem where circle is not centered at (0, 0), and it does not work for any problem asking for equation of tangent line when point of tangency isn't given.

Trying to find a word I've heard a few times that seems to be the equivalent of the command "heel!", "calm!", or something similar to those words in the context of commanding a dog/animal (ex. you say strongly and loudly, while pointing at the dog, "stop!"). The word sounded like "haaus!" or  "„ÅØ„ÅÜ„Åô!".   Couldn't find anything on any online dictionaries, any help is appreciated!

Yung wala ka ng feelings para sa SO mo tapos ayaw mo pang ikaw makipag break, siya nalang yung gumagawa ng paraan para sa relationship niyo tapos ikaw yung wala lang kasi ayaw mo na. Yung ginagago mo na lang siya para siya na lang yung makipagbreak.   Ako 'yon dati eh, tangina sinayang ko lang oras namen and lalo ko lang siyang nasaktan. Now I realize na napaka asshole nun and sometimes its better to just end it and save you both the time and more heartaches.

I live. My wife's from here, and I work from home, doing freelance stuff. Was in a band for a while, we even got paid to play, so I was a semi-pro musician for a short time, too. It was fun, but we got a kid, so I had to cut short on touring time, left the band.  Not all foreigners in China are expats, living in a foreign bubble, and between the wife's family and friends and the local friends I made, social life is pretty much as active as back home. Kid's growing up, taking quite a big chunk of my time, and I wonder when I'll be able to get back to playing music with said friends, but on the whole, life's not bad.   I do miss cheese and not overpriced palatable beer, though. But the local fare is very good, too, even if I grow bored of rice from time to time.  I guess you could say I came for the girl and stayed for the food?

It is more or less a boilerplate with framework characteristics. Boilerplate usually just take a thin layer of prepared code for you with some best practices, this though gives you a convention that is flexible with simple configurations.  there is no common ground with flask\-restful to compare them to each other, here we have a built\-in multi ORM support \(SQLAlchemy \+ sqlalchemy\-mixins included, Orator, Pony\), DB migrations, although there are a lot need to be redesigned, and I'm working on it, for example migration for different ORMs still being executed using the same command, I have to separate them.  Thanks for your suggestion.

Yep OpTic surprised me how dominant they were, and it was great to watch. However we must remember it was only 1 league match, and not get ahead of ourselves. Feel sorry for Formal after everything he has done for OpTic, and I am sure he will turn things round. It is such a shame that old OpTic did not go their separate ways on better terms. Great performances from everyone on OpTic ,and hopefully this is the start of another successful journey .
I like more basic sets. I prefer that to the overly flashy bullshit.  Btw, the PA is I think a vampire count set repurposed to this....the Necro on screams grey seer.......  I like the pango one..thats what I think sets should be like more than the overly flashy, particle vomit we've been getting.  Different people have different tastes.  Its pretty sad that you think your aesthetic opinion is the only "legitmate" view on the matter.

The NDP have real solid plans to support rural and northern communities. Building a road to the Ring of Fire in the north to support resource development and create local jobs. Bringing broad band support to rural and northern communities. Improving rail infrastructure in northern communities. Promoting smelting activities in Sudbury.   I know some people paint supporting unions as a negative thing but they‚Äôre so important, unions are the ones who fought for and got everyone labour rights. Union jobs are what supported my family growing up. Most of my family is or has been part of a union at some point and I don‚Äôt know that we would have been able to have a middle class life otherwise. Unions cover such a large portion of the population that they really just represent the regular working person.   The NDP have solid plans for pharmacare which might sound expensive but when we, the people of Ontario, are a single bargaining unit we can achieve better deals across the board from drug companies on prescription costs.   I could go on but there‚Äôs a lot of reasons why te NDP are a good choice and not just a protest vote. I‚Äôm clearly biased form the amount of info I have about the NDP but I have read the PC and liberal plans as well. As an NDP voter I actually supported the potential government of Patrick Brown (or even Christine Elliot) and could see myself being convinced to be a moderate PC voter but Doug Ford is not a competent politician and not a good representative for the PC brand.

Okay I'm sorry, but... this is so untrue, it's insane. I'm anti-SJW as all hell but this edit is such bullshit.  Feminine behavior is not encouraged in males at all. Many of us get rejected and disowned by our peers and families for being LGBT or not being "masculine". Why are butch women treated better by society than femme men?  I wish it was even accepted- take back all the years of bullying and rejection I've faced.   I love this sub but, unless this is a very new thing, this couldn't be more false. And I'm 25, not that old.

It's from an old saying, "why buy the cow when you're getting the milk for free?" It's from the mindset of a woman who wants to get married. The logic is that if she has sex with her man, he will be less likely to want to marry her, because he's already getting the thing he wants.

&gt;My bet is she isn't catholic.  And if she is Catholic just read about the [Misserere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_(Allegri\)):  * Composed around 1638, Miserere was the last and most famous of twelve falsobordone settings used at the Sistine Chapel since 1514. At some point, it became forbidden to transcribe the music and it was allowed to be performed only at those particular services at the Sistine Chapel, thus adding to the mystery surrounding it.  * According to the popular story (backed up by family letters), fourteen-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was visiting Rome when he first heard the piece during the Wednesday service. Later that day, he wrote it down entirely from memory, returning to the Chapel that Friday to make minor corrections. Less than three months after hearing the song and transcribing it, Mozart had gained fame for the work and was summoned to Rome by Pope Clement XIV, who showered praise on him for his feat of musical genius and awarded him the Chivalric Order of the Golden Spur on July 4, 1770.  So unauthorized copying of a protected work was not only tolerated by but applauded by the Pope.

In the cases of things like fetal alcohol syndrome, which is entirely preventible and a well understood risk, I can't see how anyone can argue that the mother should not be held responsible.   Addiction is no excuse.  If you drive a car drunk and seriously injure a passenger in the back seat, you still get into trouble and are held responsible, no matter if you're an addict.  Why should it be any different for an internal passenger if you will?  Perhaps a good solution is that once the baby is born, the mother can be aborted.

bloodthinner didn't post the idea completely.  CDC recommends the simple exam mask for basic care of a flu patient, but then recommends the N95 or better for any activity that bodily fluids can become aerosolized.  Large droplet protection is all that is required for most interactions, but increased protection for particulate and aerosolization precautions when necessary. 
Try one of their mock tests. When you get more than 70%, you're probably ready, except maybe for the parts you can't really test without feedback like conversations or writing a text.  You could post your text here to get feedback.  The speaking part is very basic: [http://bfu.goethe.de/a1_sd1/sprechen.php](http://bfu.goethe.de/a1_sd1/sprechen.php). First you have to introduce yourself according to the key words ("Ich hei√üe ... Ich komme aus..."), then you have to ask for or give informations based on key words (e.g. "Fr√ºhst√ºck" -&gt; "Isst du Fr√ºhst√ºck?" -&gt; "Ja.") and then say something or react to someone based on pictures (e.g. CD -&gt; "Wo ist die CD?" -&gt; "Zu Hause.")  When people are able to understand you, because they *really* want to understand you, you're fine. So making lots and lots of insignificant mistakes or having a really strong accent might not be a big problem.
I didn't present them cause it wasn't the point of the discussion. Im just saying that you cant vote based on personality traits. Especially when it doesn't show up in their platform.  If want to have a *political* discussion, we can have one.  I for one don't agree with NDP policies at all and I'm curious has to why people think they're better than the PC's. For starters I think not taxing minimum wage workers is probably smart, I think i can see where hes trying to go with this.  1. I think its going to improve economy even if its by a little bit. \(With things like spending on products and services and moving cash in the country\). 2. Students are able to keep more money to pay back student loans a little bit quicker, an extra 500\-800 dollars is a 1/3 of a college semester so that might help give some leverage with paying back student debt. 3. It allows a poorer families with minimum wage jobs to help pay for food, rent, etc.  I also think scrapping carbon tax is ultimately good. I don't think we can force green innovation by throwing a ton of our money at it. It seems like its better if we encourage companies to foot the green innovation by minimizing the regulation and encourage companies to innovate themselves as they are the suppliers of all things that emit carbon. They hold a ton of the technology that helps run things more efficiently and more green.   Reducing small business tax is HUGE. People like Walmart destroy local competition and this would provide an amazing edge to startups and local mom and pop shops and the like. It would create a more competitive and healthier economy.   As far as I'm concerned, hes not being transparent on the budget, which is severely hurting his image. It sucks that the OPC chose Doug. However i don't think we should undermine the entire PC party for that. I think they will not do as bad as everyone says they will.  Now on the NDP side of things,   She promised global health care, which is one of the biggest destroyer of economies and the biggest contributors to debt. I am all for giving Ontario free health care, however its a little silly that anyone can just come through the border and receive treatment for no cost. Medical isn't cheap and it shows in our national debt. If you look at the debt before Pierre Trudeau took power and the debt 20 years later. Its essentially a slope way upwards. Which is the cost of keeping people alive. Don't get me wrong i think its amazing that we have healthcare for our citizens and I like the system as it is. However if we release it to the entire world to get free treatment. Its going to hurt us big time.   That being said I don't like PC's position on privatizing it. However they weren't transparent on that either. So I can't comment too much on that.   Package all of that and the huge game with identity politics. I don't think anyone is stupid for picking PC as a potential candidate to take over.   
Would it be more work/money than putting in a big window?

wtf.  &gt;[A further inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_(The_X-Files)#Writing) came from a story in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home. After dinner, the family took him upstairs to meet their son, pulling him out from under a bed. The son \("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat\-shaped head, a sickening white face, a sunken nose, a large mouth," according to Chaplin\) "flopp\[ed\] around" while they sang and danced.

I think maybe just have it come cumulatively as opposed to set damage ticks that other players get. Instead of regular storm damage at all stages the damage could slowly build up, from 1-1-2-2-3-3 etc per tick. Maybe also have a movement speed buff in the storm to make up for this nerf.

I've been the main breadwinner in my relationship for a few years while my partner has been working through some serious mental health problems. I've also put a lot of emotional labor into helping him. He shows his appreciation not only by taking my own anxiety seriously and helping me when I need it, but literally just thanking me. Sometimes he gives a very serious "thank you, I appreciate you so much", and it really helps me. He also got me a nice card out of the blue once with an inside joke on it :) 
Yeah it's weird, we don't even know if he carries it around like Sasuke does.

+1 for picks matter. I keep about four different sizes and weights in my gig bag because they all have different attack, tone, and feel. Including felt picks, which I absolutely love. 
Lol I like how you compare gendercritical (a sub that doesn't "call for men's balls to be chopped off", but criticizes systematic oppression) to incels that want to legally rape women. Men literally killing and raping women is barely called what it is (a hate crime against women and a symptom of the society we live in) but women who point it out are basically nazis. It's the sex version of r/vegan. 
Oh fuck off

Dialects of living languages have to be constantly diverging almost by definition -- it's one of the effects of the language being in constant, daily use, and being learned from the cradle. When a language becomes increasingly fixed, less commonly used, and stops being learned from the cradle, it dies.  There are arguments about communications technologies viz. language, but I think what some of these arguments miss is that these technologies change the *rate* of language divergence -- not the underlying processes of divergence itself -- by providing a sort of reference standard that is a bit more fixed than the way the local aristocrats (or equivalent) talk.   Languages with extensive written traditions, for example, especially in a manner where the writing reflects the phonology, tend to diverge much more slowly than fully oral languages -- but it's *also* true that in many examples of languages with extensive written traditions (like Latin), the written standard is wholly reflective of the prestige register and can often mask or obfuscate changes in colloquial speech over time.  More questions come about now because with modern recording technology, we can preserve ways people *talk* that was simply never available until the 20th century. But even then, consider that the prestige register of [Mid-Atlantic English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent), which was popular among the pre-jet age equivalent of jet-setters, is now basically dead.
Did you fix the trap challenge?!?!
Ah ok, thanks. 
&gt;My desire is to discover the secret to the mystery.   Presumably if your gripe in this very context is not being pulled in after one page, there's more pleasure to be had in reading than revealing mystery. You can't divorce the sense of being "compelled" by a story from gratification. Which is why I said your statement is disingenuous.   One could allude to a musician toiling away at producing an album. In one instance there's gratification in having completed the project. Playing music is in and of itself gratifying, however - some will describe it as not being a job at all, for that reason. There's perpetual moments of gratification alongside delayed gratification (for mystery, in your case).

I've seen white and red on the paratroopers but as far as I know blue military face paint has never existed since blue is a highly visible color.
It's not just gaming either.  I remember people bitching and moaning about Jason Momoa being cast as the new Conan the Barbarian and Aquaman because he wasn't white enough.  Personally I think Jason Momoa was fucking awesome as Conan and would have loved to have seen an entire television series of it.  I can't comment on Aquaman though as I've got superhero movie fatigue and haven't watched any of that shit since Ironman 2.

Youth policy. He's playing okay a VFL but I think the writing is on the wall. It's a shame because in the short term I think his presence would help us win games but probably hold back Timmy O and guys like Mitch Lewis.... Shoey is one of my favourites and I hope he gets a few more games...
is there a name for this angle?

A Canuck Navy Reservist living in Southern Ontario?  Good!  Those Ohioans on the other side of the lake can get unruly at times, best to have some men at the ready.  Oh, and if you need ideas on how to invade Ohio, just watch the big D-Day reenactment that takes place in Conneaught, to the east of Cleveland. Just leave the surrounding states out of it and you'll be good.  Bonus points if you take out a few Ohio Big 10 sports teams while you're at it.
Maybe talk to her about it, give her a warning aboit how this will go down if she doesnt change. 
This is already decoded, and information is available in the wiki [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantment_Table#Standard_Galactic_Alphabet).  The words that show up in the enchantment table selection are chosen at random from the list and have absolutely no bearing on the type of enchantment(s) that will be given by the choice.  Edit:  The file name that stores the characters is assets/minecraft/textures/font/ascii_sga.png if you feel like extracting and modifying it and replacing them with regular characters.  I'm not aware offhand of any resource packs that do this, but it's not difficult to make.

To be honest OP, I'm not sure what was up with your parents but high risk pregnancies involving hospitalisation implies accidental pregnancy - especially if your younger siblings are only a year apart.  Either that or do your parents come from a religious sect that frowns on contraception or were any of your younger siblings twins? Cause high risk pregnancies usually means the doctors don't recommend subsequent pregnancies (and certainly would be pulling in the mother the moment she fell pregnant again).  In any case, your dad shouldn't be shoving responsibility on you to support your family.  But I think he's probably scared and trying to make himself feel better that even though he's basically failed at making sure his children will be okay, that you'll be there. This is very unfair on you.  You're only in your mid twenties, and you should never have been made to bring up kids when you were still a kid yourself.  But - unless you want to cut off your dying father, your mother and your four younger siblings, it is what it is.  Maybe your mother can be encouraged to go back to work once your younger siblings are old enough not to require as much supervision.  And hopefully your father has a peaceful death.  Your siblings will grow up and with your encouragement and help, they'll know how to save money and live a better life so they don't need to lean on you financially. I guess what I'm saying is that you're in a catch 22 - you can't take back your lost childhood, and you can't drop the responsibility of financially supporting your family without losing your family.  But at least it isn't forever.  Your younger siblings will graduate from school and will learn to support themselves (you should have a talk with them soon though about how much you can provide for their college educations so they can be ready to get scholarships and loans like you did) - and you can help your mother be better prepared for retirement than she is at the moment. With regards to your boyfriend though... Do you love your family? Does he know this? Cause if he does, him saying you should stop helping them is sort of sociopathic.  It feels a bit odd that this guy has been dating you this long and be completely uncaring about your family.   Anyway, if he wants to resign and invest his savings then he can - but he has to do it on his dime.  That means he should have enough savings to keep paying his share of the rent, the utilities, the food and luxuries bill while he plays around with his savings.  That's how it works when you start playing with becoming independently wealthy with savings.  Also, as much as being in a relationship means supporting your partner - that doesn't mean sacrificing your financial stability and happiness so they can freeload.  If he wants to do this and you agree to basically being his financial safety net while he screws around, then there has to be rules in place.  Stuff like "how much money do you need to be able to generate to do this for longer than [x] period of time" and "what constitutes enough money to not work" and "when do you go back to work".  Though to be honest, OP, I'd have dumped him when he was saying I should cut off my parents and younger siblings (who are all 13 and younger?) who were more or less dependent on my earning capacity to stay above the poverty line.  It's just so ... coldly sociopathic.
Can confirm, so damn good!
I could have sworn it was a Jamaican accent. Interesting thought about it. Not sure I subscribe. This is more of fan theory?
Did you forget when the idea of teaching Ebonics in schools was popular for a minute? We're getting there.
I thought this America

I‚Äôm in the same place. While I am clearly and openly at odds with the teachings I haven‚Äôt cut the final cord because my parents watch my kids. But I can say that my youngest starts Kindergarten this year and I am getting a pretty big promotion. As soon as I can afford before/after care or a Nanny for after school I‚Äôm doing it. I need to feel and know that part of my life is behind me. But I will loose almost all of my family. It‚Äôs hard. 
Ehhhhh!! Me too! Except mine was used and 2007. Oh my lanta...is there a night and day difference in feel. Positive of course. I agree with the sounds, definitely could use more bass. Looking to add a powered truck sub in the back or a custom corner enclosure very soon.   If you ever get speaker door rattle like I did for my front passenger side; my dealership wouldn't fix anything. They just said that's normal for high bass range in music. I took the door panel off and added foam strips and solved it myself.

That's a tax writeoff lol
I feel as if the term "religious freedom" is a bit nebulous in this scenario.  When you say this, do you mean it in the sense that people should be free to worship without any restraint?  One concept that I actually really like comes from the Islamic Middle Ages. Perhaps you've heard of it, but Islamic states instituted a system in which *dhimmi* or "people of the book", who were practitioners of religions related to Islam (most notably Christianity and Judaism), were permitted to practice their faith so long as they submitted to the Islamic authorities, notably through a religious tax system.  I think that this sort of system provides the best balance between "free" practice of religion and maintaining the dominance of the state religion.

To be fair, Real Madrid last couple seasons have just been crossing the ball.. Not exactly brilliant football either. Also wasn't a big fan of our midfield having trouble getting to our forwards properly against Bayern and Liverpool. As soon as teams pressure hard we just keep passing it backward.

Good call! Yeah now the FHA PMI IS FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR to me that‚Äôs insane. Fucking insane!

I'd go Tim Smith over Rocky. Rocky is a bit risky still and Smith looks like a great cash cow. Rocky's BE is around 70 so if he has another great game he should stay under 600k and be great value.

&gt;An optimistic hero's journey character people looked up to and admired  That journey doesn't end at the age of twenty-three. When we last left him in *ROTJ*, he'd barely started.  &gt;its like if you make a Harry Potter sequel and he's 60 and into cocaine for trying to murder Ron's kids  Uh, *The Cursed Child*, anyone?  &gt;Kids don't want to grow up to be luke anymore  No, they want to grow up to be Rey, Finn, and Poe. Same as kids watching the OT wanted to be Luke rather than the crusty old mentor who was getting too old for that shit. Luke isn't OT Luke, he's OT Obi-Wan.  &gt;Can we move the story forward FFS  Hence getting the legacy characters out of the way to *actually* move the story forward onto the new generation, as it's supposed to be.
&gt; non-macro background persons have said those things, but I‚Äôve never heard a macro person NOT say that.  I'll be totally honest, I'm a pretty big craft beer nerd, but I've had WAY more bad beers from small craft breweries that should have legitimately been thrown out than those from macros (smaller sample size, to be sure, but the only poorly brewed beer that comes to mind is the infected Bourbon County variants that should never have made it out of the barrel warehouse).

You are forgetting the ionic magnesium and the other trace minerals.
There are quite a few microbreweries in Saskatoon right now.  Downtown, there is 9mile Legacy, 21st Street Brewery (lower level of Winston's pub), and Saskatoon Brewery (located behind Earl's pub).  On the north end of the city, there is Prairie Sun and High Key Brewery.  On the east end, there is The Thirsty Scholar and Paddock Wood (which only does bottle sales and growler fills).  The Woods alehouse also carries a number of beers from various breweries across Saskatchewan (including Paddock Wood, Nokomis, Black Bridge Brewery, and Rebellion).
What I‚Äôve been saying for months tbh, I get bored when the meta is stagnant and has a low skill gap. Right now, building is pretty much the only skill gap due to shotguns being fairly easy to use.

It's pretty easy to pick apart other people's sources and provide nothing of your own, huh? At least 3 of those sources are well respected publications and you haven't provided anything. You'd rather just poke holes because that's easier than actually making an argument.  What's the point of this for you, anyway? Are you just being a troll or do you really think the media is worth defending?

It took a bit more work to fix than just new cables. The power supply had bad electrolytic capacitors and wouldn't turn on. Replaced those and it looks good for what was probably a Black Friday non-4K 50" HDTV. The only thing I don't like are the tinny internal speakers.

Once again you pick out the one thing that you can use as an excuse not to do this. For reference, yes, I did grow up in a small Wisconsin town where people say hi, chat and are generally pleasant. I have also spent time in major cities and it was no big deal to say hi, how's it goin' or to ask for directions. I used to be like you where I would not interact with people because I thought it was inconvenient or I might bother them bit I had to learn to get over that. If I do bother someone the interaction is less than 30 seconds, they'll get over it.  Next, try going to places where people might expect someone to interact with them like a bar.  Since you seem to like a transactional approach just ask for the time.  "Hello, could you please tell me what time it is?" "I forgot my phone at work."  You could honestly be getting on the bus and say "hey" to the person you sit next to or across from. They my say "hey" back or give you that little head nod. A simple social interaction.  Because you NEVER see it happening doesn't mean it NEVER happens. There could be people sitting all around you willing to talk but not wanting to make the first move and that is where you have to step up and go for it. Like I said earlier, what is the worst that can happen? Seriously, what the fuck are you afraid of? They might not respond? Gasp! They moved to a different seat! Maybe they are having a bad day, you don't know, move on.

... With everything going on in this world sometimes I wish I did. "Ignorance is bliss." But ya, I think monogamous relationship (rarely) exist. My definition may just be different than others. But personally I believe people are so complexed and therefore needs and wants change over time. We are not the same person we were 5 years ago. Our lifestyle changes.  Therefore I cant see myself or others in a committed long-term relationship.  Thanks for your comment. 
Basically if it isn't obvoius why it is important to the story then the question becomes "Why did you add that detail?"   Usually there isn't a good answer for that.

Monster Hunter has the most beautiful graphics. I get a bit dazed as I explore the lands.   Been playing the first Kingdom Hearts. I'm a bit pissed at Shadow Sora in Neverland lol.  This game would be fantastic for Wii &amp; VR =3 
Hopefully Canadians remember this the next time a 9/11 happens or otherwise America asks us for help. As someone else who was in the CF at that time, I hope we never send people to die for America again. Called a national security threat after all we gave. It's almost unbelievable.

It won't flat out powercreep the 5A, it lacks the gun depression to do so. HEAT also gives a notable advantage at tier 10 due to the 85 degree ricochet angle (not to say 350 pen APCR means nothing), and its mobility is still arguably better. Slightly lower top speed and hp/t ratio, but significantly better terrain resistance stats and effective traverse.  430U isn't being powercrept either, it'll still likely have the armour advantage, and the mobility advantage is undeniable -- the medium tank effective traverse is what sets the 430U apart from other fast 'heavies'. Don't forget the camo, which is easy to get over 30% when stationary and like 25% when moving (iirc, don't have my client open) unlike every heavy ever.  It'll be strong, but I think it's about on par with the 5A and 430U. The only thing I would advocate nerfing for now, before it goes through the live server stages of testing, is the APCR pen and shell speed. 330-335 pen APCR with 1300 m/s or so would suffice, not 350 pen with 1800 m/s.

I made the following comment in a REEEEdacted thread about this a bit ago :  &gt;Looks like someone vandalized a Wikipedia article used as the basis for the Google info, probably to win a Reddit argument like was done with the Rasmussen Wikipedia article recently.

&gt;oh was that why Obama cut funding then?  The discussed event has nothing to do with Obama, the dolphin language "experiments" took place in the 1960's.  Additionally, under the Obama administration NASA's budget went from a nominal amount of 17.833 Billion USD in 2008 to 19.508 Billion USD in 2016, an increase of 9% (though less than the estimated loss of purchasing power due to an estimated inflation of 11.5% in that same time period).  &gt; NASA 50/50 Florida and Texas  NASA has a presence at locations in Alabama, Australia, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Mexico, Ohio, Spain, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.  With the majority of its personnel being located at the NASA headquarters in Washington D.C. and the following 10 field centers:   *  Ames (Research), located in Mountain View, California  * Armstrong (Flight Research), located in Edwards Air Force Base, California  * Glenn (Research), located in Brook Park, Ohio  * Goddard (Space Flight), located in Green Belt, Maryland  * JPL (Space Flight), managed by CalTech in Pasadena, California  * Johnson (Space), located in Houston, Texas   * Kennedy (Space), located in Merritt Island, Florida  * Langley (Research), located in Hampton, Virginia  * Marshall (Space Flight), located in Huntsville, Alabama  * Stennis (Space), located in Hancock County, Mississippi  Though the largest individual NASA facility is the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, the majority of NASA employees are in California distributed amongst the 3 field centers and multiple associated research and development facilities.  
You can still buy them together it is just less common. 10-15 years ago, tablets and smartphones weren't really a big thing yet, so every casual user had to get a desktop. Because of that, they made easy everything included plug-and-play machines to appeal to those that just wanted to browse the internet and check emails. Nowadays, those causal users have moved on to the smartphones and tablets and sometimes even laptops while those who want a larger, more powerful machine tend to get the components that they want out of it and put it together themselves. When some components go obsolete, they replace them with better ones or, eventually, replace an entire tower and just reuse the monitor that had been using.

You might as well buy some Ginsu knives.  Seriously though, a hone will prolong the shit out of your knife and knife edge. Without a hone, you‚Äôll need to sharpen the knife far more often than necessary if you had been honing it. You also run a greater risk of chipping the edge as it will tend to roll over and then the greater force you need to use will compound the problem.

Red X is generally an indication of a power issue. Is it a red X with a 3 or infinity loop it‚Äôs a different thing. Move the power source to the the dvr off any power strip or surge protector and plug it straight into the outlet. I imagine you‚Äôre using an HDMI connection to the TV, try using a different port on the TV or component connection instead. HDMI ports on a lot of TVs back feed static voltage that the set top box is sensitive to. The component cable will give you the same quality HD as the hdmi. But you‚Äôre right the pass through should have no impact on the dvr as far as a red X. I could see it being an issue if the picture on the dvr started to freeze and pixilate because of a bandwidth issues but not a red X.

Its just a new gametype.   MOBA's didnt destroy creativity, and neither did crafting/survival games. FPS games didnt kill creativity either (although FPS creativity/diversity WAS pretty stagnant until BR modes shook things up).  Its just a new (and therefore novel) gametype thats just recently caught on, and is getting a lot of hype, clones, and variations BECAUSE its something new and quality. The excitement will wear off over time, and BR will become its own established subgenre of shooters. Just because its huge now, as a newly popular genre, doesnt mean people or the industry will drop everything else forever. Its just the hot new flavor of the week.

You cannot deny Love's contribution to the team, his rebounding and his soft touch with three-pointers.

Yeah it's awesome its not for everyone though, it's like the old fallout games   Kinda like xcom but an rpg with a story and choices and stuff It's kinda slow to start but really good if you get into it May as well try it out And don't worry about your gunshots missing at first, that happens until you level up a bit, confused me at first My best advice is to just go in blind, don't worry about googling stats or builds beforehand, just take a run at it and see how it goes you'll figure it out really quickly and things go terribly you'll know what's up for your second run

A therapist is nice because its a nonjudgemental voice who you don't see outside of your sessions, mine didn't judge me for how I would handle my stress and never made me feel bad about myself, they just want to get to the bottom of why you're feeling that way and help.

1) Winning the American War of Independence - birth of the country  2) Louisiana Purchase - shaped the country and ensured we wouldn‚Äôt have to cross a n international border to get to California.   3) Union winning the American Civil War - Kept the country intact  4) Allied victory in WWII -  Our being pole vaulted above the Brits as leaders of the West at the end of WWII allowed for Pax Americana and US cultural dominance  5) 9/11 - Drastically reshaped American foreign and domestic policy as we entered the 21st Century. Still effecting decisions today (Patriot Act, spying, immigration, expansion of GWOT, etc)
Depends on you but Sharon is a must hero especially if youre a beginner, She can clear \(nearly\) all stages and modes in the game. Having her early will help you progress a lot on the game much faster w/ ease. but if u already invested some money in that account. Try to acquire her as soon as possible if u can. It will really help u a lot. \(Though i didn't get here early, i still manage to acquire t2 chars but i did struggle till now which slow down my progression on the entire game.\)
Yes, some folk just have no mute button. Depending on the person and how you want them to react to you "..and your tongue is sharp." "Yes, it's good isn't it." Leaving them confused and you knowing your body is working and shedding heat well.

Dude I like Trump's policies I don't know what you want me to say. Not only do I like his policies but I just like my life a lot better with him as president I feel better. More smiles and more laughs with my family. I feel better knowing we have a president that puts America first.

Debt as in loans for business and mortgages would still be measured in fiat.   If and when bitcoin gains a sizeable adoption size, where it is practically ubiquitous, fiat will still exist. But it won‚Äôt have such a sizeable control over the levers of the economy. After all, in the US alone, it‚Äôs trillions in debt is measured in dollars. For the government to pay its debts, dollars must still exist. And from the looks of that debt level, it‚Äôs going to be doing so for quite some time.   So back to the lending argument. Loans could be made in bitcoin, but priced in dollars. For example, let‚Äôs say I get a $100k mortgage loan. But let‚Äôs also say that in that time, 1 BTC = $100k. So the bank lends me 1 BTC....but the size of the loan at date and time it is written and signed for is fixed at $100k... plus any interest.   If 30 years from that point 1 BTC appreciates in value to $200k = 1 BTC.... well that works for me and I can pay the $100k loan back and sti have some satoshis left over.  If the opposite happens and 1btc falls to $50k.... then I owe 2 BTC to pay for the original $100k loan.   Fiat will still exist and will serve as perhaps a fixed point of accounting for debt/loans at the time they were made.

I have found the behavior of various Choni fans unpleasant myself, and the fact that some of them ship Madelaine (who seems to have a boyfriend) with Vanessa takes 'real life shipping' to a brand new level of offensive.

**Review: #16**  This is a sample of 18 yr. rum from Nicaragua,. bottled by Hunter Laing‚Äôs Kill Devil label at 60.2% ABV. I‚Äôve been a fan of both the Golden Devil and Kill Devil series in the past.  ---  **Kill Devil ‚Äì Nicaragua ‚Äì 18 yr. ‚Äì 60.2%**  **Nose:** Big oak. Wet tobacco. Spray paint. That‚Äôs about it, but they‚Äôre all extremely clear and rich notes.  **Palate:** Raisins. Citrus. Massive oak. Chewing tobacco.   **Finish:** Under ripe banana. Cinnamon. Barrel char. Faint charred vegetal note.  **Strengths:** It‚Äôs complex and full of character.  **Rough Spots:** This one can get hot and sharp here and there.  **Grade: B/B+**  **Final Thoughts:** Another really interesting pour from Douglas Laing. This and the Bellevue had me considering grabbing backup bottles. Both were a good value for their age and specs, but they also both left me believing I hadn‚Äôt yet tasted what the distilleries were capable of.  ---  **GRADING:**  **A:** Truly memorable for all the right reasons. Pours I‚Äôm gonna be craving later. I‚Äôd buy a backup at the right price.  **B+:** Hits all the right notes with one or two exceptional ones. Just missing the crave worthy component.   **B:** Quality standard pour if priced accordingly.  **C:** Less interested. Minor flaws that start to diminish enjoyment. Situational purchase, but unlikely I‚Äôd buy a full bottle.  **D:** Major flaws. Won‚Äôt be repurchasing in any format ‚Äì single glass or bottle.  **F:** No desire to keep drinking except to confirm it‚Äôs really as bad as I thought.

&gt;  It's finite though, plus there are a limited number of motes for sale per boss, and they compete directly with the new abilities.  Isn't is 100 of each mote type per Torment? That's *technically* finite but more than the number of rubies available even if you can sub 30 all three (480), even before considering buying the ability records or job motes.  More accurate to say the rubies are finite (and a total bitch to get), though. In JP you could get 1200 of each mote so far, but the rubies are the issue.

Get the sharpie \- size large, your stones, a towel you can throw away and some acetone or nail polish remover.  Paint the whole blade with the sharpie.  Let dry a few min.  Then commence some sharpening.  After a min and a few strokes you should be able to see zactly where you are putting the blade to the stone.  Adjust as necc to work the edge and just behind the edge.  Refresh the sharpie if necc. Work till you have a burr then flip the knife over.  Refresh the sharpie as necc and repeat on other side.  As noted, Jon covers this in one of his utubers.  And better than I did.

[I...don't](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/17.png#sprite) want to have to do this. Kazuichi and Gundham...they may have been unreliable at times, but I would never wish...  [...I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/10.png#sprite) guess it's too late for that. I'm not that smart, so I don't know if I'll be of any help, but I'll try my best. Everything started that morning, at 8:00 AM. We were discussing Monokuma's presentation over breakfast when he showed up, giving us those shrink-wrapped books with information on the supplies.  [I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/09.png#sprite) think it was...Kiyotaka who was trying to get us all to split up an investigation. I didn't think I'd be of much help though, and Hiyoko wanted to hang out on the 1st island beach, so I offered to come around later to check on everyone and take photos if needed.  [I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/12.png#sprite) went to the beach with Hiyoko at around 8:15 AM, and she showed me a new dance! It looked so graceful and beautiful, I just had to take pictures!  [In](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/14.png#sprite) fact, it helped me...take my mind off of things for a while. Thank you, Hiyoko. Really.  [I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/00.png#sprite) departed at 9:00 AM, and got to snapping pictures at each location, just in case. I think that took about...15 minutes or so. I met with Kiyotaka, Rantaro, and Maki at the restaurant afterwards to discuss the supplies.  [After](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/10.png#sprite) the meeting, Maki asked me to come with her to investigate the hospital. I accepted, and we arrived there at around 9:30 AM. Unfortunately, I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.  [We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/04.png#sprite) were about to leave at 10:40 AM, but then, out of the blue, Maki dashed out of the hospital! Of course I was curious, and so I followed her to Electric Avenue, where I discovered she was guarding the store from Kokichi.  [Jeez,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/11.png#sprite) you always have to be trouble, don't you, Kokichi? When are you going to man up and stop acting like a child?  [Anyway,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/02.png#sprite) I decided to stick around because of that meddling menace, but after a half-hour, Maki said she could handle it, so I left.  [I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/09.png#sprite) figured that'd be as good a time as any to develop my photos, so I headed to the printer over at Rocketpunch Market at 11:15 AM. I figured having a physical copy would be better, anyway. Once that was done, I dropped them off at my cottage and came to lunch at around 11:50 AM. The only people absent were...Kazuichi, Angie, Korekiyo, Rantaro, Kaito, Himiko, and Keebo.  [There](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/01.png#sprite) better be a good reason for each of you not showing up. Especially you boys, and you better not lie, either!  [At](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/16.png#sprite) noon, Hiyoko was trying to get my attention, and I accidentally ended up dropping and breaking a glass as I was about to get a drink. You don't have to be so forceful, okay, Hiyoko?  [She](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/13.png#sprite) really wanted to go to the amusement park that day, so a bit later, we left and had a great day. We went on rides, ate some cotton candy, and all of the other good stuff. I'm so glad I got to spend that time with you today, Hiyoko.  [We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/06.png#sprite) started heading back at around 2:10 PM, but...that was when we heard it. Kazuichi's BDA, informing us of a body in the diner.  [We](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/07.png#sprite) were about to head over, but then we heard the explosion over at the 5th island! We rushed over there, and we happened to bump into Kokichi, so we told him about what we heard.  [But](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/18.png#sprite) then we headed into the weapon shed of the military base, a-and...  [...we](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/17.png#sprite) found Gundham's lifeless body, and the BDA played once again.  [During](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/06.png#sprite) the investigation, I figured I could use my camera for pictures to figure out if anything was taken. But the weapons were so scattered, so I'm not sure if even that will do any good, and I didn't have time to check either set of photos...  [I](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/09.png#sprite) wanted to investigate the other places, but I didn't want to just leave the body. Luckily, Kaito showed up, so I asked him to stay while I went around to the pharmacy, where I ran into Kaede, Ibuki, and Keebo, and to Electric Avenue, where I ran into Himiko, Angie, and Kiyotaka.  [Also,](https://abimon.org/dr/busts/mahiru/10.png#sprite) I should mention that I lost my purple cleaning rag for my camera. I could have sworn I had it at around lunchtime, but...oh well. That's all I've got.

Thanks for the good info! Definitely sounds awesome to not shave certain areas long term.
I didn't say it was a bad system. We've had our success with it, it just isn't a system that runs as many "safe" throws as other teams tend to do.  And saying Cam can't do pre-snap reads or quick passes is ridiculous. Do you even watch any Panthers games or are you just going off of a stat sheet?

You can get 2 each in isz and lower loran.  Running to lecture building is the best option for getting 2 easily.  Lower loran is a bit more difficult than isz.  Best option : Get 2 from lecture building and see if you can buy 2 more for 5 insight each. Else get 2 more from isz or lower loran.

You are the same as me. A girl I was seeing always wanted me to text her when I got home after seeing her as well as the ones you mentioned and I always hated it. It was new to me, and I only had one relationship prior where we didn't do this just because we'd normally start texting anyway when I got home, but to me it just felt so invasive.   I think it really is a personal preference. For me it always feels like they don't care how my day was but they're just doing it because it's etiquette to ask, yet almost everyone I meet does this as normal. In a relationship it's fine but when you've just met someone and things are just starting, that separation is key. I don't want someone watching over my shoulder when they've only just entered my life. 
We're 100% salt
It's pretty obvious Pearl is the opposite. She may *ACT* like it, but when she says lines like "I'm just a Pearl i can't do anything by myself" and "I just wanted to fuse as Sardonyx to feel powerful for once" it's hard to miss. Pearl is a walking talking mass of insecurities and false bravado.

I think we might be in for two different main radio stations. I imagine the Vault Radio will fill the seat of the typical 50s-swing jukebox that we've had in all the other games. However, I'm also inclined to believe that we'll probably get a more country, southern oriented channel, probably run by some hillbilly outside of the Vault.

The negative experiences causing an emotional reaction that results in irrational overgeneralization.   Also you are making the assumption that your experience will be the same for their son, and talking about it as if it was factual.   Normally, this would be fine as it only affects you, except you are spreading misinformation and potentially causing people to not seek proper treatment. Your description of these drugs is not how these medications work and is not their 'primary' function at all.  
Dang you're almost there! :) halfway man you got this!

Oh wow, what an utterly gross and shameless thing to say to someone as your reason for dumping them. Makes her look so bad. She doesn‚Äôt seem too concerned about exposing herself to be a parasite. I would almost feel obligated to send it to future bfs as a warning. Don‚Äôt take this personally people get dumped for all different reasons all the time. it‚Äôs not that common to find the right person and if it was it wouldn‚Äôt be special. Shitty relationships with shitty people gotta end somehow right ?
This story about your friend sounds like complete bullshit.   If this actually happened, why was your friend repeatedly going human in order to get invaded in one of the most frustrating areas in the game? This doesn't sound like a Dark Souls issue it sounds like an issue in your friend's decision making and that the game wasn't for them anyway.

Not really bothered by any agenda political or otherwise, star wars always had an anti-authoritarian theme with the heroes and maybe not so much in the films but the EU had destroying/reforming the Empire's anti-alien sentiment. As a previous poster said Star Wars has been pretty good for racial/gender diversity without obviously trying to make a point.  I just despair with the direction they took the universe post ROTJ any political agendas are meaningless to me compared to the overall story and character directions.

1. Cimetidine can be used for warts. 2. If you ask Google Home "What medication for GERD can also be used for warts?" it answers correctly with "Cimetidine..."  Maybe this is common knowledge but felt stupid when I suggested switching to ranitidine \(profit loss on cimetidine\) and MD said they were treating warts.

Mine was the database. Forgot to set up the username for the database. 
Okay as much as everyone loves to ask for this and thinks it would be cool, it is not...  Okay so let me explain, as a bot dev, why this is annoying to deal with.  When a person joins (talking from discord.js library btw), an event is fired off that tells the bot someone joined. The ONLY thing this event has is the member that joined, nothing more. So, in order to track invites like you want to, the bot has to, on loading up or joining your server, fetch ALL the invites, get their usage amounts, then, in your case, assign them to certain user IDs counts, etc etc. Then when someone joins your server the bot must once again fetch all the server invites from your server and then check them against its stored values to see if any of them changed.  This might not be too bad on a small server, but if you want to give out levels based on advertisement, which i highly do not recommend because it can land you in hot water, you are going to have at least 20 or 30 of these things floating around which is 30 invites that the bot dev must store, and then compare off of which is not so much hard as it is a major hassle.  I hope this explains why this thing does not exist on any prominent bots yet. Maybe when discord gives us bot devs and the api library devs the invite a person used to join then we can see more of this stuff working out.  P.S. Because of the nature of promises and api and bla bla bla, sometimes you can get a false positive, eg two people join from different links at around the same time and they both get assigned to the invite the last person joined with, which is another issue.
It really wouldn't... my response included temperature, miles driven, speed, the specific charging station used, charging rate, battery SoC. These are the things I'm asking you to share as well to explain a story that purports #RapidGate goes even beyond what anyone else has ever experienced. You're making an extraordinary claim, when there are other more likely explanations for not achieving 50 kW charging rates, and no details  to rule those explanations out with.
"You get free advertisement for this? Whoops, let us join a bit late, check us out we're a cool team too" unfortunate how the late replies don't sound as honest fan service. Not necessarily calling them out but was it not urgent email in a pile of emails or is it just deciding it's actually worth it to reply after ignoring at first?

In that case, I'd advise you to just kill them. Pokemon aren't worth the time to train especially when you can just get higher level Pokes with the better cooking pots and reroll their skills. Unless its a rare Pokemon and you're dealing with dupes. If thats the case, i'd recommend keeping the one with 2 skills, with one skill having 2 upgrade slots. The skills themselves don't matter as you can reroll them later anyways.

I also feel pretty awkward when casual friends or co-workers comment on my weight loss. Thankfully it‚Äôs all been lighthearted and supportive comments from the pleasant people I‚Äôm lucky enough to be surrounded by. But I also pull the quick conversation change.   When someone comments that I‚Äôve lost weight, I say ‚Äúthanks, I‚Äôve been working at it. Any plans for the weekend?‚Äù or something like that. I like to let people know that it‚Äôs not a result of illness (which is why I‚Äôm careful to rarely comment when I see someone has list weight); I am intentionally trying to lose. But also that I don‚Äôt want to talk about details, though I‚Äôm happy to chat about something else.

The Oladipo trade shows what happens when you trade 'assets' for a star player. Now, LBJ is far better than Paul George, but our assets collectively are/at least perceived better than Oladipo/Sabonis at the time.  Same thing for a Kawhi trade, we can be patient and still improve the team and strike in 2019.

They‚Äôre trying really hard to stay around DC.  FO3 is literally in DC Boston isn‚Äôt super far from DC, Boston is also a big American political history epicenter. FO76 is in West Virginia(part of which is very close to DC)/ Virginia(A state with TONS of political history, also DC to the north). And according to lore Vault 76 was considered a DC area vault.   I imagine if we ever get FO in New York it will probably not be NYC since it was totally destroyed. So probably upstate or end up as DLC for FO set in Jersey.   I could see FO 5 being in Philadelphia, but since there is already the Pitt DLC (Pittsburgh) I don‚Äôt know that they would go back for a full game in PA.   I‚Äôd like to see FO set in south eastern Virginia. Massive military presence in the area. Tons of Gov. type stuff around here. Also Louisiana would be sweet but if they continue choosing political/ big government areas it‚Äôll never happen.
If 609k households tuned in on cable to watch the episode, the number of downloaders has to be in the *millions* I am sure. The way this show is distributed there are fans all over the world who have the choice of either waiting a year to watch a show they are passionate fans of, or downloading the show illegally. Cable is not quite dead but I assume its going to reach a well deserved death in a few years, so its a lousy distribution method. I doubt there is any way to really estimate how many are pirating it though.

Yeah in my story I'm working on, the dragons are like... the most magical powerful beings. (Like d&amp;d scale ultimate boss... just crazy hard, so you gotta respect them). But the younger ones, like in the art I posted to the other guy, they are... not that smart. After a lot of years of dealing with youngster energy and instinct, they eventually get more docile and able to use magic than just fire, which includes telepathy so they can speak with humans, and even disguising themselves by transforming magic.  In the story I have, the main evil person is like... from this long line of royal dragon slayers, and she decides to change the path of how the kings play by instead forcing the dragons to do what she wants by harsh training and tourture when they're really young.  So... :/ ... I'm like, if she does this, she probably wouldn't be able to talk to them, but communicate like how you would with a horse where you'd hit/poke it a certain way to control and move it. Cuz she'd keep them dumb and not to mention the younger ones don't have enough capacity to think about language. Does this make sense?

Living in New Orleans where the roads are horrible and we flood from time to time, I really do factor vehicle height into my next car purchase.  It‚Äôs not that I want to go tooling around on a flooded street, it‚Äôs just that a few extra inches of ground clearance could save my car from being flooded if I get stuck in a low area during a sudden storm.  I‚Äôm cautious so it hasn‚Äôt been an issue yet in my low, sporty car, but I‚Äôd totally get a wrangler or Subaru outback or something for my next car.  If they still made cool small pickups with tiny cabs I‚Äôd consider that but pickups are crazy huge these days.
here's the problem - benzo's are actually too good at what they are designed to do. they don't just mitigate anxiety, they completely fucking remove it from existence.... until, it starts wearing off, and your brain can't help but desire that sensation of being completely care-free, which can't otherwise be created. And so you're left with a choice, live with anxiety, or take the bar, and of course, we'll always want to take the bar.  here's where you are now: you can't function without it, because the anxiety is so overwhelming the thought of going day after day in the agonising state of fear and fireworks in your brain makes you shudder.   here's the problem: the only way to end the addiction is to wean off the benzo's slowly (typically using valium) and endure an extended state of anxiety until you are completely benzo free. And still, your anxiety will be present, but you will no longer be a slave to the xan, and similarly can be proud that you are managing your mental health and moving toward a more sustainable future.  benzo's work like floaties for kids learning to swim. You had been treading water for long enough you decided to put on floaties (inflatable armbands), so you could just float. It was so nice to just float, you left them on for too long that you forgot how to swim. You need to learn to swim again.
&gt;A nice policy for the deluded patriot that thinks America is great enough to solve problems single-handedly; not so good for everyone else who knows you need friends to get things done in the world.  That's the problem with nationalist rhetoric. We're the land of the free! America is the greatest country in the world!  People start to believe that shit and make decisions based on it.
No, but I'm a member of the gay community who doesn't buy into the hysteria. You're also kind of twisting what he said.   He said that sources have come to them now about Bruce, but if they had come to them during the first task force, they could have ended things a lot sooner.  With nobody giving them information, they had to end the task force. His entire point was that they didn't have any evidence connecting anything, so they had to disband the task force.   That's not "blaming the gay community".  That's saying the truth: the police did exactly what they should have with the information they had.  If they had more information, they could have stopped it sooner. His actual quote is  &gt; I've heard a lot of sources say certain things, and had those sources said those things when we had Project Houston, I think there is a very strong potential that the outcome could have been different.   He's talking about the specific sources, not the entire gay community.  
Hoping he has a very minor feature. Testing stinks.
Oof! I hope he recovers quickly, that sounds painful!   I can't imagine surgery involving a fractured hip bone allowing him to keep playing the tournament so quickly tbh, but who knows.   Edit: Also interesting considering they almost lost Mamedyarov at the start because of his dental problem. I guess the hosts are getting ample opportunity to show off their medical system to all the competitors. 
Thank you! This seem like a great pass-time for me! I also really appreciate how professionally run this whole operation seems. Thanks for the opportunity to do some good!
No, it wouldn't. Harmony heals at a rate of 30hp / s. Additionally, Brigitte deals 58.33 damage per second from her primary fire alone (one 35 damage swing every .6 seconds). So while harmony slows the rate brigitte can wear down a target with her primary fire to roughly half, it doesn't prevent her from killing them with it.

I wonder at what point rich people start moving their political parties into these areas.  It would be simply \- cheap housing and register them to vote when moving.  Especially if they're politically active.  It's only a matter of time.

I don't think the notoriety of the resurrected is the key factor here. Rather, it's that long dead corpses were reanimated and walked to the city. We have multiple accounts of relatively banal events in the gospels, yet no mention of this extraordinary occurrence.  If there is a "residual effect", whereby weird magical things tend to happen in the wake of other weird magical things, then that would have a pretty huge theological impact on the metaphysical reality of the universe.

Personally I put myself on here because I wanted to know the way I see myself is justified, and I am correct in disliking my appearance. Also to have outside perspective.

Just some ramblings from an idiot for you.  &gt;*"The path cannot be sought‚Äîthe important thing is just to stop the mind."*  In other words, no seeking, turning within. (Kensho). Realization on the spot of emptiness, the transience of things, non-duality.  To be in playful samadhi. (The "Unborn" of Bankei).  &gt;*"You need to search morning and night until you reach the point where the road of conception comes to an end, whereupon you‚Äôll suddenly spontaneously stop. After this stopping, the racing and seeking mind stops."*  Death (Samadhi).   The racing mind "catches up", if you will, and rests. Unification of mind and body. (Which transitions the thinking from intellectually-based, to intuitive-based, "non-dual" functionality, or actions free from binding "karma"). That's to do non-doing, I believe.  I rather enjoy this, I believe it applies:  &gt;Candragomin:  &gt;&gt;If I apply enthusiasm, excitation occurs, and if I dispense with it, depression arises. When it is so difficult to discover the appropriate level of engagement, what shall I do with my turbulent mind?  &gt;&gt;If I engage with effort, excitation occurs, and if I relax, depression arises. When it is so difficult to practice the middle way, what shall I do with my turbulent mind?

Yep, we have two of these. We feed a mix of two different kinds of food, and it's easier to keep them separate until feeding time. They work great, except for the fact that they changed how they interlock when stacked between the time we bought the first one and the second, so they don't actually lock together like they should. So if you need more than one, buy them at the same time.
Those two for sure, but blood's immortals are already using the slots of the best looking pieces from it...

Can you tell me where you've heard this? I am reading [this](https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/SPR/downloads/js38724_GN09_Change_to_personal_super_contributions_deductions.pdf) and it says that concessional contributions made in the way I have described in my previous post count toward your concessional contributions cap \($25,000\). This makes sense because you get a tax rebate from making these contributions. Logic would follow then that, when you receive a tax rebate, you have reduced your taxable income. Following that logic, your taxable income might be reduced below $90,000 and the medicare surcharge should not be payable.

Largely depends on the environment and time of year,  and if you have a fire as well. If you're in the forest with a bearable climate,  a simple lean to facing a fire will be fine.

Or,  if you're more interested in fun, look at pictures of a bunch of different shelters until you find one that looks interesting,  and learn to build that.

The main writers are Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day and David Hornsby. There are others that have come and gone, but the core writing staff has remained the same throughout the entire series, so the comedic style has remained consistent.  I don't see IASIP as some kind of politically minded comedy akin to south park. They don't need to be trying to educate their audience on why black face is stupid, because that bit relies on the audience already having that understanding in order to to be funny.  There's no pivotal moment where the characters realize what they're doing is wrong. In fact the characters basically never learn any lessons, so if anything you could argue that it's sending the message that you can do those things without repercussions, even though that also would be a stretch because at the end of the day it's just a comedy show.  I do see where you're coming from, but I don't think it's likely enough to be true.

Sharon Rogers is S-tier* not A-tier. My favorite part of Shadowlands is using her to solo both waves of floor 29 in under 15 seconds each! There's a reason everyone and their mom has her at T2.

The hope is that the feeling will come back in the coming months, but anything I don't have back by 6 months is likely permanent.   I'm only 9 days out, so I'm trying to be patient.

&gt;This thread's top-level comments should ONLY be proposed questions to submit for the AMA.  REEEEE NOT A QUESTION
I agree with you. I've known lesbians from conservative cultures who were married off to men at a young age and didn't get any say in the matter \- they didn't even have the option to not get married, let alone come out as a lesbian. Coming out, getting away from family etc. only happened once they were older and had the means/opportunity to do so. That's perhaps the most extreme example of compulsory heterosexuality in action, but it's in operation in other forms in our supposedly free and democratic societies. It's troubling to blame lesbians for their own oppression within patriarchy, I don't see how that's helpful.
2H is mostly used at end game, at your level you should definitely use whatever you like the best. There are some skills exclusive to each weapon type so try them out. Generally speaking however, 2H is preferred. At least in Magic and Melee.   There could be some debate for Dual Wield ranged, but again, these are things you don't need to be thinking about yet. Pick your favourite. Have fun!
&gt;I saw a video today suggesting that humans are not ‚Äúnatural meat eaters‚Äù. I understand his point, but my natural next question is what if we were?  Would vegans then be okay with consuming meat? You mean a species that must have meat or will suffer a real health condition?   If humans did, I dont see you could have veganism at all.  &gt;How do vegans feel about animals that are ‚Äúnatural meat eaters‚Äù?  Snakes and lions are supposed to eat meat.  That's not immoral or wrong.   &gt; &gt;I can only conclude that it is animal cruelty alone that is actually the issue. My question then would be, if animals were not treated cruelly, would vegans be okay with eating meat?  There's no way to obtain meat without causing animals suffering and death.  Unless you want to eat roadkill that you find?

Yeah, you find out about it in her FTEs. Seems she‚Äôs part of this super famous dancing family, and once her talent was apparent, she was taken away from her parents to be raised by her very strict grandmother. Hiyoko deeply misses her parents, especially her father, who she was very close to, and she believes is the only person who cared about her rather than her talent.  She grew up without a real family, and was bullied by the other dancers, who plagued her with pranks ranging from pins in her shoes to trying to drop stage lights on her. That‚Äôs why she gloms onto Mahiru so hard, as a surrogate mother/big sister. If Hajime gets close enough to her to get her to open up while setting appropriate boundaries, she bonds with him as a father figure.

That is an illogical and asinine premise.  Should men, falsely accusing a woman of rape, be charged as a sex offender?  Should someone who robs a bank be charged [using a gun as a weapon] with murder?  Law must be fair and just and hold true.  There already exist laws and penalties for libel, slander and making false reports. Sometimes it is best to remain quiet and thought of as a fool, than to open you mouth and remove all doubt.

Thanks! I appreciate all the thoughts. 
I have a 2013 v, when the engine kicks on, I can actually feel it slightly.   As for the brakes, I think that the car doesn't try to creep forward when the brakes are on , like a normal car would\- so the shudder may be the car starting to creep. Just a guess.   BTW, I'm jealous of the low miles! My v has 111K miles on it... but I absolutely had to have the storage capacity of the v, so my options were a bit limited. According to the previous owner, and the maintenance records, it's been 100&amp;#37; problem free up to this point. Hooray for Toyota quality.   One thing you should know as a new owner\- Toyota does not include transmission fluid changes in the maintenance schedule\- they claim it is a permanent lube. Many Prius owners agree that it actually should be changed. I think 60K is a good time. It's not too expensive, about $100 including parts and labor. I had mine changed out at 100k\-ish, the old stuff was murky\- you could not see through it, so I had the drain and fill done twice.

It's been going on for years and nobody cares.  It has been reported, the store management doesn't care so long as they get sales and while it was reported up the chain and they sent out signs forbidding it, it still happens.  Nothing is being stolen, everything is sold at retail, not at employee discount, so they really have nothing to complain about.

Any kind of stubborn person and a less stubborn person, by comparison, tends to work out less favorable because the less stubborn tends to be more dominated and unhappy while the stubborn partner tends to not even realize it. Innes and L'arachel are both stubborn and good-hearted, so I feel confident that a relationship of theirs would turn out quite well. 
would it be good for minerals?
