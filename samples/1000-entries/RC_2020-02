I think the issue is most people can't remember what position and movements that they did five minutes later. If you want to test this try and write down every movement that you and the other person did while rolling. Stopping slightly after a small sequence ends allows many people the ability to clearly see what move they did or didn't do. If you think this isn't helpful to you because you learn differently then try to explain as respectfully as possible why you want to wait till the end of rolling to hear those corrections.

There‚Äôs a difference between being in a bad relationship and being in an abusive one. Just pointing this out as I feel like ‚Äòemotionally abusive‚Äô is a strong, important and nuanced term which is now casually applied to any and all bad behaviour on someone‚Äôs part. Abuse has long-lasting negative impacts and causes long term emotional damage. You don‚Äôt ‚Äòget over it right away‚Äô.  Your ex sounds like jealous, paranoid and demanding. You‚Äôre totally within your rights to say to whoever that it didn‚Äôt work out because she was too difficult for you and you got tired of her drama.
It seems that half your evidence points to yes, while the other half points to nothing. That said, it surely can't be too difficult to fathom that they may be used interchangeably, even though one may potentially imply a slightly more severe degree of meanness.  As far as my own lingual patterns, I typically just use it to comically exaggerate disgust like, "that's just *nasty*!" and as such don't find any harsh meaning in the word as it has many uses.

Ok GTOfanboi.  Maximally exploitative plays are good because they tend to make us more money than GTO plays.  If you want to give somebody a GTO breakdown of their line and then discuss the exploitative implications of what they're doing separately then that's fine.  But don't tell people that doing something is incorrect when, in that specific scenario, it's actually a genius thing to do.  That's just ass backwards.

It's right in the  Wiki  definition too:  &gt; a term for people whose [gender identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) matches the [sex that they were assigned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_assignment) at birth. For example, someone who identifies as a woman and was assigned female at birth   so if you accept that you've just said that gender identity is a thing that exists and that someone can be a woman without being "assigned female at birth".... But they'll say it just means "not trans" and there's no reason gender critical people shouldn't like it... right?

No, the ‚Äúpinch‚Äù controls work fine, but not being able to skip or pause songs without using Siri is the issue for me.

&gt; I DO like the freeform nature of the digital medium, but I am also concerned that the meta won't get to be naturally settled and played through when it does turn out healthy, diverse, and fun.   They do say that they will bring balance patches every month, but that doesnt mean that they WILL change things even if they are not worth changing.   What I mean is, they won't be looking for the devil where there is none. If the Meta turns out to be in a good spot, changes will be minimal.
In the strict technical sense of 'knowingly not telling the truth' I lie pretty much nonstop.  Like that, for instance - I'm not *literally* sitting here insisting that vaccines cause autism and the earth is flat, but I do frequently express myself in terms of metaphor, hyperbole, and dramatic understatement.  Now, in the sense of 'saying things to obscure a truth' I regularly tell my kids that we have no ice cream because if they're aware of the existence of ice cream I will *not* hear the end of it.  We have ice cream pretty often, but we only 'have ice cream' when the kids have been especially well-behaved.

I mean the letters in the link are obviously not the link. Never Gonna Give You Up has a surprising number of ‚Äúw‚Äù‚Äôs in it It could have been an alternate version though.
From the article:  &gt; That use is not needed in a modern industrialized society, Parker said. If a person‚Äôs gut flora dies, they can usually repopulate it easily with germs they pick up from other people, he said. But before dense populations in modern times and during epidemics of cholera that affected a whole region, it wasn‚Äôt as easy to grow back that bacteria and the appendix came in handy.  Sounds like the appendix still isn‚Äôt really necessary in modern society, so no measurable long-term effect.

Hi welcome to be games

No, but are you gonna really do only once in a week?
I'm sorry you're going through all of that. Yeah, I thought my life was on the upward when I turned 30. Now at 32, it's a shitshow of health problems, work instability etc.

If the video is true, it sounds like a turn based Underlords game, except you put cards on the grid instead of heroes, and there is no RNG in determining who your guys will attack.
Did you play the game - thank you very much for a lovely game of fingering??
Mine is simply called "the beast" as I had so many troubles getting it going.  My husband and children are always asking "did you remember to feed the beast?".
A new guy at work once called me back to his team's office where I had just finished helping one of our colleagues and kinda rushed out.   I went back thinking he had a question but instead he drew a big smiley with orange highlighter on a piece of paper. He grinned and held it in front of my face and said "you should smile more."  I looked him dead in the eyes and told him  that "maybe there's a reason I'm not smiling" and left without another word.  He didn't speak to me like that again.   It was pretty satisfying to see his stupid grin drop.  ETA: in my blunt ways I also learned that a straight up and single "no" usually shuts people up in these situations.
Unfortunately I think your reality is a different one than the one we're currently in. This is going to get him massive turn out
Congratulations and best wishes to the two of you!

Is this thread just about the boxes???
You're probably right about that! Although I would have wished for the UK to give more criticism and try to change something before shouting LEAVE.  Yes, the EU is a bit overrated. The US have far more power even though they're just one (big) country. But I wouldn't support the vision that every country would stand on it's own again. We need the support and togetherness between the European states, otherwise we'd be nothing but a pile of arguing voices.
Thing is, i see it like what iron man sad to peter when peter tried saying he stood toe to toe with captain america. "Trust me, if cap wanted to lay you out he would have". Brock could have been way harder on Braun, he probably went harder than he needed considering its fucking brock Lesnar, but it really looks like brock pulls his shots enough to not really hurt him but still get the point across.
It‚Äôs OT
Fair point. No idea how many ads he has or what variety. But I agree most say 1-2 sentences about Trump, then pivot.

Unfortunately about half of those gun deaths are suicides, which are not a fair metric to capture when talking about violent crime. That's a mental health issue separate from firearms.  And then when you break down the gun violence/death stats, you see that the overwhelming majority are carried out with handguns, **not** rifles/shotguns. Yet all the anti-2A laws seem to target the "big scary black guns" and not the lion's share of gun deaths.  Disingenuous. It's **always** about keeping a population disarmed so they can't rise up.

Maintaining control of the intensity (especially during live performances) is an underrated skill IMO. It sounds as if the kit had a lot to do with the fatigue setting in. If you let the adrenaline take over, you'll gas out quickly on styles/songs you don't frequent as often.   Focus on economy of motion when practicing, it will reduce fatigue and make you a smoother player. Arranging the kit according to your specific body type is crucial as well.   Light stretching and being aware of how much energy you have left in the reserves is the key to keeping those arms in check. Only when you feel comfortable can you start to work on that marathon endurance.

My go to is ''I'm uncomfortable making fast decisions and like to take my time to analyze the situation in peace if its possible'' then I follow it up with something like ''It's something I want to get better at and already have.'' maybe give an example from my time at the army and the mentality there ''a bad decision is better than no decision''. Little bit jokingly of course

I watched it a few months ago, and like you was unimpressed.
The problem mostly is the risk/reward. Demon is high risk, high reward as it's strong, but not a guaranteed ally if it breaks free. If you can just summon a lawful good, humanoid loving silver dragon it's high reward, absolutely no risk. It's a big buff to the spell. If you limited it to unfriendly dragons like the chromatic dragons then it would be evil higher risk, higher reward than the demon probably.

The vote in the house was not partisan, it was about holding the president accountable for  bribery, abuse of power, contempt of congress and obstruction of justice.

That's true for most people. However, I do know some who prefer to use and are stronger with 2+3. I've heard a theory that for most people 3+4 is stronger because the line coming from those fingers through your hand to your elbow is way straighter than when doing 2+3, allowing for more work to be done on them
I didn‚Äôt disagree and say that he did want to deal with him. I said that pakistani players have mentioned that he and other koreans don‚Äôt play against akuma well. That‚Äôs all, nothing more.
Scrying is only for the Watcher?... Other than that, yes, the battles are deterministic enough.  I mean that I sometimes manage to get an overpowered build where everything synergizes smoothly and the game becomes very easy. It feels to me that the corresponding part in roguelikes (lucky equipment finds) does not have as strong effects. I perceive the luck to be in relic/card drops (of course it could be that I am not skilled enough, also I am currently on Ascension 17 so it probably matters less for A0).
Hope you find work again quickly mate.

Its usually escapes that tecnicality on acount of being a monarchy, with the queen holding all the crows, in her person. But believe, without that distinction, it would most certainly be a federal sistem. And given that the most famous other sistem with devolved regions on the same level is also another monarchy (Spain), you get the point. But ok, since the power derives from the central parliament, its unitary. But even in that situation, Scotland as legislative power on a level highly uncommon in most unitary states. So its not black and white situation.
Cry for America, for all is lost.   In third world countries, this is the time when the military coups happen. The courts have failed, the Legislature has failed, and the President is a out of control....

LOL I literally made that exact reference to my brother the other day, that building is essentially like remembering combinations in Mortal Kombat lol. I only recently learned how to build as it's always intimidated me, since I always come across people who build super fast, and I didn't see how it's possible to be that good, but then I learned that's it basically just remembering what build is equal to which button and I've gotten better.
Nice! Reminds me of a Khepri vs Zion fan art I saw once. I also like how you drew the fingers, I always have trouble with stuff like that.

&gt; And exactly when, did he do this.   In his retweeting of the statement "they're biologically men".   &gt; This is the most immediate ones, I could find. https://twitter.com/SSBMagi/status/1181032592486871040  Which is the one I referenced, complaining about twitch chat in general, not responding to an individual person or situation.   &gt; https://twitter.com/SSBMagi/status/1208376936206131200  Which is a meme tweet calling out no one...   https://twitter.com/SSBMagi/status/1203081040727871489  Which is her saying trans representation is important?   These aren't call out posts dude.

But there are often moonkin, which are a third class that benefits from Shadow and not Elements.

Hey Whitney, haven't seen you in a while.
I don't know how common these things are, maybe they're just not as fun to talk about as food, guns, and medical stuff.  Garbage bags, plastic bags of varying sizes, aluminum foil, plastic wrap, dish soap, disposable plates/utensils if it gets to the point of needing that level of convenience, I have excess plywood and 2x lumber from building projects that I can board up windows or build small enclosures outdoors with, empty sandbags (my property is all sand under the shallow topsoil), work gloves, spare generator parts, mouse traps.  I don't think I have any unique food items so far.
&gt; it feels like more of a first date or intro messages topic  Yep. I agree with you.   &amp;#x200B;  \&gt;  College refers to everything you listed!! From community college  (usually only two year degrees, much cheaper) to universities (usually 4  year undergrad programs so bachelors etc) but then also some  universities offer masters and doctorate programs, and some colleges  only offer masters and doctorates.   &amp;#x200B;  Ok. *That* makes a lot of sense. I am with you now!

Yeah if you're that new to Differin you probably shouldn't have a facial and definitely not extractions.

In the P settings of some of the joyor models there is a speed limit setting, some scooters can go faster than the default setting.

I saw it as a meta-reference to having to constantly rethink your own actions to avoid doing something that could be seen as suspicious on surveillance (like arguing with a bouncer about surveillance)  That also makes sense though
Omg I thought I could have haha
Thank you
ESH.  You and your boyfriend knew you were moving and didn't make the necessary plans to ensure that everything was moved.  How about hiring a truck?  Moving you was not your or his families' responsibility.  If you are pissed at him, get pissed at yourself too.

Yes. I also learned to never communicate that something may be her fault because her response would be to  get mad or cry and talk about what an awful mother she was.

&gt;The answer I use is that a binary is an overly rigid and incorrect model. Humans naturally fall into a biMODAL distribution.  What about all the female people who due to fertility and ability to ovulate are confirmed to 100% female and would fall on the female extreme of the distribution even in your bimodal distribution model of reproductive sex? Your answer here seems to justify all these women being discriminated against and seen as naturally nurturing and wanting to get pregnant just for having the biological capacity to get pregnant as your counterargument to why a female person shouldn't be portrayed as wanting to get pregnant seems to rely on her not being fully female your model/not having the capacity to get pregnant. It's better to distinguish between biology and personality to begin with, then people don't have to be portrayed as wanting to get pregnant just for being female/biologically able to.

Surgically implemented fraudulent adjustments enabled by blackbox voting may already have thrown a whole string of crucial toss-ups in the past two decades including WI MI PA in 2016 and the 2018 Texas and Florida Senate seats to the R candidate.

There are good vampires for sure, but even the honorable ones are constantly tempted by their hunger and usually have to seperate themselves from most of society. They're also the product of Molag Bal, one of the most violently hated deities in Tamriel and are seen as an affront to Arkay.
It would be nice if they could price them like 1967. I think they were around $5 a pair.
It's kind of a beta. After the new features are properly tested and polished they'll be pushed to your game as updates. You can so what the other commenter said to join that beta version, but if you just want to play the game and don't have a real interest in beta-testing then it's advised to just wait for the official updates as you'll likely run into bugs and possibly corrupt your save file.

&gt; Bullshit. Syncerror is already responsible for fucking up Quake 4.   Can you elaborate on this more? The way I understood is, that *he* was the one guy from id's side who actually made/patched the game to be Good. You know, after raven were done with the project leaving it in a very bad state at the 60fps stuff etc. That's atleast what I've read him say on some reddit discussion (not here at r/qc but before qc was even a thing on some ql/afps place).  Syncerror from id's side as official updates to q4 and from community side the q4max team. That what made q4 to be good after the disaster launch by raven.
Nah its just logic

I guess no one sees this as a problem?  You can just buy your championship.  Before someone says Toyota, just like Honda, their corporate culture was design by committee and other issues.  If you gave a billion to one of the midpack teams I'm sure they'd start off with a car capable of leading the mid pack and beginning to fight for podiums, as long as they had the proper teamwork.

I could vote for Romney or somebody of his type depending on the election year and priorities for the country (I didn't believe he had the right direction in mind in 2012, but could have been with him in other years). But this has irreparably harmed my opinion of the GOP.  I'm young enough that they're going to suffer from this reputational hit for quite a while, and it will be hard for me to support a presidential candidate knowing the rot that exists within the rest of the party.

It depends on how free your extra deck space is. Zombies don't tend to need a whole lot of extra deck monsters, and Vampire Sucker's by far their best Link-2, but really the only way to find out what works for your build specifically is to playtest the ratios.
Interesting interpretation.  I don't see it that way.  Guess some will feel it is unacceptable, then.  I assume they feel the same way about "bitch" then too because of the "misogynist attitudes" perpetuated.  Or maybe it is all a bit arbitrary. Hm.

Yes, it's playable and can be enjoyable. Especially if you don't get too discouraged early on. I'd recommend creating a jumper and try to start in a kingdom doing Lohar trial or Richard (or Alexander) wheel. If the later, maybe you get lucky and get a headstart on unlocking one of them.   Also, don't try and create your own alliance. Get hooked in with a powerful alliance. Take advantage of alliance gifts and any monument/first occupation rewards. They will be invaluable as FTP.

Oh please ya you posting this shit on r/politics is safeguarding our democracy. It‚Äôs just making a mountain out of a mole hill so that Bernie can be the victim as always and the campaign can get outraged about the system being rigged against him. The guy who refuses to even be a part of the party and left immediately after running for the party‚Äôs nomination yet somehow is using the party‚Äôs name yet again to try and win the presidency.   But poor guy a few randos talked about some bullshit that they even acknowledge has no chance of going anywhere and it‚Äôs a dash to the nearest journalist. It‚Äôs tiring having pussies running for the presidency that are constantly whining about how unfair everything is to them. Would be nice to have some people with personal pride that don‚Äôt rely on being a fucking victim 24/7 but populists gonna be populists.
That's because they don't want to stop being angry. Singing shit like that actually brings these people joy.
Let me know if you decide to give up on it. I have two 1400s, one is fully restored and working but still waiting for me to recap it.

Or if he was never meant to be gay and supposed to just be a boy that breaks social norms and wears dresses.  Even Darlene in Season 10 of Roseanne denied Mark was gay.

Today, oil and gas, last week petrochemicals, but mostly oil and gas. Ever heard of Buncefield? My day job it telling people how to prevent that from happening. Speaking my mind is my occupational hazard and a pre-requisite in functional safety. Maybe one day you too can stand in front of a judge as an expert witness and spend 30 minutes justifying the use of a single word in a 30 page procedure on behalf of a regulator who is taking someone who spilled 900 metric tonnes of cyclohexane onto the street and were lucky to not kill everyone in the building next door.   That day you may too appreciate the importance of language, it's logical use, and screwing around trying to prevent someone's feelings getting hurt for being called out for the stupid things they say. For that experience you can always get group therapy. Here on the internet, you're likely to meet a wide range of people and cupcake some of them speak their minds.

Went to school with Justin Bieber. My only memories of him were him trying to act tough and pick fights with kids 4 grades higher than him and making fun of disabled people on the city bus and getting kicked off the bus more than once
I went to the movies by myself this afternoon before I had to pick the kiddo up from school and it has great! It felt so good to be able to go see something I wanted to see on my own time and to just do this simple thing for myself. And the best part was I didn't even get any nostalgic feelings because we used to go to the movies all the time! That was what has kept me from going to see something by myself for the past 6 months

There is no precedent or constitutional framework for altering the results of an impeachment. That's not necessarily going to stop anyone who wants to from attempting to litigate that, and it's not necessarily going to stop the Supreme Court from deciding to hear the case and issue a ruling. Odds are that it won't happen in any meaningful way and even if someone does it's probably possible to keep it tied up in court until well past the end of what would be Trump's second term.   Realistically the Supreme Court is incredibly unlikely to risk their credibility on what is constitutionally at best uncharted waters, especially when the public reaction would probably be constitutional amendments dramatically limiting their power.  It should also be noted that there is neither precedent nor law nor anything in the Constitution requiring that the Senate do anything with witnesses. They're not even required to give the House enough time to make their case and be comfortable, the way it's written they could have said, "You have 10 minutes, go!"   Also it should be noted that at this point the Democrats are all but imploding. The obvious coming acquittal is going to galvanise Trump's campaign making him damn near a sure thing to get reelected, barring a major recession between now and Nov. The last thing that already weak appearing Democrats are going to want to do is appear to have lost the impeachment and be trying to appeal that to the Supreme Court.

I guess you have someone to call if you break both arms..
You don't need to decide. The camera is pretty clearly not an accurate representation of the officers POV. Otherwise, driving that cruiser would probably be incredibly difficult.  The justification comes in the fact that the officer claims he saw a handgun long before we see the body, and the kid actually had a handgun replica airsoft on him. If it was a cellphone or something else, or if the cop said he **appears** to have a handgun, which would show doubt from the officer, then maybe I'd agree. But it wasn't and he didn't.
Thanks
Sounds like mine. My aunt would go to the store for my mother and bring gatorade, soup, coloring books, and cards and i would spend the day on the sofa.  After i got older (around 10) i was stuck in bed. Not even allowed to read.  My kid got a lot of cuddles, affection, television, etc when he was little.  He's a teen now, so when he's sick he mostly reclines in dad's chair watching movies, reading, and sleeping.  ETA: when i got older my mother made me feel like it was a major inconvenience to even give me medicine. It always came with a long sigh.  I have never treated my kid like that. We will go get him stuff at 4 a.m. if needed.

I'm almost done by now and it's super, super good! wonderfully written and really engaging.
A valuation is simply an indication to the buyer as to whether they are getting value from your purchase. They can then decide if they want to change their offer and/or walk away from the purchase.  The seller has no obligation to consider a revised offer. Please note, however, that as soon as a revised offer is made that the original offer is now void - and the seller has every valid reason to reject the revised offer, too.  What is a valuation, anyway? Somebody's "professional" guess as to what the property is worth? Phooey. A property is worth whatever somebody is willing to pay. That's the only true valuation that exists. There's a reason why you have mortgagee auctions - and that's because the only way a bank knows how much a property truly was worth is to let people bid on it.  Property, however, is special from a legal point of view. Unlike almost every other kind of sale - a property sale can only be conducted via a written contract. Until you sign on the dotted line *everything* is mere talk and not legally enforceable. So let your buyers try and bully you into accepting less. Are you prepared to walk away? If so, tell them no, and hey, you can tell them the property is now ¬£500 more expensive if you want.  The fact is these cheeky buyers would not be offering a smidgen less if they didn't want the property, they'd have walked away or offered an outrageously low amount. They're just trying it on, and it is more likely you could successfully bully them into paying more - after all they've already shelled out for solicitors.

Heading out to Kenya for 10 days, then the UK for 4 days. Expecting 70F+ in Kenya with some cooler nights as I travel into the hills, and then 40F in the UK, so packing for a range of temperatures.  Pack is about half full with non-worn items, so some room if needed to store currently worn items. Measures around 17"x11"x7" roughly when packed. Total weight of unworn items is 7.5lb.  For reference we have the Evergoods CHZ22 (behold the cat hair on the bottom!), my packed Urban Flyer, and a Tom Bihn Synapse 19.  [https://photos.app.goo.gl/gWyAETj5H2YbkEHHA](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gWyAETj5H2YbkEHHA)  &amp;#x200B;  * [My myog Urban Flyer](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/eufda6/behold_the_urban_flyer/): Rolltop with rear zippered access to the main compartment.

The texture is great, no polyester feel here. Good to use as shorts, swimming trunks, pants, and even pajamas (if not already used outdoors).    * [Jacket, rain, Marmot Essence](https://www.marmot.com/essence-jacket-889169423321.html): Very light weight, pretty water resistant. Don't often use it, and could probably leave it out.    * [Towel, shemagh](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/topo-skull-shemagh/): First time using this as a towel. Usually use a linen towel.

Packs small.    * [Jacket, fleece, Arctyrx Delta LT](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/delta-lt-jacket): Jacket style for everyday wear. I like this a lot, very functional, looks good. * Bag, compression, full    * T-shirt, blend v-neck: Some cotton/poly blend from Gap or somewhere with a picture on the front.

This is the 'heaviest' of the bunch, and the most comfy to wear. I suspect they will dry slow. We shall see.    * [Underwear, Weldon, Mesh](https://mackweldon.com/products/airknitx-trunk?variant=30873543278705): Also comfy, similar to the Airism.

Hoping the Weldons can replace these.    * [Socks, Darn Tough](https://darntough.com/products/mens-ss18-vertex-no-show-tab-ultra-light-cushion?variant=854095560723): No cushion for quick dry, short, but long enough to wear comfortably. * Ziplock, sandwhich    * Cable, USB A to USB C, long    * Earphones    * AC Adapter, universal    * USB charger, 2-port    * Power bank, battery, 3350 mAh * Ziplock, sandwhich    * Clothes line    * Tissues, Puffs 10-Pack    * Meds, full * Toiletries bag, Eagle Creek    * Nail scissors    * Toothbrush: Cut down handle just for easier packing.    * Razor: Generic safety razor.

May use a scrubby-glove next time. * Ziplock, sandwhich    * Shampoo / shower gel: Body Works high concentrate stuff.  A pea size is all you need, so 3oz lasts forever.    * Sunscreen, Factor 30, 1fl    * Toothpaste * Self (does not count towards total) * Wallet: Home made minimalist wallet made from ripstop nylon. * Underwear, Wirarpa * Socks, merino, long * T-shirt, Uniqlo * Pants, jeans: Because I wear them everyday, and they just work. * [Shirt, linen, blue](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=427535092#pdp-page-content): Dries quick, can be layered over a t-shirt and worn open, or buttoned up, or work under the Covert sweater. * Phone, Pixel 2 * [Belt, black](https://tripleaughtdesign.com/shop/nexus-belt/): Probably won't use this one, but something similar. * [Jacket, fleece, Arctyrx Covert](https://arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/mens/covert-1-2-zip-neck): Great thin fleece sweater.

Well, in a way it sadly makes perfect sense. A lot of things make the EU. Say Schengen free movement. And the Euro as money. The UK was the only country to opt out of both (as in they did nit want either, not as in waiting for one). Some British call it splendid isolation. But for me it seems like they were never really a full part of the EU.

From what I understand, the song wasn't necessarily written *about* the lost gear, but the lyrical content was inspired by how depressed it made them.
The US trails its peers in doctors per capita, hospital beds per capita, ability to make a same or next day appointment with primary care doctor, and deaths from medically preventable causes. Also, you know, the fact people don't have to be afraid to go into the doctor because they might be hit with catastrophic bills so they're more likely to be diagnosed and less likely to spread the disease.   What are you on about?

Tank size, temp, parameters? In numbers please   How often are water changes?   Any tankmates?   Replace plastic plants with soft silk or live. Sand down all decor smooth inside and out. Put a prefilter sponge on the intake tube of the filter to keep his fins out. Make sure 2" gaps between decor so he can swim through without getting stuck.   Do frequent water changes and dose--&gt;[Seachem Stressguard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002APILY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_PoVlEbSSAH4DS) (antiseptic, helps reduce stress and heals fins/slime coat) and/or [Indian Almond Leaves](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HG1TMIW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_7oVlEb9DZ3SV1) can be made into an extract to dose some in the tank with each water change (put 1 leaf in a clean or new jar, pour hot water in, cap it, then leave in fridge overnight to steep and cool). It has antibacterial/fungal benefits, reduces stress, mimics their natural environment. You can also do this with Rooibos tea, make sure it is organic and noncaffeinated (the only ingredient should be Rooibos tea) to be safe for your betta (you can float one bag in the tank for a few hours and let it mix with the water and release tannins, or steep it in a separate jar like the IALs).

&gt;I don‚Äôt know why they called these plans Freedom and unlimited  It used to be that 10^+ GB and/or $50 plans were (Big Gig) 'Unlimited', with anything less being 'Freedom', however with some of their current 'Freedom' plans that separation has been blurred, so now it's just nonsense marketing speak.

A pitbull one on one couldn't take a wolf or go toe to toe with one. The 3 livestock guardians I mention above have been know to take them down and have also been know to take pitbulls out. Pits only bite down with 235 psi and kangals bite down with 743. A german shepherd bites down with 238 psi and that is strong enough to crush a human bone. Look up kangals or any of the above mentioned. I've watched a non trained kangal take down a game fighting bully kuta (Pakistani mastiff) and kutas would easily take a pit down

NTA! As someone who is allergic to cats and also has two, she's WAY over exaggerating.   Fun fact, people who are allergic to cats aren't allergic to the smell or fur. It's enzymes in the saliva that they're allergic to. So as long as she's not coming into direct contact with the cat or it's drool, she's fine.  Saying she has to be on new medication just to be around you (even after you took precautions and changed) is utter bullshit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

 **-How did it feel when you found out you landed the role of Riko in Made in Abyss? Not only is she a main character in the show, but as you saw there are some intense scenes later.** It was really exciting. I knew the show had some really cool things in store, and I appreciate Riko's boundless enthusiasm and determination a lot. I got to play with a lot of levels and emotions as her, and I can't wait for more!  **- Had you seen Darling in the FranXX before you got the role of Ichigo? What did you think of the worldbuilding that went on during the first half of the show?** Franxx was a simuldub, so I saw episode 1 and 3 or 4 days later, I was in to record the show. I watched the show because I heard it had EVA parallels, and I enjoyed the world building a lot! I wish we had a few more episodes over all so we could have seen a bit more pay off for that build.  **- I saw in another question that you read manga. What series have you read in the past?** I read a lot of manga when I was younger, pretty much anything I could get my hands on at my local library! My favorites I read entirely would be Fullmetal Alchemist and Katekyo Hitman Reborn.

It doesn't have to be like a Crisis on Infinite Multiverses.  Just like a hand-off kind of thing  Star VS could have a gag where Rick and Morty are being chased in the background without anyone noticing. (Preferably, right after a line about how they can't travel between dimensions anymore.)  Then, Rick and Morty's episode has the pair chased by the monster of the week. They jump through Star VS, show the same clip, and then into Gravity Falls.  Portal gun breaks after Rick uses it to send the monster somewhere, and Rick has to use the portal Grunkle Stan built to get back to the Central Finite Curve.  Meanwhile, on Venture Brothers, the Order of the Triad ends up fighting Rick's Monster of the Week in a B-plot ending.

I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

An Interesting story from a friend who is a nutritionist.   The dairy industry had tons of whey as a byproduct from making other dairy products. They discover that bodybuilders have problems ingesting easily broken down proteins and start marketing whey protein to gym people. Even though a really fit person can only make use of 10-15 grams of protein after a workout when it‚Äôs absorbed quickly they start recommending scoops of 30-40grams, just for sales sake. Then they realize people are gaining weight and the bounce people are getting from the proteins isn‚Äôt that noticeable.   So they start to add testosterone to whey powder because the industry is unregulated and there isn‚Äôt FDA testing for ingredients. That becomes widely known in exercise physiology circles and then endurance athletes start using tainted supplements as a defence when they are caught doping with testosterone. However it‚Äôs widely known they usually use a patch for slow and steady absorption and to bypass the gut. Once taken to doping trials they enter used up empty cans of protein powder as exhibits to prove they were not taking stereos. There are residues of testosterone in left over dust that regularly show up in test labs that try to find which brands of whey are contaminated.   . However, some experts say that the busted athletes were likely taking huge amounts of Test in patch form form like what an old man takes. When they got busted they got clever and started adding testosterone to already empty cans of whey to manufacture an alibi.  They take these cans to labs and get results showing contamination and try to build an alibi. There are long lists of batches and manufacturers to avoid for these athletes so everyone knows which brands to buy in the first place.   Anyways. Food is fucked when you scratch the surface.

Well when only 3 side characters get spirits (Dorothea, Ingrid, Hilda) while the other spirits are all main characters (Seteth, Edelgard, Claude, Dimitri, Rhea, and Sothis), being one of those 3 side-character spirits is quite a feat, especially when the 3H cast is *huge*.  And again, when each house only got 3 representatives in the stage (BL- Dimitri, Dedue, Ingrid; BE- Edelgard, Dorothea, Petra; GD- Claude, Hilda, Lorens; Church- Rhea, Seteth, Flayn), being included in those representatives is quite a big deal.

I think sitting down and having a serious talk about this is the right move, because if you're really unsure about how you feel/what decision to make you will most definitely understand it clearly once you've laid it out on the table. If he truly is your best friend then he should respect whatever your decision you make and continue to be your friend whatever the outcome, ending your current relationship doesn't necessarily mean you can't be close friends anymore so you shouldn'tbe throwing anything away. In my personal experience some of my closest friends are women that I used to have strong feelings for that have caused rough patches but ultimately our friendship stood the test. I would say there's no harm in giving him a chance but you can't fake this stuff, if you're going to be with someone it's gotta be the real them, flaws and all, and if you can't see yourself with the person he is when you're relaxed and alone then it may do more harm than good. I'd happily tell you about my experience with my fiance but maybe not on public forum so hit me up with a message if you like?
He was in serious money trouble in the mid 90s. The burn scars had locked up his skin and joints and the VA was fucking him. He couldn't instruct or lecture anymore.   The very early internet got fired up and lots of guys sent him checks (paper, no gofundme/paypal action back then). I was in law school and didn't have much, but I skipped weekend drinking for a while and sent him what I could.   He sent everyone cards to thank us. His signature was what you would think an end of life burn victim's would be. It was a stand up thing for him to do

I mean, I'm not in favor of it, but I don't think it will be some massive catastrophe.  When Trump got elected in America, everyone said that the whole fucking world was gonna burn in a year.  It's been alright.  The economy is better, and he hasn't been able to achieve many of his social restrictions.  Political talking heads would be out of a job if they said "a'ight bruv, I know it's not optimal, and it's not what you wanted, but it'll probably all work out okay".  It's in their interest to make you think that the world is about to end cuz of the fucking conservatives.

Grew up in Waco my whole life and just moved to Dallas. I can tell you that no one there ever talks about the events of Waco. I'v only heard it mentioned a handful of times. Once was in my community college class, my professor knew David Koresh (referred to him as Vernon) first hand and talks about the attorney general (I'm assuming he means Janet Reno) like she was basically Hitler for how she went about the whole ordeal. Second, I knew a girl who considered herself a Branch Davidian, apparently. I hate the Chip and Joanna Gaines crap mainly because these people from all of the country come here and assume we care about them at all. They don't understand pretty much zero of us care about them and we don't care about the Waco siege. Just a bunch of rich boomers who watch too much television. They have no idea how small magnolia is and how "The Silos" used to just be nice, quaint silos before their operation came here. I'm assuming quite a bit of gentrification is bound to happen from it all. I mean if you go from Baylor and then drive one mile away it lowers about 3 socioeconomic levels. This town has so many nice things about it and I hate the the Gaines's move in and act like they discovered something. It's like bitch we've lived here all our lives and were just fine without you. You aren't saving anybody.

   Shink shank! Ha! I just shanked you, you'we dead kid! If you awe confused with what that means, it means I, withewman50, has shanked YOU, pewson weading this! Pwomptwy upon my shank entewing the uppew hawf of youw gut, youw intewnaw owgans ceased to function, thus swiftwy ending youw wife. Now, if you decide fow some uttewwy iwwogicaw weason that you awe NOT dead yet, then I wiww be fowced to not onwy shoot you diwectwy with the fiwst Death Staw's supewwasew cannon, awso known to simpwe mowtaws as the Death Staw cannon, and even simpwew mowtaws as just the Death Staw. Not onwy this, but I wiww take it to onwy the most uttewwy wogicaw concwusion, that if you did not die fwom my shank, you wiww most wikewy not die fwom the supewwasew shot, and thus I wiww use my immense ties with the fowce to bwing the Death Staw down upon you, not onwy cwushing you, but awso bwowing you up. If you fow some weason have not died due to youw fowcefiewd, then I wiww use my anti-fowcefiewd on you! No anti-anti fowcefiewds, as those awe faw beyond youw weach, and if you do say you use one then it wiww be fauwty as it is nowhewe NEAW obtainabwe fow a simpwe, smooth-bwained individuaw wike you.

You can use treated wood inside your home, they haven't used the really nasty chemicals in them for decades.  They say don't use treated wood where food can come into contact with it.  I'm assuming you don't eat on your mantle, lol.

Ah, I went back and looked. You're right. I skimmed over the post last night and missed that.   It probably sounded different than it read.
Sounds like your system is throttling.  Temperature? Power settings? Performance or quality?   Noise reduction?

Very nice!
&gt;What libertarian on earth supports a negative income tax?   Milton Friedman is a great example, as one of the most well known ones: https://youtu.be/xtpgkX588nM  &gt;They don‚Äôt support taxes at all  False, they're not anarchists.
No problem!
Doesn‚Äôt seem that way. It‚Äôs not like you are soured, you dismiss me as an unrepresentative crackpot.
It‚Äôs hard but just tell her that she‚Äôs become a dang to herself and others.  I can‚Äôt emphasize this part enough:  Have a plan ready to get her to where she needs to go - grocery store, dr.‚Äôs appointments, etc.  You can‚Äôt leave her with the thought that she is stranded and abandoned.  I had to do this with my Dad. It‚Äôs not fun, but it‚Äôs the right thing to do. He didn‚Äôt like it at first, but got used to it pretty fast, mainly due to him knowing we had a way to get where he needed to go.
I have mixed feelings on this. On some levels, I feel like it's a bit predatory to force people to shell out so much money for charging cables. Recently, the charging cable for my laptop broke, and my mother, who had almost an identical laptop to mine, couldn't share her charging cable with me because it was just slightly bigger.  On the other hand, forcing every charging cable to be the same could potentially limit innovation a lot depending on the exact articles and terms of this bill. For example, we have some electronic devices now that can be charged wirelessly, and there are plenty of legitimate innovations being made to charging cables that aren't just slightly changing the shape to be an asshole.  There's also the issue of which charging cable are they going to go with? Is one company going to make all these charging cables, or are companies going to get the schematic to make them themselves? Is someone going to get a royalty from all the charging cables sold? It has the potential to make technology a lot more expensive depending on if the owner of this charging cable design institutes the concept of forced scarcity/exclusivity.  I guess, ultimately, I would need to see the terms and conditions of the law before I'd agree or disagree with it. I'd be all for punishing companies like Apple for only slightly changing their chargers for the sake of making more money rather than the chargers genuinely being much faster. As I said though, I think this law could very easily be abused depending on how it's written. I hope that isn't the case, though.
I think im a cat too
Yup, sounds good. I'll PM.

Back to my original point, less sugar, less bad. Generally, the harder the cheese the better.   Meat and water is the ideal, but if you tolerate cheese, then OK. I've gone through periods of lots of cheese, and periods of no cheese.   It is easy for me to overdo.
Fuck power of the purse.  What ridiculous bullshit.  Cutting funding is the goal for conservatives and libertarian douchebags.  So wtf makes cutting their funding a problem?? What makes it pack a punch? Better idea.  Contempt of Congress, prison time and forfeiture of assets.
Alcohol:)
Congratulations to the whole family! I was adopted by someone who didn't share my DNA but has loved me far more than the one who did. You have a special man and you're all very lucky to have a loving household

Actually, it's quite shabby- since you can only liquidate your assets once.  That's not 140,000 per year.  That's once.
It was just a running joke

Good eye. Didn't notice that and even after the time it took me 3 times to notice him.
I had a few:  Ghouls N' Ghosts  Aladdin (it was SNES or Sega I can't remember)  Megaman X - I remember spending hours perfectly learning the bosses and the levels. The last boss always killed me. It did not matter how hard I tried he got me every. single. time.  Last but not least Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES). I haven't played it since I was a kid but I remember that game being unreasonably hard. The music from the game itself gives me anxiety.

Thanks I‚Äôve looked at FB already so tempted. What strike for March calls?
Vivziepop: announces Alastor and Angel Dust pushies.  Fans: Finaly we get own pushie!  Vivziepop: sorry they're already sold out.  Fans: **my disappointment is immeasure, and my life is ruined!**
Yeah now we can get back to our regularly scheduled Twitter shenanigans, self-manufactured crises and assorted hirings and firings.
Yeah I guess so haha.
I agree totally!!!
WHAT THE HELL!?
Yes, I want to know this too. They keep saying "it wasn't done correctly" but I don't understand what they mean
Is OP delusional because gift cards usually sell for a little less than their value? I dont buy gift cards from people so idk
Old oceanic crust is dense and sinks. Eventually they think the ocean floor will get so old that it will detach and start subducting under the east coast of the Americas.
Aww, thank you! And dude, I‚Äôd love to see your cosplay is you ever manage to get a green hoodie!
We‚Äôve all been blaming you.
You wanting to cut welfare programs when they barely provide enough care as it is shows a remarkable level of sociopathy.

Dead Space. The final area where you‚Äôre locked in the room with the red lights going off and tons and tons of aliens coming at you. I unknowingly went into this area with barely any ammo or health and there‚Äôs no resources to pick up in the area, and the only save I had was an auto save from right before I entered the room. Safe to say I tried about 80 times before just completely throwing in the towel.
Yeah first in last out. You're right. Jesus im getting comp sci flashbacks now lol
I rate Weller above Woodford, Turkey, Evan Williams, Old Granddad BIB, and I haven‚Äôt yet tried Elijah Craig.  It‚Äôs good stuff, but it‚Äôs easy to find things for $30-40 that are better... just not in the $20‚Äôs.
You can believe her and you better ask her out again.   You asked her the day of, and she had plans. This is extremely normal. But she is still interested so she let you know that by offering to go another time.   You don't have to psychoanalyze this. Just believe her and ask her out again, with a few days notice this time. If she has plans again, just ask her when might be a better time.
I like big games, and don't usually have a time limit playing at home, but yeah. When you're trying to get 3 or 4 games in a single day, 2k is a bit much.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need the world to see that I‚Äôve been the best I can be, but I don‚Äôt think I could stand to be where you don‚Äôt see me‚Äù I dunno why, probably because my girlfriend had dumped me a few days before but eh
Why does everyone sleep on Star Fighter Assault?
This sort of tiktok shaming sure seems to be popular. I mean, we all have a laugh about the awkward situation, but we have zero context and this could affect her life, so that sucks.
Oh so what you are saying is: demonstrate in a fight with the potential partner that you are superior in combat, causing them to fall madly in love with me
