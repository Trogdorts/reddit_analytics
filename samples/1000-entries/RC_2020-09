17 year olds roaming the streets with assault rifles and shooting people is definitely not the hallmark of a healthy society, though.

Same. I haven‚Äôt played in like a month, bar the occasional event and even then, I find myself just slowly losing interest. I‚Äôm nowhere near being done, but apart of me does think it‚Äôs due to the constant stream of sending trains out practically every other minute. This ‚Äòis why all of my trains haven‚Äôt been recently repaired so I get some form of reprieve. If  train journey trains mirrored actual times, I‚Äôd like that as it‚Äôd mean sending off a train or 3 daily.
We lived in Seattle and there were signs in the store and there was garbage in the flyer. Had some relatives in town and went in, walked out and never went back.  We used to buy their over-priced gift boxes as presents during Holidays.

I think the same is often true of their male/TRP equivalents. Except that in TRP the abuse they receive is often from all the women who *don't* want to be in a relationship with them.

I just want things to be called fairly. Bam doesn‚Äôt usually do things like this, but using your weight to push off of the defensive player is Giannis‚Äô bread and butter.   If that‚Äôs an offensive foul, and I agree that it is, then it should be called on both guys, and yet Giannis literally did the same thing in transition earlier in the game and  nothing. Superstar calls I guess.

&gt;Trump caused the disorder  Police brutality has been a problem for decades. The fact that it finally blew up while Trump happened to be president does not make it his fault. He does enough stupid and evil shit to blame him for without having to add every single thing that happens to occur during his term.  "Thanks Obama" is just as dumb the other way.

I would agree that the Democrats are repeating the behavior of the past, by sponsoring and instigating the riots in the streets and claiming that if elected times would be more peaceful. Biden recently said that if Trump was elected the violence would continue, which reinforces this.
Did you add verses to By Your Side or is it just the chorus and beat?
Story aside there a lot of stuff that makes BL2 shittier than the first one. What's front and center in my mind is the season pass DLC that didn't even cover all the DLC they put out for that game, RNG nerfed so you wouldn't get any gun that's good for more than a couple levels, and toned down violence and face melts. Is there a way to make this meme redundant and wake up again in BL1?

I (18M) have grown up with amused parents since I was 9 years old, my sister (23F) had many problems with social services and with my mother when she was young (14-15-16-17), my sister ran away from home, physically fought with my mother, drugged and dated assholes. Over the years she apparently matured, the problem is that she is still stupid in terms of personal relationships and she continues to treat me badly, she has been dating a boy for almost 5 years, they have fought very regularly since forever and the guy is not A very good example, he has never been violent with me and I don't know if he would have been violent with my sister, which doesn't matter to me either, the fact is that this guy is or was related to illegal activities, he doesn't have any studies or work. They currently live with me at my mother's house (my mother does not live with us, she lives with her boyfriend who is a great guy). My sister has always treated me badly with insults, belittling me and being condescending to me. She and her boyfriend had a fight today and theoretically they had left him, (but the uncle came to sleep at my house today too) so my mother told me that tomorrow we would put a camera in the hallway of the house in case he tried to enter to know it and call the police, this annoys me because the camera is controlled simply from the mobile and I do not think it is very useful. I am thinking of buying a lock for my room since I do not trust my sister or her boyfriend, (although he has never treated me badly and treats me better than my sister in most occasions, I always feel sorry for him and I hope that I left it with my sister) but I am afraid that my mother does not want me to put the lock on my room. By the way, my sister has cheated on this guy many times, I know because I have met a couple of his flirts. I sincerely hate my sister and it only causes me apathy. And I am also afraid that if one day she breaks up with this guy, she will have a relationship with someone worse.

If postponing until you can afford it isn't a possibility, it seems your only option is to try to explain your perspective to your parents and, if they still insist, including your sister in your wedding party.   Our thoughts are all kind of irrelevant here. If your parents are providing funds with a condition, the only choice is whether you want to accept that money with conditions or pay for the wedding without their help. If you need to downsize because you decide the terms of their funding isn't worth it, it might be cheaper to lose the deposits or you may be able to convert to cheaper packages.

I hope to one day make a Multiplayer Hack for one of my favorite NES games but I understand it will take a while (maybe years) to build up the skills if I can reach that level at all.

Which encylopedia is this? I have a great one calle the Tolkien Beastiary which is brilliant, but if you can get your head around it, I recommend the Silmarillion. Loved LOTR and read books as a kid before even films came out (sadly I'm nearly 40!) and loved the films too (but not the hobbit films. waste of space they are). Anyway, tried reading Silmarillion when I finished LOTR but could not get my head around it, wondered what it was all about. Later, got back into Tolkien in a big way and was actually teaching it a bit for my work and decided to give Silmarillion another spin. I read it twice back to back. It just makes LOTR seem common, the rest of Tolkiens mythology was Legendary (he called it his legendarium). Like Sauron just being a servant, that's no joke. Morgoth was utterly evil and messed everything up, but he was literally a god (Vallar) whereas Sauron is only a demi-god (Mair, like Balrogs and Gandalf).   Sorry to nerd-jack you all but I am trying to sell the Silmarillion as it's brilliant but not many people have read it

&gt; *Justice League* was not a flop it just disappointed considering how phenomenal BVS did.   BvS's box office was a massive disappointment. It barely broke even, and, despite featuring 3 of the most iconic superheroes of all time, failed to surpass the $1 billion mark.  And *Justice League* bombed. A $300 million film (not including marketing) that grosses just under $660 million is a bomb.

It was good! Better than I expected actually. Middle seats are still closed until at least October and everyone kept their masks on (that I saw anyways).   There are new rules for the masks though. Bandanas or anything that leaves an open space around the chin isn‚Äôt allowed. Wearing a face shield alone isn‚Äôt enough, you also need a mask. Masks must be worn over the nose. So, basic common sense. And the flight attendants were on top of it, very politely reminding people to pull their masks up. They have masks there for those that need them.   Overall I was very pleased with how they‚Äôre handling things.

It's common for entire houses to be tiled in tropical regions. I've seen this in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Costa Rica and FL.

I do notice that our tiled southern facing bathroom gets hot if the curtains are left open in the summer.
This is very old and a good memory to remember for the sake of remembering good memories to remember.
Well we know how to treat our players unlike BOB :)
My monster secret!!
Aerospace afaik would be pretty much entirely TIG; the FAA is very slow to allow new tech and it's harder to test or inspect the integrity of MIG welds than TIG welds. I'm actually not certified so I'm not sure but the job listing would probably say what certs they require - those would be specific AWS certifications for specific joint configurations. For food production they're very concerned with the surface finish so a weld test will often be required unless you're starting at a truly entry level apprentice position (I was lucky enough to land such a position when I first started although that's honestly rare). I assume the aerospace industry is similar with regard to the quality of your welds because if how critical they often are.
Just because a passenger befriends a denizen doesn't mean that they're romantically attracted to them, they're just a friend/guide helping them get off the train.
Thanks! I think they are hesitant to do the swap since they haven't done it before, but everything I'm reading online seems to point to the 2.5 being pretty straightforward other than some minor machining work. I'll do some more talking with  them!
The majority of that money goes to personnel.  That military surplus equipment they get is virtually free in comparison. It will easily cost a police department more to put a police officer in a MRAP on riot control duty for a day than the MRAP itself costs between the hazard pay and extreme amounts of overtime. They get them for a grand or so while hiring a police on riot duty is damn expensive + hazard pay  &gt;  Seriously they usually get between 1/3 and 1/4th of the entire city budget.  And what else should it be spent on?  Law enforcement is pretty much the one thing that needs to be done on a city to city basis

If you want extra real time protection, then you'll be replacing Defender. Kaspersky Security Cloud Free is probably the best free AV at the moment, with other good options being Avira, Sophos, or Bitdefender. Only use one of those, and whichever one you pick will automatically disable Defender for you.  If you just want to run an occasional scan to check that you're ok, but not have any additional protection as you browse, then the free version of Malwarebytes is always useful. Just decline or deactivate its premium trial.

My cousins lives in Athol and I visit them often. I lived in Orange for a year.   There is nothing to do out there, unless you like the outdoors...which isn't bad. I got into bike riding, so I would love to bike out in the Berkshires.   However, I love going to Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox games...but it's like 2 hours to drive out to Boston. I also like going to casinos, but a new one was opened in Springfield recently.   They finally got a decent shopping center with more stores and restaurants.   The hospital was updated. There's a state police barracks located in town. The local high school lost its accreditation a few years ago, but I believe it got it back.   Also, my cousin has to drive his trash and recycling to the city dump...there's no garbage trucks, which I find odd.  Personally, I couldn't live out there. I couldn't find a job with my background, it's too rural, and just out there. The residents of Athol can tell I'm not from around there.

People only know as well as they've been taught.   Our society is sick and either it will die and something else will pop up or it will heal.   I don't fundamentally think it can really heal though. The whole slave owner/slave dynamic is too deeply engrained in how society views itself. It's there in a corporate environment too. Just white people don't have to worry about the cops as much. *Yet.*

No problem. I think Maze is the classic you have to love yourself before anyone else is going to love you. She needs to get herself together and then she will be able to find what she is looking for. I do feel for her that she is sort of the off man out but sometimes you have to understand that your friends have other priorities and find a place for yourself ( yes she is working on this). Let's hope she finds what she is looking for and can just stop blaming others for her unhappiness. Everyone loves a redemption arc so if both the devil and a demon can be good gives hope to the rest of us poor saps hehe.

Personal opinion but I like Deadwood 1876 the best out of all the 4 "Dark Cities" games. I think the western theme elevates it a lot and the dice fighting is great. But Tortuga and Salem are both okay hidden role games but I think there are many better hidden-role games like Resistance (or Avalon), One Night Werewolf, Secret Hitler, Deception:Murder in Hong Kong and Saboteur to name a few.

That's really your opinion and taste, tho, at the end of the day. I have been a fan since early 2016, and ON is one of my favorite title tracks, and I loved it more than some of the "old" BTS songs. I could take or leave Dynamite, but ultimately it's only because it's not my type. BTS has been releasing all sorts of different genres of songs since the very beginning. It's disingenuous to say that they're only doing that now. Of course, it's your opinion that their songs are worse now and it's also your choice to no longer support them because of it. But the core BTS, I don't think they've changed.

Nobody is buying the police union's version "wholesale". This is the cops' version of events and it's therefore interesting to hear what they have to say. However, most, if not all, of their points are verifiable using the multiple videos, witnesses, police communication recordings, and Jacob Blake's own admission that he had a knife.   They would look foolish to print easily verifiable falsehood and would hurt their cause, which is why I lend some credence to this document.  This isn't the final say about what happened that day, it's just the cops' version. We'll have to wait for the trial and full investigation report for a more complete vision.

Yes. Actually I took 5 mg cd5-9 with no side effects and no follicle growth, and my doctor put me on 7.5 mg right away to see if that second burst would do any good. I just took my last dose of 7.5mg yesterday I'll be going back in a couple days for another ultrasound. I had a headache the first day, no side effects for a couple days, but yesterday I felt like crap. Nausea, fatigue, lightheadedness, anxiety. Not fun but hopefully that means it's doing something this time!
I edited to clarify.
One bullet at a time, and I‚Äôll still die with a clear conscience.  In an era that‚Äôs looking increasingly like the Weimar Republic of the 30s, I‚Äôm not going to be voting for more authoritarianism no matter which side, so continue to feed a system that will turn on you in the end.  People who actually believe in liberty are actually facing TWO merciless enemies and you want me to support one because ‚Äòit‚Äôs anonymous and easy‚Äô. That‚Äôs as morally bankrupt as both major parties.   Rs tell you Joe Biden is going to smash your balls with a hammer, Trump says he‚Äôll smash them, but a little gentler. So when libertarians suggest getting rid of the hammer, it‚Äôs all our fault. Your party is half the reason we‚Äôre here. Own it.

Happy birthday man!! I actually forget about people's birthdays all the time. I also think the celebration of a birthday can sometimes be blown out of proportion.   But I do like being wished happy birthday and doing something for it. Something similar to your story has happened to me. I decided that it's on me to plan my birthday and remind people.  We're all busy and if anyone is going to remember your birthday, it's you. So I'd say that you shouldn't overthink it, it's not "you" it's just people's shit memory and distractions and focuses on our own lives.   Next year, plan your own birthday and invite people and remind people! Doesn't have to be a negative thing or big deal ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Damn, I feel like your advice, which actually comes from a place of knowledge and experience is being overshadowed by all the advice that is coming from a place of pure emotion.  If this all actually happened and isn‚Äôt a fake story like a lot of the trending threads in this sub I really hope OP looks at your responses carefully and considers all the facts from a legal standpoint.

There has been one other report of being unable to get the website to honor the free shipping limit on this coupon a few months ago when the offer first came out. I recommend phoning the customer service agents and ask them to handle it for you. I have always found them quite accommodating as well as empowered with overrides when things don't go right.

The boxing wasn't/isn't the issue, he boxed as an amateur (like 27-3) as a teenager into his early 20s. All the heartthrob pics you see of him are from his acting career, *after* most of his boxing. He was only professional between 1991-1994, and zillions of pro fighters have longer careers without getting faces like Rourke's.   He looks the way he looks from hedonism and plastic surgery.

Wow you're an aggressive little pedantic, aren't you? Jesus. I looked on the DOT's official website and tried, but their website is not the easiest to navigate imo. All I could find was Q&amp;A, none of which was related. I'm also on mobile, so maybe their desktop version works better. Either way, I'm clearly not as bothered by this shit as you are. Don't patch sidewalls, it's dumb as fuck.  Edit: where I first heard it from was my teacher in college when I was studying to be a mechanic. His exact words were "it is illegal to patch a sidewall. Never patch a sidewall" and I took it as truth because why would he lie about that? Maybe it's not a law, I guess I can't say for certain as I gave up looking on the DOT's site. All I know *for certain* is that I will not do it and it's an absolutely terrible idea, and no one else should either.  Edit 2: there are no federal regulations on patching tires at all. However due to liability, the vast majority of shops will refuse to patch a sidewall. Which you should never do anyway. Either way, there's no need to be a fucking dick about clarifying what you said/asked.

This just happened this year nung June. I met this guy online, wala kaming label pero sobrang sweet namin sa isa‚Äôt-isa. Di kami FUBU/FWB. Since off kami parehas sa trabaho, nagdrive ako papunta sa apartment niya. Netflix and chill kami tapos umiinom rin kami ng Jack n Coke non. Nalasing ako as in siya din. Nanunuod pa kami nun ng Harry Potter sa projector niya sa kwarto haha! Tapos nag-cr lang ako sandali pagbalik ko hinubaran niya nako and he sucked my nipples real hard libog na libog siya dahil malaki tits ko tapos maliit nipples ko haha. We fucked so hard, first time kong maexperience yung anal fuck buti nalang meron siyang lube na nakatago lol. So naglagay siya ng madaming lube para swabe, sa una masakit pero grabe tagal naming nakadoggy sabay hinahatak niya buhok ko tapos bulong nang ‚Äúplay with your clit baby‚Äù shet!!! Lalo akong nalibugan. Tapos knocked out kami after 1hr, kinabukasan pag-uwi ko may dalawa na akong chikinini sa magkabilang boobs ko. Hahaha!
Ok well then it seems that I react differently to it than most people

Well it's a great deal right now for us but could bite us a season later.  The fact that there's no option/obligation to buy indicates that they're banking on either him playing regularly if Zizou leaves or sell him for a high price if his stock goes up.  It's pretty likely his stock will rise if he carries on with his form from the 2nd half of last season.

The purpose of a training log is to determine how your training affects performance. Log them as strenuous hikes. Conversions are weird. I'm a big hiker, and I don't hesitate to substitute hiking for running. Just because it's not running doesn't mean it won't make you stronger. I'm working on finishing the White Mountain (NH) 4000-footers. This past Friday I hiked almost 15 miles with 5000+ feet of elevation gain. Weekend before I hike about 18 with about 3000 feet of elevation gain. Hikes like this used to give me sore legs, despite all my running. Not anymore. I'm thinking that's a sign I'm getting stronger.

Eu acho essa mentalidade bem rid√≠cula, visto que \~55% (n√∫meros tirados do M.C, √≥bvio) das estrelas dos maiores torneios de l√° s√£o provenientes do futebol sul-americano.

I know right
The most exciting window - the one that heightened anticipation for the season to come - was probably 2007, when we signed Tevez, Hargreaves, Anderson and Nani.   I'd say the best window I can remember - in terms of its immediate impact - was 1998. We broke the English record transfer fee for Yorke and the world record fee for a defender in Stam. The January window where we got Evra and Vidic is a close second

&gt; Well, during the rise of the Third Reich the communists also rejected a coalition with centre left parties   And *this* is why I, one of the most left people I know, will likely be voting for Biden. The Green Party policies are right up my electoral politics alley and I believe in the whole notion of "earning a vote with policies" that the Democrats seem to take for granted. But this has happened in history already. And too many people are at greater risk under a Trump admin compared to a Biden admin (still, like 50 million people won't get health insurance, not to mention the climate).   &gt;seeing how they were enamoured with the notion of accelerationism.  This I did not know, but from what I've seen, this is starting to happen again. It makes me so uncomfortable but maybe I'm too much of an idealistic pacifist some days.

Oh goodie, Judith and her husband playing the victim card, AGAIN!  One of them behave like deranged children, it gets called out, then they wait for one comment from one shitty person and put all the emphasis on that.

But no, racism is okay as long as it‚Äôs happening to someone unrelated to Judith Collins.

Verizon charges top of the line prices for mediocre products. The products work fine for 90% of the customers. But for half the price you can get something brand new and twice as nice...better range more bandwidth better security more personalization options a better app more connectivity better network integration and better reliability. The downside of course is Verizon will be limited in tech support because they won't touch your service if the router isn't theirs. If they can ping your ont and it seems fine to them then the service issue is on you to figure it out on your own.   This is all moot if you have tv service as mentioned in other replies. With a somewhat confusing and expensive exception that limits your choices you are required to use the Verizon router. The best option in that case is to daisy chain the Verizon router to another $50 router. Put the tv on the Verizon router and everything else on the other one. This will actually give you better service and reliability.   If you decide to by a cable modem you will be wasting your money...it will have the same effect as trying to plug an ethernet cable into an hdmi port and wondering why you aren't getting picture or sound.  Also don't buy used unless you can verify it isn't a rental. And preferably see that it works first. There are sketchy people who sell broken shit.  If you have tv and internet is to bite the bullet buy the g3100 new and buy an additional router of your own and daisy chain them. In 2 years time you will have saved more than the cost of both combined in the lack of rental fees...it's approximately 300 per year just to rent.

And i think the same applies to her as well. I dont think her character is bad at all, because she does actually what she's supposed to. Of course there are times where thinks are taken too far, either by the writer, director or actor, but for Nicky (and this case Deran) i think it's nailed across the board.

Yeah that‚Äôs a tough one, I think it all comes down to lack of resources on their end. If they were hard and fast (and accurate) on bans for this stuff, people would be less likely to do it, but they let it slide through lack of staff and resources for so many years that now they are trying to walk it back and it isn‚Äôt working.   I hope that they can figure it out because it‚Äôs such a missed opportunity. I may sound overly negative but it‚Äôs just frustrating to see content creators doing such a good job and knowing that this isn‚Äôt even close to as good as it could be with proper Jagex support

I agree with the second paragraph. I don't think that the fiery trash is enough to instigate a gunshot. But before that, Kyle was being chased. This man chased another person with a gun. many people would consider shooting that man right then and there as justifiable (I do not), but Kyle doesn't do that. Kyle runs away and tries everything other than killing the man before he shoots his weapon.

What antibiotic did you take?  I had to take doxycycline for 21 days for Lymes results &lt;&lt;&lt; as if life wasn't funny enough, it threw in that darn tick.  But then again, I was deployed and patrolled all sorts of terrain.   &amp;#x200B;  But still....the antibiotics are interesting?
OP Here. I wanted those things at 22, but instead went the traditional route of marriage &amp; homeownership. Thankfully no kids. Then divorced (10 years ago).  I'm 39 now, and certain I love the freedom and adventure of moving around/traveling/etc. It turns out you can get paid extra good money to travel for work since most with family life and houses don't like to leave them. And of course now, you can just work remote.

In my MP5,1 there is a reference design AMD 5700, flashed to XT and have been running it off the PCI  power (75W) and two mini 6-pins (2x75W) using a 2x6 mini-pin to 8-pin, as well as the EVGA PowerLink ( \~$15 on Ebay) to share the power from the 8pin molex to the 6 and 8-pin required by the reference design). Have not had any issues, even was able to do a mild overclock, and it appears the SP RX 5700XT only has 2x 6-pin (which is also supported by the power link with in-box connectors). I do not anticipate any issues for you.  I was dubious but after reading the research in the article below for my current solution, and I'm happy I did, hope you can be too!

It's hard to grapple with that truth, but it is true.  In her press conference when the amendment was announced, she talked about how important it is to address these root issues (mental health, poverty, education) but they need to be planned out and have every penny account for.  She then launched into her long, multi-year plan for expanding OPD that any budget cuts would interrupt.  So my question is this... she's been the mayor for 7 years now, where is her plan to address this?
You'll have to email support@poshmark.com and ask them to release the seller's earnings. There's no way for the seller to re-charge you unless they put up a new listing, have you buy it, and then you'd hit "accept" to release their funds.  Since the seller was slow/unresponsive in the first  place, I'd rather communicate with support instead of them.
I don't even have a clue why

I just watched [The Secrets Donald Trump Doesn't Want You to Know About: Business, Finance, Marketing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bAHb4yVko) that is just under an hour. it was taped before the elections in 2016, it touches base on the tax issue, and also basically nailed a number of other things when questioned about what would happen if trump was elected.

Sorry I was thinking of multi-character party WRPGs, like Baldurs Gate, and the interactions between characters within the party. In general I agree that RPGs (both WRPG and JRPG) are primarily focused on power fantasy, so the characters outside of the party tend to be oriented in that way.  I guess in general I just feel there is more "fawning" over one character in JRPGs than in WRPGs.  But it may be the games that I've previously played.  It's not really present in every game either.  Don't get me wrong, I prefer JRPGs to WRPGs for the most part.  I prefer a more linear story, I typically enjoy the world settings more, and I find them more humorous (usually in a 4th-wall breaking way when characters mutter their reactions to themselves).  I also tend to prefer the combat.  But some of the character tropes or event cliches I could do without.
Sure, you have great sources. What the hell is difficultrun.nathanielgivens.com? (Appears to be someone's personal blog.) Quillette? Seriously, what are these sources? Find something from a proper psychology, psychiatry, or medicine journal.  You strike me as someone who would Google "do vaccines cause autism?", scroll through forty pages of results until you found one that said "yes, definitely", and then take that as gospel.  I'm not here to do your research for you. Believe what you want, but the scientific consensus I have read suggests that rape is not primarily motivated by sexual desire.

This monitor is incredible. I had one before I upgraded to an X27 for the HDR. The XB273K only has hdr400, but it's a good implementation with a crude form of dimming, not the garbage hdr400 of most other monitors. The color accuracy and pixel response were amazing.  I paid $1200 for it at launch lol. This price is a steal.

Is anything thats an animal in a video game sonic
My old high school bio teacher yelled at me a few times because I kept using a purple pen instead of blue for my assignments ( he was kind of a dick, but taught well ). I told him that I thought I was using blue ink so he had me take a few color tests. Turns out I was red-green and blue-purple color deficient and he kept apologizing to me for the rest of the school year. To be honest, for me colors just seem a bit muted, as it gets really hard to differentiate colors if on a dark background.

Pass the roast beef and yorkshire pudding! Yes, at least in my family we do. My mothers side of the family is mostly English and German (but a little bit from all over europe), and my fathers side is Mennonite. We also make Pfeffernussen around Christmas (the Mennonites tend to add an n at the end, and they are really different from the common variety you see in Germany today).  Mulled cider too.
&gt;&gt; I don't see the metaphor you're trying to make.  &gt; Warping the way a person looks doesn't mean it's bad.  &gt; Bad dreams and sicknesses doesn't mean bad.  &gt; Gruesome also doesn't mean bad.  &gt; Pretty doesn't mean good, despite how we seem to use it as a shorthand for good in society.  This is deserving of being posted in Self-Aware Wolves.  You have just described the metaphor, and then described the *purpose* of the metaphor.   No, none of those things are bad in and of themselves. But they *are* shorthand, symbols, show-not-tell, ways of telling the audience that something is bad.

My belief is that suicide is understandable if you have a terminal illness and you're ready to go because staying alive for a longer period of time isn't in anyone's best interest. In some cases the suicide of a celebrity raises awareness of an issue or disease that needs more media attention. I'm thinking of Robin Williams here.  It's also understandable if you simply can't take it anymore in this life and you can't see a way to turn it around despite trying repeatedly. The BIG problem with this is that you could be wasting learning opportunities that you took great pains and much planning to set up for yourself, for your soul's growth. This means you'll have to come back and learn those lessons in your next life - you don't escape. You will literally be kicking yourself in the afterlife for not finding a better way of coping with life's trials and disappointments. There are also a finite number of incarnation spots available at any one "time" so you've basically thrown away a chance that some other soul would have liked to have.  I don't think there's anyone sitting in judgment of you.  In fact, it is you would be berating yourself for not sticking it out as planned and vowing not to do that next time. Nobody will be angry with you.  Some suicides ARE planned in order to help others learn lessons, and that is all agreed upon before birth in the pre-planning stages with the input of the soul group and spirit guides.   We all plan our lives with free will in mind, building in several exit points along the way that we can take if we feel the need and/or we feel that we've done what we came here to accomplish. If you have not yet accomplished what you set out to do, the goal is to NOT take those exit points and to stick it out to the end for "full learning credit," for lack of a better term. However, some souls are too tortured to stay so they leave at one of the prearranged exit points. This exit could be suicide, accident, illness, whatever.  To sum it up: Unless it was planned before you were born, suicide is a cop out. You knew ahead of time what you were getting yourself into, and in fact you set it up this way deliberately, so you really should see it through to the end if possible.  This is all of course my opinion.

 Hi, I'm sure that we can find you a durable and reliable laptop within budget. The [**Lenovo ThinkPad E15**](http://techneeeq.com/blog/index.php/product/lenovo-topseller-notebooks-lenovo-thinkpad-e15-gen-2-20t8-ry/) is my recommendation. It comes with a 6-core Ryzen 5 4500U processor, 8 GB RAM, a 256 GB SSD, and a 1080p 15.6" IPS display. This combination should easily handle general use tasks. Battery life is around 7-8 hours for light use and weighs around 4.7lbs. I would upgrade the RAM and storage yourself (you should still be able to stay within budget).

I got of tia sodium 20 gpd on April 1st 2020. I used tia for about 2 months where I ramped up dose over time. Most hellish Wd I‚Äôve ever experienced when trying to quit I reached out to my addiction dr and asked for help. Believe me, I tried to quit so many times, but it was beyond my capabilities. The dr started me on sub induction and gave me helper meds to make it through tia WD day 1-5. Diazapham was really helpful to knock me out day 1-3. I started 4 mg subs on Day 3. By day 5, I was feeling pretty good. I quit the subs about 25 days ago. Just stopped taking them. No Wd. If you have access to subs, I would definitely recommend that in a heartbeat.
I know, just wanted to give them a chance to recant.  I actually looked at the precipitation stats, June was actually quite wet compared to the last few years but July and August were dryer.  Ticks actually thrive in humid conditions best, but three years ago was exceptionally dry (it's actually interesting that from 2010-17 it was getting dryer every year and since 2017 it's been getting wetter) and that's when I noticed ticks were more of a problem... but the dryness was probably offset by the warmer temperatures.

Thank you for your thoughtful input. Definitely not interested in games with him, I put in alot of effort to make the relationship work and it was me who convinced him for two months to get therapy. He broke up with me needing his own space to fix things and also because he feels guilty for the way he treated me and my fault was that I tried to fix his problems which I learned the hard way is not possible. He needs to do his own work and all I can do is hope that he is working on himself because I witnessed how damaged he was from the toxic relationship. I really appreciate your honesty and sharing your story. I will just be patient and work on myself too. Thank you.
I sure hope it does.

I certainly think that graduate programs are the catalyst for burnout. Many programs (especially Masters) are not fully funded, leaving students to take on enormous amounts of loans. Then they must take a full course load, hold a job to feed themselves/pay rent, complete internships/practicums, have a social life (hopefully). Overworking oneself is often unavoidable in graduate school due to the variety of hats students have to wear. Of course, I am sure every program emphasizes self-care but that won't take away their stressors of paying their bills and completing assignments.   Then finally they graduate! Yay! Now is the exhausting job hunt, where good-paying jobs are scarce for new counselors. So they take a job in a CMH where they are given more clients then they can handle and most will be challenging cases. It is overwhelming, to say the least. Not to mention the low pay makes one resentful, they have a master's degree which they are now in debt for and start at $50k (maybe).   Two years grinding nonstop in graduate school then another two years in a CMH or similar will leave anyone burnt out.  I really feel for new counselors, the cost of living only increases while wages continuously decrease. We need to advocate for better, we of all people know the tole burnout takes on ones physical and mental health.

I got the numbers from imagining a day's worth of playing (assume somebody evolves at 8am - 8pm, let's forget about anybody who evolves later in the day and sleeps with their pokemon mega evolved).  30 minutes of actual use would be, VERY roughly speaking, twenty 1.5-minute uses, just to break it up. I suppose somebody COULD raid 20x in one day, or more, using their mega each time. But even then, they are using other pokemon in that battle, so really they are using the Mega-evolved pokemon LESS than this. Nowhere close to 30 minutes of mega usage raiding all day long.  If people are using it for Go Battle league, the max they can do per day is 30 battles. Do you think their mega pokemon is alive and in-use for an entire minute in each of those battles? No way.   A person who does all 30 GBL matches and raids 20x all in one day would be hard pressed to be using their mega-evolved pokemon for 30 minutes during all of that. Maybe the can, but not much more. Certainly not an hour of the 12.  Feel free to correct my math but I don't think you'll be able to correct the larger point, which is that most of the time the mega pokemon isn't being used, it just sits in your phone as a Mega doing nothing.
If people wouldn't believe what random people write on the internet, we wouldn't have such a large problem with people spreading conspiracy bullshit. But I won't discuss this any further. If you don't like how we moderate this sub, you are free to leave.

Mid is best. Once you get more comfortable bot and top are other options. I play him ADC with actually quite a bit of success but you've got to really understand his strengths and weaknesses.
Mechanical skill can get you far, but unless you understand game sense, ult tracking, cooldown tracking, dive engaging timing, and space control, being a dps, support, or even another tank wont get you to higher elo. Being a good winston isnt all about good mechanics (though primal control sets apart a master's tank from a gold), its about being aware of everything and anything not just click head 4head.
Not really relevant though unless he was detained.

It just sounds like you never properly processed everything.  Either individually or together.  You hysterically bonded with him when you didn‚Äôt know he cheated and recovered the relationship to a point to where you were happy until you finally discovered the infidelity but felt too invested to break up at that time.  I think seeking a professional will first help you recognize whether it‚Äôs a relationship worth saving. There‚Äôs too much here to resolve in a reddit response.  You need to process all of these emotions you are feeling and properly address them to decide whether to commit or cut bait.  And then, if it‚Äôs commit, bring him into the equation so y‚Äôall can process it together.  It‚Äôs okay to admit to yourself that you can‚Äôt get over it and it may be time to move on, if that‚Äôs the case.  Neither of you deserve to be stuck in this limbo state. It‚Äôs also ok to stay with him too.  But realize this.  If you don‚Äôt work to overcome these feelings, eventually the relationship will be ruined.  The resentment will grow on both of you until one day the love is no longer there. Seek counseling to work it out and learn some coping mechanisms to overcome this.

&gt;. There was an article in the Age that I can't find now about a construction site where they were testing everyone before work and getting the results back before the end of the working day.  [Here's that article.](https://www.theage.com.au/national/innovative-thinking-helps-industry-unmask-a-working-covid-solution-20200828-p55qbb.html) It's great work they've been doing for it. They test the masks of workers in batches of 5 to speed things up - if one mask in a batch comes back positive - all 5 are notified and have to isolate.  Because they test their masks each day, they can catch infections before they're symptomatic. It's probably going to be industry standard.

No, what Evan told you is that the `class DetailsViewModel: ViewModel()` is MVVM's viewmodel **if and only if you say it is.**  ViewModel in MVVM is a *concept.* AndroidX `ViewModel` class provides a convenient container which survives configuration changes. Therefore it naturally lends itself to being the primary choice when implementing the *ViewModel concept* in a MVVM application.  But AndroidX `ViewModel` class can just as well serve as Presenter in MVP. It's only a matter of how you handle view state updates.  * Does your AndroidX `ViewModel` expose streams of view states, which are observed by the View? Then your AndroidX `ViewModel` is *conceptually* a MVVM ViewModel. * Does your AndroidX `ViewModel` expose something like `fun attachView` and `fun detachView`, and it directly calls methods on the attached view? Then your AndroidX `ViewModel` is *conceptually* a MVP Presenter.  Therefore you can see how the name "ViewModel" chosen by the AndroidX team for that retained container is considered a poor naming choice.  The fact that this Reddit post exists is a testament to how poor the name `ViewModel` in AndroidX is. Of course I don't blame you in any way for being confused about this!

This. I can't count the number of times as a CSA I told a customer the policy only for them to demand a manager to come up and repeat it word for word, and now as a SFL I still see/hear CSA's going through the same, now I come up and say "I understand your concern but as CSA previously mentioned blah blah blah ..."   Its not hard to read between the lines of how a customer was acting towards your staff it just takes experience, i always ask my CSA afterwards their side and reassure they did the correct thing.   If your ever in a situation where your CSA is causing problems or is telling them incorrect information i do my best to distance them from the customer by either asking to cashier on another till or a task away from the register all together.  Edit: If there is something important you need to know immediately like an intoxicated customer trying to purchase alcohol I ask my team to pull me aside as I get there to let me know.

The human body is a complex system. Diabetes is a diseased state that your body gets pushed into. It makes your body less resilient to healing after injury or fighting off infection.

Even if we don't want to call it "MTX", it's definitely still something that falls into that "we just want to secure lots of money" mentality Jagex has and contributes to increasing your in-game power by bending to the thing Jagex wants you to do.  Similarly I'd say events are quite MTX-adjacent and have had a gigantic impact on ironman mode.
I've got the base model Lumie. Learnt after I bought it that I don't wake up in response to light, so I need an accompanying alarm. It's nice in winter to not wake up in a pitch black room but not great that the light doesn't wake me.   I'd suggest a dimmable smart bulb in your existing bedside lamp instead. I think Google and Alexa can be set to emulate a sunrise.
I'm the only one with normal morals in this whole sub
It has an amazing affect in combating headaches. I don't even remember when my last one was.

Crazy idea here though. What if they did a sequel series, but it was like, not the same characters as the originals?
Can‚Äôt relate
Hell yeah. Thighs&gt;tits. Both are great tho.   And yes personality is most important before y'all start shredding me

&gt; Thinner and lighter than the Macbook Air  Now that I have to disagree with. The X1 Carbon is noticably thicker compared to the MBA, but at least it has decent cooling and the replaceable SSD.
PREPARE THE MEGIDOLAON ELIZABETH
I think it gets added when it releases.
Heres the best advice I can give.  Dont keep stuff because its valuable, keep it if you want it.   If you sell something and it becomes valuable later on, you may feel sellers remorse but thats because you realize you could make more money off it.  If you sell something you like because its worth a lot, you are likely gonna miss it because... well you like it.

Agreed.  Warrants barely moved.  Experienced SPAC players aren't fooled.  I'd love to see an entry point in the 15.50 area.  Wouldn't be surprised if we saw this by Friday.
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing all month. The latest info I can find in his blog‚Äôs FAQ still states that it would come out by the end of July but that deadline came and went and it‚Äôs been radio silence on his end. It‚Äôs unclear whether the blocker is on his side or Audible‚Äôs or elsewhere.  Quite frustrating too as a big fan of his who is not really into audiobooks. I‚Äôm glad that these deals allow him to write more books and live comfortably. I didn‚Äôt even mind the 6-month wait, to be homest. Or longer if necessary. But the lack of transparency into why the ebook version isn‚Äôt available as promised has been frustrating as I was looking forward to reading this in August.
Is it really worth getting them fitted? Especially a putter
7am its not worth it!!!
&gt;or like Hannibal?  he would never be like Hannibal cuz his pathology is unique.   IMO: he tries to lead a normal veiled life, because of his empathy disorder. if he is surrounded by normality he would project normality  (like he did until he met Hannibal)  he rejects every fiber of himself when he goes thru his changes because, unlike Hannibal, he has morality. he understands the concepts of whats good and evil and that there's no evil in the civilize definition of normality.  so, he is mouring the world he would need to leave behind. which is everything that he knows, its a bit like he is the prisioner in Plato's "Allegory of the cave"
Walking or running (running away from it metaphorically and literally).
Depends, I would love to sing it, but the creative stuff is not my area.
I bought black ops 4 last week hoping league play would be playable but can‚Äôt find a match :( so I‚Äôm just playing pubs to get used to 150 health. I played MW2-BO3 and then started back up with MW so I‚Äôve never played a game with this high of a TTK
Imagine living in Florida.
absolutely. And it sticks around forever.
Thanks.
A novel you will never forget... This powerful and breathtaking novel is the story of four cadets who have become bloodbrothers. Together they will encounter the hell of hazing and the rabid, raunchy and dangerously secretive atmosphere of an arrogant and proud military institute. They will experience the violence. The passion. The rage. The friendship. The loyalty. The betrayal. Together, they will brace themselves for the brutal transition to manhood... and one will not survive. With all the dramatic brilliance he brought to The Great Santini, Pat Conroy sweeps you into the turbulent world of these four friends -- and draws you deep into the heart of his rebellious hero, Will McLean, an outsider forging his personal code of honor, who falls in love with a whimsical beauty... and who undergoes a transition more remarkable then he ever imagined possible.
There tends to be a sweet spot in the mid morning for the air. Before 10, too much fog keeping the smoke in. By the afternoon, the smoke is back. It seems that lower Marin and Half Moon Bay have been having consistently decent air (under 80) no matter what time of day though.
Neat subject matter. Thanks for the link.  Only quibble is with the use of a solid rocket sound for the liquid motors.

Here you go. [https://ibb.co/B3cmjQv](https://ibb.co/B3cmjQv)  I'm a total novice at this, do I just let the application decide which coin is more profitable? Also the general conscious is that I lower the power limits of the gpu and lower the core clock while raising the memory clock correct?

I think you're completely entitled to your feeling.  Coming from someone who has been both emotional and physical abuse while also losing an ex-boyfriend to drugs and alternate substances.... takes a toll on any person.   Your point of view is valued and I'm sure you're stronger today!
I haven't dated a man with a physical disability, but I'd like to think it wouldn't be a problem for me.  Besides, cochlear implants are legit cyborg tech. How fucking cool would it be to date a cyborg?!
&gt;A MAGA hat is the punkest thing you could possibly wear in 2020 Right, nothing says punk like a fucking campaign hat for the sitting president.

I have heard from people that Ethernet is much better, so I guess you could try an Ethernet cable.
But are apostates teaching anyone anything? Aren't the so-called apostates just revealing the truth about WTBTS? Is the ARC something to be taught or something to be known? Does anyone teach about the hypocrisy of the GB, the politics among the elders and the whole system itself? The person who wrote that article needs to wake up!

Im in mass. They just opened all the rec shops too to everyone right before they closed
Weapons and exotic animals I could get behind, assuming the weapons were destroyed and animals rehabilitated.  I'd rather see drugs decriminalization though, then there wouldn't be crimes for them.

Nope. not everyone by a long shot. We probably wouldn't even have the Hannibal TV series if Hopkins hadn't made the character iconic.

Full face cap for sure. There‚Äôs some cool videos on YouTube about how they did it. Something like 19 cameras to  an individual face, because so much of that game is determining if people are telling the truth from their expressions
