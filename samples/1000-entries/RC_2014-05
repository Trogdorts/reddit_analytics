He's right. The women I know who put zero effort into their appearance still get flirted with more often than a lot of guys I know who do put effort into their appearance.  In my observation, unattractive women complain that men *they find attractive* do not pay attention to them. Unattractive guys complain that *no women* pay attention to them. I mean, hell, even average-looking guys have that complaint.  Also almost every woman is at least a 6 on the attractiveness scale if they exercise enough to not be fat and put effort into their hair and make-up.

No they couldn't. Altec got destroyed by Yellowpete, Zion can't play meta, Shiphtur is good, Xmithie is an unknown factor but he's average by the most generous estimates and Xpecial is the only top-tier player there but you can be damned sure if he's not motivated and driven on TSM it's not happening in a challenger team for him.  In an LCS with C9, TSM, CLG and LMQ, thinking that that ragtag bunch could compete for top 4 is frankly laughable.

I was raised very strictly Catholic, but entering my mid-teens began to lose faith and willingness to practice religion to the fullest. I know identify as agnostic, but leaning towards atheism (my stance is that I have no evidence for a higher being, but I still concede that there is 0.0000001% possibility of there actually being a god or gods, so... agnostic fits better).   When I left the Catholic Church, I did experience a decrease in religion-based obsessions, but these were quickly replaced with secular ones. An intrusive thought about sinning, for example, has now become one about hurting others. However, it is nice to not have institutionalized obsessions, i.e. ones that are repeatedly reinforced by an authority figure, and to have slightly fewer "bad" actions on my list of things to worry about (blasphemy, disbelief, not going to mass, etc).   My obsessions didn't go away, and although I don't fear a god, I still catastrophize about fate/karma/whatever, just the general progression of life. In other words, whereas before I thought God would punish me for, say, accidentally using profanity, I now fear social rejection or being fired or having my family disown me... You get the idea. 
This is the best thing ever.

As a roleplayer this would please me very much - a conclusive finishing blow to an enemy while RP fighting, that has an actual working visual effect, as long as your opponent lies down at the right time.  I agree with your last note as well. I have played this game for a year and only just PvP'd my first time last week. I didn't get the point of finishers at *all*, and frankly, if I get bored of PvP, I'll feel the same way again.

Depends on the jurisdiction. You don't have to have a lawyer to have an effective testamentary instrument, although it frequently helps.  Generally there is a two witness requirement that probably would not be fulfilled in the case you suggest.  The person(s) most interested in enforcing the will would be the beneficiaries. The person(s) most interested in contesting it would be the heirs by intestate succession.

Which is probably the most important aspect when you really think about it.
Upon looking at your replies, I'll write an extensive comment.  Gangplank has a strength no one else has, although it might also be because his strengths aren't that major, and he has no giant weakness either. **He can build almost anything.**  You seem to want the following: 1) Solve mana problems, 2) become tanky, and 3) have considerable damage.   **1) Mana on GP** is most easily solved by having a need for Gauntlet, starting with Flask, or buying mana pots, which I highly recommend, because maxing W makes mana pots much more efficient than what health pots would give you. GP can easily avoid all-ins, and thereof, Flask is an ok route.  Also, when playing GP, you can't really poke as much as you want. GP was nerfed multiple seasons ago because his poke was impossible to deal with. Mana is the only thing which prevents GP from rolling over top laners. You have to manage GP's mana through decisions.   Personally I play like this: until I can get a substantial amount of poke power, I spend mana on sustain (W maxing), Q for short trades or securing last-hits when I'm not in range or I just AA'd another creep. You simply cannot poke as GP early on, because you'll run dry on mana too quickly, and that leaves you susceptible to being forced out of lane, or ganked.  2) Becoming tanky in lane with GP is not just through building items and resistances - maxing W/oranges is the way to go. Gangplank, when played smartly, is hard to force out of lane. It makes winning trades much easier, and it doesn't increase in mana cost. When trading as GP, you don't want the trade to go any further than slightly bad, because your healing can only do so much in a shorter timeframe.   3) If you want damage on GP, you rely on items almost completely. You have many options open to you - against heavy AD, there's Sunfire cape. Against magic dmg users, multiple items - Chalice if you feel safe (solves mana problems too), Visage to upgrade your W heal even further, Wit's End. In an even matchup you can build what you feel like without too much consideration. If you're winning however, you have a couple of options which are sure to snowball your lead. Statikk Shiv is good in any matchup which isn't bad, and due to its price you can also afford something like Giant's Belt while you're still laning.   Also, BoRK is NOT good on Gangplank unless you're up against a health stacker. You don't have any particular synergy with anything that it gives. You don't need the slow or the movement speed because you already have such things in your kit. You're also spending money on further amounts of sustain, which you could instead spend on better damage items.  http://imgur.com/soWTYCG  As you can see, I went Critplank and started Flask. BUT, I did get Executioner's and Warmogs, specifically to counter Irelia. In the other match, when I went up against Garen, I got ahead, snowballed out of control, and proceeded to go for the 1-shot build. How did I manage this? I don't spend mana unnecessarily; I out-sustain and win trades by cancelling CC. You can also bait people VERY hard. Gangplank's Q is not meant to be maxed and used on every possible creep. It works like an extended AA. Gangplank's whole kit is full of utility. It's hard to get away from Q + ult.   You just need to experiment on him.
Yes

You need to educate your husband, first of all. It's very difficult for human beings to relate to experiences so far outside the norm as depression, or mania, etc. If you don't experience depression, you just see it as "well I feel bad some days and I just suck it up and move on with my day and feel happier."  Education can never give someone that firsthand ability to genuinely empathize, but it, to an open-minded person, can at least give them *respect* for depression as a legitimate illness.   I would also recommend talking to him about saying you bring your problems on yourself - that's amazingly insensitive and unsupportive. Like I'm actually mad for you that he would say that - it's all kinds of fucked up to say to ANYONE, let alone your wife. It's demeaning and serves no fucking purpose - even in a different world where it was true, what is telling you that evne going to accomplish aside from letting him brush of your problems as just you being a bad person?  Other than that you need to evaluate if you are happy with the quality of life you have right now. That's a personal choice, but it's also a choice you have to make for your child. If your energy and mood aren't good enough to give them the best that you can give, I think it's really time to consider medication.   I know you had a bad experience with SSRIs, but there are obviously other options, and stick to your guns about not taking another SSRI unless the doctor can clearly explain why you should try again despite the previous effects. It is very possible to get on a medication dose that deals with your symptoms adequately without making you all fucked up in other ways.   Look into a therapist too, if you can afford it. It's good for literally everyone, and it can teach you coping mechanisms for dealing with your depression in a way that allows you to function at your maximum (taking into account the depression, obviously!).   I wish you luck. My personal feeling from what you're written is that the status quo isn't working for you (or why would you even be making this post to ask?) and that you should at least talk to a doctor. If your husband can't be made to see why that's a good idea, hopefully you're not in a position where his opinion can prevent you from seeking care.

They are actually worth something because if one of your laners get a first blood he can come back with wards/extra pots and outsustain the opposing laner. Now is it worth to waste flash so you get a kill? No, but it's also not worth giving up the free death if you get caught in that situation. So the best course of action would be to flash so you don't die and if you are about to get a kill, don't waste sums, let them waste theirs.  edit: also the xp advantage, as /u/kindlebee said

I'm a bit late to the party, but Naut has never really been appealing to me. Not only does it come across as entirely generic and uninspired, it's just trying so hard to be stereotypically modern that it has no character at all. It feels like every other "modern" design I've ever seen.  This subreddit has a lot of character to it design-wise, and I've always respected the fact that you guys took the time to make an original theme. Converting to this new /r/Naut phase seems like a really bad idea. There's nothing wrong with the theme that's currently being used, and it's a lot easier on the eyes.   Also..as the self-proclaimed /r/assassinscreed banner maker, I REALLY don't like what the new theme does to the banner. It appears to be limiting it in size, and does to it what iOS7 did to iphone backgrounds; they become irrelevant background images, as opposed to a solid part of the subreddits design.   **EDIT:** This is a smaller concern..but the floating banner on the top when you scroll down is really annoying.  **EDIT EDIT:** Slightly off topic, but related to banners. I'm not entirely sure HOW you could go about this (I should probably google it), but I think locking the banner of this sub to the right side of the screen instead of the left would open up many more options for banner design. The current one prevents any really great details from being added to the left side because of the need for a snoo and a logo, and obviously no big details can be added to the right side because of the fact that screen width varies and some or all of a banner "focus" could be made invisible to a viewer.   This forces banner details to either be center-focused, which again varies based on screen size (and is ugly), or non-existent like the current banner; I'm a fan of panorama's, but they're not very fun.  With this change you would have to move the mail / profile / karma feed over to the left a bit, but I think it's ultimately worthwhile.

If you build a mobile app in something like [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), you're essentially doing full stack web development. You could easily point to this and say that you've done web development AND mobile development once you're done with it. It will require learning a back-end language as well as the front-end stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript) but will give you a lot of experience in two areas at once.

The distinction between Maya and Brahman (even though Shankara doesn't exactly define this clearly from my understanding) is through experiential awareness of the single substance of reality, which it calls Brahman. The distinction between samsara and nirvana is discovered by *understanding* the *nonsubstantial* nature of experience in samsara. Buddhism's basis is in prajna, an unbinding wisdom of the interdependent nature of all things, and not in experience of a unifying substance as it is in Advaita. So yes, there is a big difference.  &gt; Nirvana is not seperate from the aggregates, like a pure self, but rather knowledge of the nature of the aggregates  Right, exactly - but that isn't anything like what Advaita teaches. There is no empirical *understanding* of the true nature of reality.

Sadly, you see this a lot with female dog owners, or where a couple owns a dog because she tries to be "nice" to the dog instead of being its master. Confuses the hell out of the poor animal. Because it thinks its in charge of her, and this probably stresses the poor thing out because it keeps getting mixed signals.  Being clearly dominant and in charge of your dog will make it happier and easier to live with, handle, all around better.  It's sad how few people understand this.
Completely understand your viewpoint -- my only point was that people in the IRC seemed to be implying that they were offering us 16.5% equity for the 200k BTC which is false.  Really I think it comes down to whether you think 16.5% equity and the audit is worth 10m dollars. I think it is, but I understand you don't and respect that you are at least laying out facts.  In terms of the 10% bounty that people are up in arms about, hell if it motivates them to actually hire who they need to hire and find the coins, then I'm all for it. Any non-funded audit with no bounty is going to be run by amateurs who find nothing.  In terms of cooperating with the Class Counsel I don't see the problem as I think Sunlot (or any takeover company) would want to find as much of the assets as possible for their bottom line.  In terms of immunity I really dont care if Jeb McCaleb and Gay-Buchery (wrong spelling I'm sure) get immunity or not. You know what I care about most? Getting the most I can out of this shitty situation. Mark is the only one who 100% needs to take a fall, if there are other insiders and they get immunity but help us find coins then I'm okay with it. It's not "fair" but life isn't fair and at this point we ALREADY got screwed, getting "revenge" isn't going to get us our coins back. I care about my own personal bottom line and that's it.  Liquidation provides no hope of ever getting above a small % back. I would rather gamble with Sunlot and see what happens than have it go to Liquidation. I'd prefer OKCoin but I think way too many people are being immature and raging at Sunlot for "scamming" when really they're just still reacting to getting scammed by Gox in the first place. Nobody wants to face reality that these deals are the best we are going to receive.  Take emotions out and try to focus on what option gives us the best chance of the highest payout. To me, that is ANYTHING BUT liquidation.
I don't think so.  Based on [this page](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/blog/11868609/hearthstone%E2%84%A2-closed-beta-patch-notes-1004217-become-a-legend-12-10-2013) it says:  &gt; Legend rankings in your region will only be displayed for the top 10,000 Legend players, so battle on if your Legendary mana crystal doesn’t show a number.

&gt;Some RP men advocate only giving the woman an orgasm every second time (or at least not focusing on it as much) or to rarely give oral to make sure they don't become too beta in trying to please her too much. It kills the chemistry.  That sounds like an awful strategy for a marriage. If my husband couldn't get me off I would just prefer to use a toy when he isn't home.   However,   &gt;women get off on selfish male pleasure and dominance.   is why I have given him maybe one duty blowjob in the years we've been together. Even if my lady bits just aren't desiring of attention, I still love to pleasure him. 
I don't understand how that fits into "fraud" though. You're not deceiving anyone by melting metal down and selling it.

I'm Indian, so I can kind of explain this (obviously India and Pakistan have different cultures, but not *too* different). /u/OverkillAlex nailed most of it. Southeast Asians especially tend toward wanting lighter skin. The whiter you look, the better.  Everything is about "fairness" (meaning light skinned). You compliment a woman by telling her she's fair. Being fair skinned is a huge advantage and being darker skinned is considered lower class and unattractive. If you google "Indian actress," you're going to come up with lots of very light skinned Indian women.  From wikipedia:  &gt;2012 sales of skin lightening creams in India alone totaled 258 tons[3] and the global market for skin lighteners is projected to reach US $19.8 billion by 2018 based on sales growth primarily in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.[4]  Whiteness is considered more attractive. It's not because whiteness is inherently more attractive, it's just cultural and something we're all exposed to from childhood even in the US. It's really, really bad in post colonial countries (such as India and Pakistan).

The lack of discovery is not the problem, Removing key areas would be a very dumb move. The problem is how easily this info can be obtained with no effort put in to it. Sharing information shouldn't be restricted on it's own, but it should be made a ton harder. With this in-game communities would be so much more meaningful when you HAVE to do things together. You can't just give someone a line of information when the person has nothing to use that info for. You would have to show them how things are done: the road to a nearby town, the way out from the mines, a neat landmark etc.
Learned on bike tires, moved up to motorcycles and a bit tougher. Dirt bike tires just have to be done with minimal tools so you can do it on side of road. For my versys, and other bikes, I picked up a noMar tire changer classic. They are made locally, went over and owner showed me how easy, then let me change a couple tires. Bought one on the spot.   Getting ready to spoon on a new set of pirelli scorpions on the versys this week. 2 sets a year per bike, it pays for it self quickly.

It is typically set up so that printing can ONLY be completed through a print server.  That has an added bonus in rooms with more than one printer. If you set up your print server correctly, you can have it print to whatever printer is available with paper and toner. So say printer A is out of toner and a student doesn't know that - the printer will automagically print to printer B instead.

Unless you plan on going for a 4xGPU setup, that is not really a problem.  [this](https://www.komplett.no/msi-970a-g43-socket-am3/773523#!tab:extra) is the cheapest AM3+ MB I can find in my preferred on-line shop. It's just shy of $100. It has 2 16x PCIe 2.0 slots. Or, if you'd like, plenty for a dual GPU setup. If you need more than 2 GPU's at the same time, and don't plan on using two "dual GPUs", then this setup is not ideal. But this is the cheapest. And really, there are very few games that scale at all at 3 GPUs. If they do, scaling usually goes like this:   * 1 GPU = 100%  * 2 GPU = 195% +-  * 3 GPU = 260% +-  That third GPU will at best only give 50-60% more performance , rather than 95 % for the second GPU.   This is in addition to the fact that there is next to no scenario today with "consumer" GPUs that will even reach 8x PCIe 2.0 needs. Last time I saw any test of the kind of how much the PCIe link speed affects game-performance, it was everything above 4x PCIe 2.0 is "good enough". That's a few years ago, so call it 16x PCIe 2.0 is "good enough" today. All in all, unless you are running 3 AMD r9 290x at insane resolutions, as in multiple 4K displays, there isn't gonna be a PCIe bottleneck any time soon.   To sum up, I don't care what you may end up buying, but choosing intel over AMD now, unless you go to the socket 2011 platform, and you want multiple GPU's, you are choosing between 2 * PCIe 2.0 16x or 2 * PCIe 3.0 8x. Or in other words, same shit, different wrapping. Not, multiplexing doesn't "fix" the problem. The CPU still only has a limited amount of PCIe lanes.  DISCLAIMER: There are exceptions, but they are few and far between.
The best way to do this... avoid situations where there is a high probability of police intervention and conduct yourself as if that is your intention. How do you do that, you may ask? Make smart choices, chose your associates wisely, don't fight people in public (esp. police), don't drive with anyone you don't trust, don't accept things from people you don't trust, don't drive a car that attracts a lot of attention, don't keep a gun/drugs/paraphernalia in your car, make sure your car is insured/properly licensed, never speed in your car, don't drink and drive, don't be in a gang, don't dress like you are in a gang, don't drink/do drugs in public, don't buy drugs off the street, don't sell drugs (esp. on the street), don't steal shit (esp. from stores), avoid parties with underage drinking, don't have sex with an underage person, don't rape anyone, avoid houses with serious drug use occurring, avoid riots, do not instigate or provoke law enforcement officials, steer clear of others fighting.  If you do those things, there is 99% chance you will never have a bad interaction with police.

it's different for everyone, i've had carb cravings since a few days in, not very bad ones, but just really wanting a bean burrito from taco bell or gummy bears, it's not been very bad, def not enough to break keto.

Part of the law allows teens seeking an abortion to appeal to a judge to strike the parental notification clause, and it's used relatively often.  Hopefully the teen will be seeking services at a Planned Parenthood or similar organization, who will partner her with an attorney who, pro bono, will file the appropriate paperwork for an emergency ruling.  Happens regularly, but not enough.

Just remember, if you do high intensity exercise, your body will be using up a lot of glycogen/glucose, which is what you get from eating carbohydrate. If you want to maintain an extreme regimen of this kind of anaerobic exercise, you're going to have a horrible time if you don't up your carb intake to compensate. Even if you up your fat intake so your macros are sound (while being low carb), fat still isn't going to provide the necessary fuel for those kinds of workouts, especially if they're regular. Fat is burned for fuel by the body, generally speaking, at lower intensities (think marathon pace running). The incident you described in your OP was probably your brain running out of glucose. I'm all for low-carb, but I don't think it's compatible with a regular high-intensity workout regimen. So first make sure if you're low-carb you're getting enough fat and your macros are good, i.e. around 65% fat, 30% protein, 5% carbs. Then recognize the limitations of that diet in terms of fueling certain levels/types of exercise, then either eat more carbs (and lower the fat) or do less exercise.
Dooooo iiiiiiit.

That is what people forget about vanilla/BC WoW. People specialized in what they thought was most fun. For some that meant 'hardcore raiding'. For others that meant mastering PvP. For others that meant just leveling up or doing achievements.  The point is, you never did everything, you had to specialize. Which meant that it seemed only X% of players killed Y boss, but not every player even CARED to kill Y boss. Not every player wanted to raid, they enjoyed other aspects of the game.  The game was so deep back then you didn't need to do everything to have fun, you just needed to do something.

Try and find out if there's something else going on with her, too. Most of the people posted up here identify as having various mental illnesses, anything from depression to some kind of ptsd, that is intimately connected to their travels down the tumblr road. It's very unlikely for someone who is completely stable to go full-on tumblr warrior so quickly and fervently. If she can get the background issues dealt with, she'll be doing herself a favor.  Also, read up on and reference literature that deals with the same set of problems she's invested in in a deeper and more rigorous manner. Everything from Dr. King, whom she won't be able to reject, to proper feminists who acknowledge men's issues. Being passionate about injustice is a good thing, and can be channeled into more appropriate forms by exposure to better ideas.   The one thing you can't do is defeat her views by argument. There are too many emotional investments at work for that to happen. Even if you make a completely rational case against one of her ideas, she will find some way to rationalize it away. You have to let her slowly transition out of it.

Close all the windows so nobody hears what you're doing, turn the stove on, the hotter the better, and start spraying your weed down with your butane. then filter that through WHITE coffee filters and dab it up, no purging needed

To counterpoint this, many older games have "cheats" (advantages) built in to keep an even playing field. Goldeneye had a good system for this.  Most multiplayer online games simply don't have this function anymore.  
[25%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements) of the mass of the Milky Way galaxy is helium.  There are "pockets" of He floating around, however, they are intermixed with hydrogen and form gas clouds and populate the interstellar medium.  The He atoms don't really accumulate since there is no force acting on them to do so. They are lighter than other molecules and atoms in the atmosphere and need less energy to escape the Earth's gravity well. Once in space they disperse into the rest of the Solar system, but I am not sure if they end up on the larger planets or not.

I think it's important to note that God isn't defined in any tangible way (Abrahamic religions). Many religions use phrases like God is "outside of time and space", which is kind of like saying God is north of the north pole, it doesn't actually mean anything. My personal view is that I will evaluate the evidence for or against as soon as someone tells me *what God is.* Until then, I will remain an atheist, simply for the reason that I don' believe in a god or gods.
And it's gone...

Thing is that it varies so much year on year.  I mean compare Scotlands performance last year to this year and there's been pretty dramatic changes (though they're obviously still the strongest region, but not by the same margin).  Likewise if you went back a few more years you'd find the West region doing really well (Exeter were really strong 2009-2010 for example) but only scraped into Div 2 this year.  I think the important thing is that the top 8 teams in the country make it through, after that if it remains in a tournament format rather than a league you're going to struggle to get an effective ranking outside of the top 4.  For example if a teams knocked out at the quarter finals by the eventual winners, does that mean they should be forced into a maximum of 5th place? Definitely not. They could be just as good a team as the people who eventually end up second place!

Was gonna say you're probably a troll, but unless you're playing a long game, I don't think you are.  What I do think you are is a self hating gay, and probably bottom a lot.  And I agree with what someone said a little bit ago, you hate anyone that'll consent to sex with you for being 'too gay'.  Go piss up a rope, friendo.

* Season 1 - Slow build; not overly entertaining. ~~Wasn't hooked until 8th episode or so.~~ The CDC scene was okay, but meh. * Season 2 - Slow at first, great mid-season, decent end of the season. At around Episode 2 I really wanted to see where things were going. * Season 3 - Lots of governor filler to flesh out the episodes; bad ending to try and stretch out Governor Storyline * Season 4 - Lots of meandering around; good ending to governor's storyline. Last half of the season was a bit tedious.  The show lacks energy in moving from one place to another, and always has. I like the show a lot, but, for example, Prey? That episode was mostly filler that didn't amount to anything.  Edit: Changed Season 1 and Season 2 slightly because it wasn't until season 2 that I got hooked on the show, apparently

I love you too! Can confirm all of this. I was so nervous pulling in, and the whole 2 hour drive there, but as soon as I saw your face I was excited and calm and happy all at the same time. Instantly hugged and kissed, and just didn't let go of each other for hours. We're totally physically in sync, and it was awesome being able to actually kiss.   Also, thanks /r/LDR! You guys rock! We will still be about 2 hours away from each other (by car), but that's way better than the 5 hour time difference we used to have :)
Focus on improving your life, not trying to control every biological process your body performs. If you don't fap or have sex regularly, you will eventually have a wet dream, probably. It's natural.  FWIW, I've seen a lot of guys post that they dream about relapsing. It seems like it's either a symptom of withdrawal, or a natural part of your brain rewiring itself, or both.

Hard limits on health mechanics early in the game and then a gradual easing of those restrictions, paced well and in a lore and theme-appropriate and manner (buff spells, rings, shields or perks), is my preference. They're generally the most nuanced and rewarding systems; they have an achievement arc much longer than both the short-term health solutions in the op, and they will often have interesting writing, art, mechanics, and long-term balance effects tied in.

Just because some ideas like the "refrigerator mother" were discredited doesn't mean Freud is bunk.

I just did my coffee table and end tables, chalkboard paint is wicked awesome. You can find it at any major home Reno store (rona, home depot, etc.)  The only thing is, you really have to follow the directions on the box: put a layer if primer first, avoid brushing or rolling too much, do two thin layers rather than one thick one, and you can't write on it for 3 days.   Other chalkboard options include chalkboard contact paper or chalkboard kitchen stickers. These are both peel and stick and available off of amazon.   Hope this helps

Seems like a pretty fundamental question to get answered before you go any further down this path. For every person who withdraws from the world to protect their spiritual purity or whatever, another person has to work harder to support them. Convincing yourself that you don't want to have a job or pay rent seems like it might be a bit easier than convincing someone else to pay them for you.

I've been wondering this too. I always see posts that say "Artificial sweeteners can cause stalls" but then it's followed with "...because they cause you to crave more sweets or binge on non-keto foods."   I'm not sure I've ever seen a post where someone knew 100% that ingesting an artificial sweetener (with no additional binge-eating, overeating, eating more sweets) caused a stall.

So it's basically a program called Every 15 Minutes where they simulate a drunk driving crash. It was all staged, but they had seniors play the parts of drunk students and most of them "died". We were on a football field and ambulances, police, and a fire truck drove around the track before picking up the "injured" kids. One of the county's helicopters landed and took a kid strapped to a gurney away. Tomorrow we get to see part two, the "funeral."
Didn't Kobe do that?
Excellent information thanks! I will consider the broth and make sure to pick some up. If I'm right that should also be a decent source of salt?  Yah the Pepsi is going to be tough and I'm expecting a rough week but I think it'll be worth it in the end! I've tried a few of the dishes my girlfriend makes that are vegi based and they aren't too bad. I really enjoyed the colyflower rice! Picked up a cookbook for some additional ideas.  From what I've read using sea salts over table salt is suggested to keep up my salt intake. Once I'm well into the diet I can slowly start to cut down the salt usage?
Wow! I didn't know it was a big event! Thank you for the detailed explanation! I think I'll go check it out. I looked up online and there seems to be quite a bit of participating stores near my area.. Any tips for a first timer venturing out alone?

Wow. I lined the fields 10 years ago but didn't retain the foot measurements. Awesome. If I could add anything to this at all it would be a few corps tricks.  Make sure to be friends with the kitchen staff because you will probably be lining when everyone else is eating/sleeping during an early arrival. Assign a captain, so that the D.M. can wake that person up and the captain can wake everyone else up.  Don't inhale the paint too much.  Always be certain that you set the lines right when starting the backfield. After lining the first parallel line to the center, run towards where the press box would be about 15 yards and be sure you're not making them diagnals!  Get as much sleep as possible when on the bus when the arrival will be early in the morning like 3 am. You will be up just before sunrise to set another field at the new site.  Field paint makes a good refresher for white shoes.  Field paint makes sunglass frames all snazzy looking.  Eventually you can suggest to get rid of tick marks and stuff to support form recognition rather than dot following.  Etc.
You have numbers for all 8 fundamental regions of a 3 event Venn diagram including the outside, P(-A and -B and -C). So for anything else, it's a sum.  I'll use P(AB'C') notation instead of P(A and -B and -C). Then  P(A) = P(ABC) + P(AB'C) + P(ABC') + P(AB'C')

True, but remember the old towpath for the canal is literally a CSX line, and the non-canal side of the towpath is the James. Massive quantities of hazmat travel along that line multiple times a day.  Granted crude is pretty unpleasant, our line dumps stuff in every now and then. Last major spill I can recall was Sept of 2004 when something like 30 loaded coal cars derailed, with several ending up in the canal. It wasn't exactly publicized until a private citizen came upon it the next day and notified the RTD.  The railroad also used to (maybe still do) use a great deal of fogging herbicides that undoubtedly got into the canal.

&gt;But one day after some wine, she is inclined to do it? Is that still violating consent since she disagreed before but now is consenting / offering under intoxication?  I already said - this is not illegal, it's just *fucking shady*.  &gt;But if she actually agreed verbally, how do you know if she's really up for it or just drunk?  Wait until she's more sober, and **ask**.  &gt;Does it mean that as soon as alcohol touches someone's lip, consent goes out the window because even if they verbally agree / offer sex, it can still be rape since the decision was made under intoxication?  If you are incapable of judging how drunk someone is, don't have sex with that person if they've had any alcohol recently. If you're capable of telling the difference between when someone has had a couple drinks but they're fine, and when they should not be allowed to drive, then use your judgement.  You could always talk to someone sober about this and circumvent the whole issue, of course. My boyfriend and I fuck each other a lot when one or both of us are really drunk, because sober we were both like "Yeah you can have sex with me when I'm drunk".  &gt;Say your GF was never down to anal, but in a drunken night she agrees / offers anal. What happens then?  Was my post confusing? JUST DON'T. It's PREDATORY AS SHIT. You KNOW she doesn't ever want to do it, you KNOW she wouldn't if she was sober. THAT IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOMEONE'S INTOXICATION. Wait for her to sober up, and talk about it THEN.

How does one determine what is long or short? Paul wrote this with emphasis on indicating gender. Man looks like man, a woman looks like a woman. In that I agree. But its a stretch trying to compare hair length with sexual immorality such as homosexuality which was also very much labeled as sin in the old testament. Now I do understand your point, However in Peter it says scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit. Paul was sent by Christ to bring his word.  And Again the teaching of the Catholic Church is very clear on this. That is not to say homosexuals should be relegated from society but it is a sin, and you (not saying you specifically) shouldn't propagate such sin. However it isn't a special sin, premarital sex, adultery, and divorce are just as bad.

Does that bother anyone else in your family? If you and your wife are fine with being reclusive, then chances are she is too. The only thing is kids at school might be curious about why she doesn't do other "southern" things, the same way I was curious why my family didn't go to church. My parents were very supportive about me exploring that if I wanted, but ultimately I just was trying to figure out where I fit in with everyone else.

I heavily disagree with his rating on Light's Justice. For one it gives you removal for the early game, which the paladin class lacks. Secondly it's 4 damage for 1 mana which is incredibly mana efficient. Trump says it's too low impact but it just feels that way because its effect is spread over 4 turns and those 4 turns are often spread far apart.

I work for Target. You are looking at the "Iowa City" Target, not the Iowa "City Target".  Plus, the store is Dinkytown is not going to be a City Target. It's going to be a [Target Express](http://www.abullseyeview.com/2014/01/target-tests-smallest-format-yet-introducing-targetexpress/).
&gt; It is imbalanced. In defensive midfield we lack a playmaker, or at least a formidable pairing to Matic (who only joined us halfway through the season).  Didn't Mourinho bring in Salah, Schurrle and Willian just this summer (winter for Salah). For shit tons of money too. From that Mourinho is at fault for this "imbalanced midfield" so it can be used as a criticism of his performance this year.  I think you could poke similar holes in City and Liverpools squads if you looked hard enough (as Chelsea fans here are doing), so I don't think you've been at any disadvantage to your competitors.
Actually there was plenty of discussions between at that gen but it was all about polygons. I believe the numbers were:  Dreamcast - 20 million polygons  PS2 - 66 million polygons  Gamecube - 35 million polygons  Xbox - 100 million polygons  Then there was the argument about the "real" polygons used per second that included shading and textures and so on.   Edit:  Forgot to mention, PC gaming back then was pricey because the parts were just so damn expensive. I also believe at the time the Xbox was right on par with higher end PCs or even better in regards to graphics, but that was the day when Nvidia was just starting their GeForce cards.

Designated zones is not world pvp. World pvp is when you can be killed without wanting to cause trouble. World pvp is staying on your toes, looking out for gankers and troublemakers while leveling or questing. World pvp is helping a friendly out because some high level guy is being a big douche.  Your last statement is completely subjective. I like wPVP, I like EVE pvp, although I understand that this game isn't a sandbox mmo, wPVP is the only sandbox element that exists in themepark mmos. I don't like honour codes or fair fights in the open world, I like emergence and spontaneous battles and skirmishes. That's not saying I don't like normal PVP, but wPVP is its own thing.

:)  No, it's not a surprise. It's that this subreddit doesn't like talking about politics, so I've been avoiding it.  And while I understand (and share) the idea that the MRM does not relate to any political ideology, if I criticize a group of democrats then I am seen as a pro-republican, and vice versa.  It's almost funny, because what I loathe the most is the partisanship that rules many western democracies -like my country-.

I definitely agree about community collaboration aspect. We'd hold planning meetings and as exec members, we'd come up with a general trip plan and then let those who were interested in going on the trip help pick the details and plan the menu. The execs would still handle getting everything together and making sure we had everything when we went to leave, but just having the members help plan it makes them feel more involved and it was less work on our part.

&gt; literally drive someone insane  *Literally* literally. The show is *constantly* referencing Call of Cthulhu and SAN points. But it's also useful to note that the humour in the show is not *purely* referential, there's a lot of slapstick, sex jokes and a couple of seiyuu jokes. When I watched both seasons a good 95% of references (seriously) flew over my head, but I still found it fantastic and hilarious (even though the story is infuriatingly stupid). And both seasons have awesome OPs.  ^^Plus ^^I ^^actually ^^think ^^the ^^romance ^^element ^^is ^^a ^^little ^^more ^^complex ^^than ^^people ^^give ^^it ^^credit ^^for  But also:  &gt; \*likes Nyaruko-san\* ...I have bad taste...

But its also speculated that Shinsoo is the Axis field itself, which means that Phantanium could be vulnerable inside the Tower.  But as I stated, I think its unlikely, since SIU said that its unlikely that Phanaminum will ever appear in ToG  Also, the whole Axis can only be killed by other Axis is not necesserily canon, since it originates not in ToG but in earlier works of SIU.  From the wiki: "It is discussed that Shinsoo itself may be the Axis field of the true god the Tower was built to reach. In this case manipulating Shinsoo may be able to harm Phantaminium as it has the properties of an Axis field.  "

No the calories don't really affect weightloss, unless you are eating 5k plus calories a day.  most people think that weightloss works as follows. Calories in - calories out = Weight loss or gain.   But its actually, weight (Fixed) = Calories in - calories out  Basically, your weight is finely regulated by hormones (Insulin in paticular) and is fixed. Its hard to get it to deviate from it's preferred weight. And when you do drop below, you will compensate by eating more or burning less.  Basically keto fixes that misregulation of weight, by controlling the amount of insulin, and you just naturally start to lose weight. (Through decreased appetite, and increased energy)

And the other mods have benefits over IC2 for most players. The only original game play element that IC2 has over most mods now is the ability to overclock their machines to ridiculous speeds. I like that there is competition for an idea that way I can choose which way I want to play. Sure IC2 was first with some ideas but that does not mean they get exclusive rights to said Idea. They get the exclusive rights to their code and textures.

I would argue that while the public may trend left, congress certainly has not. [This graph](http://xkcd.com/1127/large/), made by Randall Munroe (oblig xkcd) details in as mathematically and unbiased a way as he could, the makeup of congress in terms of ideology.  The only time any significant portion of our congressional houses pushed far left was just before the civil war. Conversely, we are currently in one of the deepest pools of far-right belief in our congressional history.  This may not necessarily reflect our populace's current trends, but to claim we've never had more social programs is outrageous. We've seen the passing of Reconstruction, the New Deal, and more. The first 6 years of the 1980s saw a higher percent of our GDP go to welfare spending than current predictions expect us to be spending by 2015. [Citation: Graph at top of page](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/welfare_spending)  From the same page: &gt;the Great Recession of 2009-10 produced an explosion in welfare costs to a peak of 4.75 percent of GDP in 2010. Welfare costs are expected to decline to 2.88 percent of GDP by 2015.  While our peak may have been the highest it's ever been, it also dropped off faster than many have historically. There was an injection of welfare spending to keep the American public afloat while the banks did their best to ruin our economy, and then it subsided quickly as it was seen to be no longer needed in such quantity.  We might have more regulations, which I generally don't like, but such is the way congresses march, and most of those regulations are their own form of corporate welfare, written for and bought by companies to make money or lock out competition.

We are not saying that it should be cheaper right off the bat. Its just that Microsoft is selling this game w/ the promotion on THEIR OWN STORE! Not GameStop, MICROSOFT!  There should be no excuse as to why they cannot do it for the digital copy as well.   It's stuff like this that makes the people that want to go all digital (which is more people then expected) angry. And it doesn't help that the Xbox Team allegedly says that they are "looking into" promoting digital games. That's hypocritical status.  EDIT 1: I'm editing this because I've gained some reputable insight as to why this is so. After Listening to the podcast 'Rebel FM' Episode 213 (right around 1hr into the episode), Arthur Gies reads a question very similar to what everyone here is debating about... Digital sales.   Arthur says that the prices for games on Xbox Live are left completely up to the publisher at hand. Since the publisher sells the software both digitally and physically, prices have to remain at the standard MSRP until the "contract" is up for retail stores. Also, slashing the prices for digital games would severely aggravate brick and mortar stores, meaning that the publisher could have a lot to lose since digital games on Xbox are out of the retailers control. And it's less of concern on other platforms besides the Xbox platform.  This makes a whole lotta sense. Since Watch Dogs is owned by Ubisoft, Ubisoft has the final say in the price they set on the digital market place. The reason why retailers sometimes have promotions on new games is because they buy the game in bulk and since they actually own the games now, they can set the price to whatever they want, promotion or not.  Hope this cleared up things guys. It's would have been cool if microsoft used the same rules as retailers for the Xbox Games Store. Then they could run sales and promotions an new digital games. It seems like that is how Sony does it.

When people ask 'questions' just to show their knowledge off in class. 
Ignore most of those rules, especially about what you can eat and drink. I made the mistake of reading "What To Expect When You're Expecting" when I was pregnant and it made me super paranoid. Just eat healthily and educate yourself about the reasons WHY you're not supposed to eat/drink certain things. Like yeah, mercury in fish is a problem, so just research which fish are least risky and stick to those as much as possible. You're obviously educated and have critical thinking skills... Do what you can to learn about what the real issue is and what the risk is. So many of these "rules" about pregnancy and babies start with minuscule chances of something mildly bad happening and generalize it to "avoid this all the time, no matter what." It's crazy-making.

Oh yeah! Of course!
I'm a millennial who was generally on the opposite side though most of those events. I like how he throws us a bone when "even relatively conservative millennials" agree with him, but pretends we don't exist for the rest of it.   Some of us were actually organizing that "astroturf corporate movement", rather than picking fleas out of each other's hair in a New York park while yelling incoherently. 
If you count just bent able to finish the levels then yes, but if you intend to medal each track I think the difficulty scales pretty linearly.   Medium tracks are 80% easy jumps, 20% medium jumps Hard tracks are 80% medium jumps, 20% hard jumps Extreme tracks are 80% hard jumps, 20% extreme jumps  It's just that the only thing harder than those hard jumps are the ones like you mentioned.

Exactly a month ago. Did help desk and sysadmin work for three years. I wanted a new environment and always wanted to be in networking with hardly any experience.   But I worked really hard at my old job and took on a lot of duties and self taught myself alot of stuff. 
Very interesting indeed. But I think the real question is ................*extended pause for dramatic effect*............ where is Tyson!?!?
Don't you kinda get the irony that on one hand you are dismissive of other people's abilities "fancy way of saying you are a game tester" or "sysadmin who has never developed a game before", and in the same fucking post you say "I won't go dropping my credentials on the internet, its tacky".   Dude, you don't live in a glass house... all that shits been shattered.  You live in an empty field surrounded by shards of glass and tons of stones...

Hell yeah! Great work. I love active development.  2 moniker tests /u/changetip   My only critique at this point would be if we had the option define the moniker value in BTC instead of national currency. This would allow users to add 'bits' or 'uBits' as they see fit, although it might be confusing to new users when they try to mimic custom monikers that they haven't added yet. I think we should worry about that as the problem arises though.   Now to think of some creative monikers. :)

Are you a white American with no strong ties to Italian or Irish heritage or are you European? As a Mexican-American, when asked in the US what is my background/race/ethnicity, I just say Mexican even though I was born and raised in the US. I have an American accent so it's obvious that the American part is there.   I only use Mexican-American online to make it more clear I'm not a Mexican from Mexico. And if I travel to other countries, I say I am American. Only if they ask for more information do I mention the Mexican part. However, if I travel to spanish speaking country that isn't Mexico, I do make a mention of both the Mexican and American parts.
So, I'd love to ask comment something relevant to your post here, but I've seen you commenting on shit on reddit before and have yet to see you explain to someone what LB is. I've speculated on it maybe standing for long boarding but I can't confirm it. Help me out here?

Just to clarify, our system is Pathfinder.  Player-suggested content creation is out of the question. He's made it very clear that the world (story, pantheon, etc) is his baby. He is, however, very flexible when it comes to allowing a variety of PC back stories. He's also a bit flexible when it comes to play styles (i.e. all combat vs all RP or somewhere in between), although he favors combat.  His worst tendency is to arbitrarily nerf (sp.) characters after they're already halfway completed. If he decides that a class or race ability is overpowered, it's out the window. Really no negotiation involved.  Also, he's outright refused to run parties with more than 3-4 players max in the past. Most of the players want a larger group, but understand that doing that is really his prerogative.  Sorry about the wall of text - those are the problems that come to mind immediately.
Thank you!

For my choice I'm assuming that whoever I choose to protect me is also whose universe I'll be in at the time. Luffy all the way. Worse case scenario, I have an infinitely persistent guy who is also extremely durable, strong, and fast guarding me. His Will of the D. is basically all I'd need, as it basically means that as long as he has the will to accomplish something, he'll overcome it. That's the worst case scenario. Best case scenario: His allies are also taking part in the protecting and I have the Strawhat Crew as well as the Whitebeard Pirates, Red Hair Pirates, Heart Pirates and like 3 nations who have my back. Plus because it's the One Piece universe, I probably wouldn't die until about a week of dialogue has occurred. edit: be aware that I don't recognize/haven't gotten around to watching about half of these characters.

I would really like to tell a close friend of mine that she has a compulsive lying problem. Everyone that knows her recognizes it but no one confronts her. She really is a nice person but she lies about very minor ridiculous stuff to some pretty major things that can effect peoples lives. The problem is I know her well enough to know that if one person confronts her she will think they are just being "mean" or a bully. If more than one person confronts her she will feel ganged up on and shut down. We have been friends for over 20 years so she is not someone I want to just write off, but it is getting overwhelming and I am almost always upset with her.

Just FYI Forza Horizon was 30 FPS. It's easier to get a game like GT or F5 to run at 60 considering rendering just the track is much less intensive than rendering an open world like in Horizon or NFS Rivals, which both run at 30FPS.  I feel like a lot of people are overlooking that fact but hey, whatever we can do around here to bash on consoles.

My husband is much older than me. I thought he was about 10yrs older than me when we met bc he looks about 10 yrs older than me.  We've been married 5 years and have 2 kids. We have a great relationship. Because of the life I had I am  mentally much "older" than my years and have always been that way. I was forced to be an adult from an early age. He is a kid at heart and somehow it just balances out. This whole, "what would they have in common" thing is just stupid to me. Our friends are the typical 2-5 yr age differences and they rarely have things in common. Usually one plays video games while the other likes to hike. One likes to read while the other likes to watch scary movies. Really I don't think age makes tht much of a difference when it comes to interests. Other things, absolutly. Interest, meh. I'm 28 I play video games, I read, I take care of the kiddos. He works like a mad man. In our down time we watch netflix or he plays solitaire while I read like most couples and if we are blessed with a date night we go to the movies/dinner. I'm blabbing now but the point is, MOST age differences of such drastic-ness ( I made that up :)) are not so good and I understand the skepticism but not ALL relationships of big age differences are just creepy older people trying to prey on the youth of today. It shouldn't immediately be written off. If you are happy, healthy, etc. roll with it.

I remember seeing this I think. Theres a car crash and a few people are filming it. Its not particularly on fire but they are trapped and it is smoking. The flames slowly spread and one or two of the people in there are still alive/conscious but no one tries to help... They just film these people burning. It's rough and one of the few that made me cringe.   If it's that video.
I never have hallucinations when sick, even during my childhood days. This was the only time it happened. I've been sick with higher temps but none like this. when I went to the doc a day after, I even told the doc about my experience. I really thought it was just from my fever but it was after some time that I realized it was too bizarre. I forgot who it was I spoke to who told me that I could have been possessed if I gave in.  Seen? I have my fair share of experiences but on normal occasions, not when I am sick. I can't say that I'm psychic or I see dead people. Like in our house, I've seen a  white figure passing by twice. My brother experienced this also. But this happened at random. I've had other paranormal encounters maybe I'll share someday. It's not as terrifying though. 
I like Gordon. I think he can play the 3. He has the athleticism, length and BBIQ to be an elite defender and is fairly solid on the offensive end. Can work the P&amp;R, he shot fairly well from deep, can finish through contact and and catch and finish in the paint.  Vonley is just too raw. He's one of those guys who will show some flashes in his first 3 years but won't make a case as a starter until possibly his second contract. Gordon, I think, can make an immediate impact. The value proposition is there for Gordon and barring any trades, I think he can play with line-ups of Rondo-Green-Olynyk-Sullinger
I give up.
Many people/cultures are embarrassed to show pain, too. I saw a Norwegian bachelor farmer come in with lawn mower trauma to his lower extremities (leg about chopped off) who insisted he was fine and didn't want any meds.  I once drove from London, ONT to Ann Arbor, MI with chest pain cause I was too embarrassed to stop in Canada or Detroit and tell them I thought I was having a heart attack. (I wasn't).
Maybe...
I always tell myself I won't fuck my ex when she calls randomly wanting sex, but I usually end up doing it. I managed to deny her last time. We'll have to see what happens next time. The sex is just so good though! It's always angry self hatred sex on both parts. Usually we do some freaky shit then we finish and I leave without saying a word cause we both hate each other. I can't keep doing it though.  Before I get a bunch of shit for turning down sex, I'm sure you would too if you went through the bullshit I went through with this girl.

I love her. When my brothers and I were growing up we only had chihuahuas (which at least in my opinion are the worst dogs ever) and having the cocker has been a huge difference.

One thing I read here in reddit was someone saying that didn't want to get a puppy/pet because of you end up loving them and they have a shorter life. Then someone just replied 'Prepare to have the best days of your life' and made me think how fortunate we are that that little life gives us so much happiness. Big cyber hug!

It's nice that you pretend to care about animal cruelty, but still want to eat bacon.
I got dermals because I'd had success with them before and if my body did reject my nape it has lesser scarring. Healed no problem, was very happy. I snagged my left one on a pillow case badly though and it has since rejected but my right is still very happy. I like to think that if I had a barbell I could've lost the whole piercing.   There's not a whole lot of difference without having other dermals or surface piercings on your body to compare with, they both can be long term if you treat it right. I haven't decided if I'll get the left redone or just replace the whole thing with a surface barbell.  The general consensus on this sub is barbell though, because it's been practiced longer and has more solid information. Just a different perspective!   Edit: only major annoyance I've had is hairdressers. They just put your neck straight on the basin to wash and comb without looking. Never had a hairdresser be wary of ear piercings either though 
Your question is incoherent.

You guys are kickass for throwing one of these up. Im seriously planning on building an OKR box soon so if I win you're saving me the trouble. Currently I love my nemmy and KFL+. THANKS!
aw yeah I love petting dogs ears. haha

Thanks for your help.  Your 2nd paragraph has me a bit mixed up. I'm going to try to wade in, tell me where I'm misunderstanding this.  * k=10 outer folds. Inside a given fold we... * do another 5-10 folds to set the regularization parameter * Given that parameter, set the other parameters (slope coefficients, in this case) on the outer fold's training data. *  Get an MSE for that fold on that fold's testing data *  Report the average of MSEs as our overall model MSE  The part that has me hung up: from the outer fold we have 10 models with 10 regularization parameters and 10 sets of coefficients. What do we use as our **final** model? An average of the outer splits??
When you say, "I just deposited money. What the hell." Really you didn't but yoi thought you might have enough in your account for the purchase...
Go there and see for yourself. I stand by my statement.
&gt; What does divide and conquer have to do with any of this?  &gt;&gt;You have to fight back if you want anything to get better. Blacks fought for decades against discrimination, and thanks to that, I lived to see a black man elected president (something I never expected to see). Gays finally had enough and started demanding equality, beginning with the Stonewall riots. Now they enjoy majority support, nationwide.  I suppose I thought too deeply, and so my train of thought leapt ahead. But he was listing groups that were not only shunned, but that they were used as tools to scare people and keep power over others.  &gt;Know what I hate? That fucking stupid song, Waiting for the World to Change.  &gt;&gt;What's your point?  My first thought was "Who taught our generation to be so passive? Have we really been taught to be that submissive and given so much risk (which will be less than the generations before us) that we can't do anything? Why can't we organize and why do we just sit idly, hoping for a future rather than getting it?" I suppose we've been conquered in this respect.  &gt;Just the fact that he has kept a cool head and avoided dragging us into another war despite rabid urging anytime something bad happens somewhere has been the best thing that he could have ever done for this country to promote the future. Up to this point, we were apparently prepared to drown ourselves fighting useless wars around the world  I saw this as another thing. So many people look for so many reasons to hate one man. It's pathetic. I know racial tensions have been worse in America. But I look at things like how Obama is depicted and all of the dog-whistles, slurs and bile-spewing slung his way. It's insane, and Ukraine has brought a lot of that out, again. Which made me think of the Republican party and it's ability to completely decimate the social safety net by simply making 'the other' a boogeyman.  &gt;Is that what you see is happening now in America? In the past?   I do. In the past? That's a more tricky question. I certainly feel that the 70's and 80's were the point where Reganomics needed to be shot down before it got started and Keynesian theory needed to be looked at again. And I feel we've milked 9/11 enough already and should return to normalcy.  Where do you see us now?  &gt;Wealth is becoming concentrated towards the top, as is money. Money seems to buy power now. The people who need to vote aren't voting, which means politicians won't pander to them. People are just desperate enough to do whatever their superiors tell them, but not desperate enough to do anything about it.  I don't live in America right now. I've been in Japan for just over three years. I plan on returning to America in 2 years to get my MsED and it terrifies me beyond reason.

A bit late but whatever =&gt; no he wouldn't have released an earlier version. He made clear that the blueray was what he wanted to do.  Not that it makes much sense to me because the colors are wrong in several places (it's better than the DVD, but still far from perfect), not to mention the stupid changes (again, you would expect they would learn).  Makes you wonder if people actually advised him back then, but on the other hand it's quite obvious that whatever you do gets criticized when you are in a position like George... so I guess he got used to trusting his guts and making stuff the way he wanted.  If he had listened to the studios, the star wars movies would never have existed to begin with. I guess that gives him some credit :)

Disclaimer: this is for western music  Notes are divided up into fractions, the most basic being the whole note, which is equal to two half notes, each half note is equal to two quarter notes, each quarter note is equal to two eighth notes, each eighth is equal to two sixteenths, etc.   We divide music up into measures, sometimes called bars. How many beats there are per bar is called the "Time Signature." It's denoted as a fraction, where the top number is the number of beats per measure, and the bottom is the division of note that gets the beat, for example "4/4" (you would call it 'four-four') would be 4 notes per measure with the Quarter note getting the beat.   Time signature is important because it helps organize the beats into a pattern to construct our rhythm, which I'll get to in a second.   "Tempo" is the same thing as "how fast" a piece of music is. It is measured in beats per minute. Some standard tempos are 120, or "march tempo" which you hear a lot of dance music at, 100 for a "downtempo" feel, a common waltz tempo, 60 for an "adagio" feel, common in a lot of jazz ballads or slow, soft pieces. Rhythm is the "groove" of a piece of music. It is simply the timing of the individual notes within a single measure. It can be described as "on the beat" where notes mostly fall on each individual beat in the measure, or "syncopated" or "off the beat" where the notes are accented on the "up beat" or in between the beats. "On the beat" would be something like a waltz or march, "syncopated" would be something like funk or jazz.   How to find the main beat? tap your foot! Everyone has a sense of rhythm, just start moving to the music and you'll most likely be in time. Tapping your foot to the music is the easiest way to find the beat.  There are a couple really good ways to count. All of them rely on using a single syllable for every beat and subdivision (the parts between the beat).   For a simple 4/4 beat, you count every single beat going "1...2...3...4..." and repeat. You can divide it up into eigth notes and count "1.&amp;.2.&amp;.3.&amp;.4.&amp;." and then again with sixteenth notes going "1 e &amp; a 2 e &amp; a 3 e &amp; a 4 e &amp; a"   Now that's for a "duple" rhythm, where every note evenly divides into halves, or 2 is the smallest subdivision. There is also "triple" meter, where there are three notes per beat, or six, or 9, etc. There are a couple ways to count triplets as they're called   I'm a fan of "1 is a 2 is a 3 is a 4 is a" but some like "tri pl et" because it makes sense.   There is also an Indian system of counting that is more intuitive and doesn't use numbers, but syllables corresponding to different hits on a tabla (a kind of drum). I don't know them all but instead of "1 2 3 4" you can go "ta ka ta ka" and instead of "1 is a" for triplets, you can go "ta ka ni" and for eigths "taka taka taka taka" and sixteenths "takatini."  For quintuplets and sextouplets, which you probably won't hear in most music I personally just use "hippopotamus" and "necrobeastiality"

When people say that I try and look past the unnecessary sarcasm and think about what it really means. I believe you really mean there should be no minimum wage and any number you set is just arbitrary more or less. Those of us who believe in a minimum wage a lot of times believe that it is important to have because it stops company's that are dependent on wage subsidies.  If you want to do business in an area that provides you services like roads and police protection then you need to offer a wage that doesn't require your employees all be done government assistance.

I'm going to go ahead and throw in the check the side bar for the DO's and DON'Ts as it has amazing information for each category.  Let's start with the first two sections. You should fill them out... Talk more about yourself and I probably wouldn't say you're into nerdy things. You can say some of the things you're into and let the reader decide if it's nerdy or not. But this is the category for talking about who you are not what you like/do.  Talk more about what you're doing with your life besides what you do for work. It's a good spot for talking about your hobbies or whatever it is your passionate about. This is the category for talking about what you like/do.

There seems to be a continuity from the war against non-conforming Muslim states (Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Egypt under Morsi...) to new targets for the US war machine. The long war is becoming the EndlessWar, which happens to be the name of this subreddit.   I will confer with my associate about modifying the sidebar.

Well, seeing as these specific companies stand to benefit from net neutrality, its no surprise really.   Netflix does NOT want ISP's to be able to throttle Netflix's streaming services if netflix doesn't cough up more cash.  Google also doesn't want ISP's to be able to have that kind of power over the internet because a huge portion of google's revenue comes from its advertisements and data collecting/selling to advertisers.

We didn't sleep train. They just eventually started sleeping through the night.  ...except when teething, or sick, or they poop BUT sleep training doesn't stop those wakings from happening.

This is the most correct answer.

I never knew that was an argument
For all elements A, B, C in some Set X, the relationship A to B and B to C imply the existence of the relationship A to C.  Let a, b, and c, be the cards Dark Confidant, Boom//Bust, and Counterbalance respectively.  Let the relationship R in question be the question "Is an element of the first set a member of the second set".  aRb, that is the question "is Dark Confidant CMC equal to one of the CMCs of Boom//Bust?" and there exists an answer, it is defined, the answer is True.  bRc, that is the question "does one of Boom//Bust CMCs equal to CMC of Counterbalance?" and there again exists an answer, it is defined, the answer is True.  This would imply that aRc is defined, and is true.  So, the question now, is it?  Yes.  The CMC of Dark Confidant and Counterbalance are equal to one another.  To show that the transitive property does not hold, you would need to compare to a card with CMC 6.  Let d be Interpret the Signs, and all other values the same as before.  Should the transitive property hold then the relationship (aRb &amp; bRd) imply aRd.  So does this hold?  We already know aRb is true.  What about bRd?  The CMC of Boom/Bust contains 6, and the CMC of Interpret the Signs is 6.  So that is true.  However aRd is false.  And thus the property does not hold.  I asked you about it, not because I did not understand it.  But because you did a bait and switch on the relationship R.  &gt; Counterbalance says "counter a spell if its CMC equals Boom//Bust's CMC", so if transitivity of equality holds I can counter a spell if its CMC = Boom//Bust's CMC = 8, but I can't, because equals doesn't mean equals.  Not really?  Because like I said above this relationship here is not the same relationship as the one above.  Dark Confident is not asking the same question as Counterbalance, and thus not the same relationship.  Ergo you cannot determine if the transitive property holds from your example alone.  You happen to be correct about it for some definitions of R, but not all, and not for how your trying to show it.  &gt; I don't find it intuitive at all that "equal to the CMC" of a card sometimes means "find all the CMCs of the card and add them up" and other times means "pick one of the CMCs and use that", and I don't know what the criteria is for deciding which one a card is supposed to use (clearly it's not whether we're comparing things or not, since Dark Confidant is comparing life lost to the CMC).  Again, because you are incorrectly conflating the questions being asked.  I looked at your posting history, you have posted to /r/programming so I will just take guess that perhaps you might know a little bit about programming and pseudocode.  Firstly, let all cards be defined by a set of properties, one of them being a Unique Id to all cards.  These properties in question include an entry for CMC.  CMC is also a set, it must contain non-negative whole values, and must contain at least 1 value.  CMC may contain many values.  Dark confident does the following.   Flip a card C  select CMC from C  foreach int N in CMC   lose life equal to N  Place C in hand  This is why its just the summation.  You are doing something in a loop, and those values add up.  The number of times you pass though the loop is based on the size of the set CMC in C.  &gt; Put yet another way, if I lose life equal to the CMC of Boom//Bust, the answer to the question "Did I just lose life equal to the CMC of Boom//Bust" should be yes, but it is not.  Because this is a type error!  CMC isn't a value, its a set of values, at least that is how it is treated.  Lets compare this to Counterbalance.  I will define a helper function to evaluate the truth statement.   Let boolean helper(int N, set of int CMC)   if CMC is empty return false   select a value from CMC, and remove from set, place in int V   return (N==V)|helper(N, CMC)  Now for Counterbalance.   Get the CMC of a card k on the stack. --because split cards on the stack only have one CMC, we never need to worry about a set at this stage.  Flip a card c.  if helper(k.CMC, select CMC from C) counter k   To address  &gt;  "find all the CMCs of the card and add them up" and other times means "pick one of the CMCs and use that"  It doesn't do that.  This is why I keep saying you're thinking about it wrong.  &gt;  I don't know what the criteria is for deciding which one a card is supposed to use (clearly it's not whether we're comparing things or not, since Dark Confidant is comparing life lost to the CMC).  So, Dark Confidant is not comparing anything.  It performs its operations for all valid values.  If you pass in [Who/What/When/Where/Why](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74358) or if you pass in no card because you have no cards left in your library.  For each value, it performs its action.  Counterbalance is comparing something.  When something is compared, if any answer works, then it works.  In effect, you can treat it as a single bit with no overflow you are summing over.  &gt;&gt; 708.6a An effect that performs a positive comparison (such as asking if a card is red) or a relative comparison (such as asking if a card’s converted mana cost is less than 2) involving characteristics of one or more split cards in any zone other than the stack gets only one answer. This answer is “yes” if either side of each split card in the comparison would return a “yes” answer if compared individually.  Counterbalance asks a different question than Dark Confidant.  Counterbalance asks, does this cards CMC equal a value.  If any of the cards CMCs are equal to that value, then its true.  Else its false.   **TL;DR:**  Nothing to do with the existence of the transitive property, because you are not using the same relationships.  You perform the operation over the set of characteristics, and then sum the result.... umm... there are some code examples to look at.
Yeah I have no idea why I did that.  I messed up.
No that's the context. They didn't say 'is a marriage only between a man and a woman?' If they did you would have a justification for stating that jesus said gay marriages were invalid. He did not and your assertion that this is the case is intellectually disingenuous.

I work with kids. I like kids.  I don't want any, especially right now, but they're cute, funny, and out to make you miserable sometimes.

Kids are kids though.
