The answer to the "why are manhole covers round" asinine interview question is that a round cover can't fall into the hole no matter the orientation.  I have no idea why interviewers ask this.
The midterm I hated the most was one from linear algebra. Basically every question was 3 or 4 statements, and the possible answers were...  a) I and II are true  b) I and III are true  c) II and III are true  d) All are true  e) None are true
Hmmm, my subtle humor appears to have been ineffective.

I'm sorry not to sound racist or anything, but why is it that Asians are only friends with Asians? :3. I want to be friends with some, but I feel threatened by their group!

Yes I dated a guy with a huge wiener for 5 years, and I was even smaller than you! I tried to just live with it. Usually the pain lasts for a minute or two but then after that it gets better. For me, it was better with him on top, which sadly, guys normally don't like. Just take it slow once it's in, and let him know how you feel.
The fast kind.

Except they aren't. The Japanese did it in WW2, and they weren't religious. They did it because they were commanded to. Pride for their country and their emperor was the tool there, not religion.  Nobody suicides simply because of their religion. Religion might be the tool used sometimes, but nobody suicides simply because of their beliefs (Which is what the post seemed to imply.)  Edit: to expand on that - religion might be the tool, but it still isn't for their beliefs that they are suicide bombing. 9/11 as a big example, happened for more political reasons than religious. Sure the guys who actually did it would have been spoonfed a lot of crap about religion to make it happen, but who's to say it couldn't have happened without religion? Suicide bombing has happened before without religion, that's for sure.
Those cymbals sound amazing.

My guess lately is that Zetsu was created by Orochimaru, who got the Hashirama DNA from the real Madara.  I'm pretty sure that before the real Madara died he was working with Orochimaru in his Hashirama DNA experiments.
I did hear a "Fuck, Whoppers suck."  Now admittedly, they do, but come on 10 year old kid, give me a break. 
(Foreword: I'm Theist)  I was raised in Church(sunday school and all), but I'm feeling more and more that teaching them ideas, and going so far as telling them "believe this or hell for you" is brainwashing. They're kids, they're impressionable. You can tell them anything and they'll believe it. It's not Faith if you don't give them the other side of the argument.  I get a sick feeling in my stomach when people mention the prayers of children and their pure belief in whatnot ... they're that way because it's been smashed into their brains every Sunday. No one tells them there are other beliefs and educates them about the other religions as much as they do Christianity.  Go ahead, other Christians. Give me an argument that says Sunday school isn't basically brainwashing.

Most employers won't say anything in regards to that.  In fact, a lot of employers have a policy to just say that you worked there and when. No one cares what your termination memo says, it's not a government document or anything.  It's just some paper they gave you.

rule 34. i'm searching this shit up.
This article fails to mention the drastic reduction in federal public works spending in 1937, which Keynesians consider to be at least as important as the tax increases in causing the 1937 downturn. The fact that the author is familiar with how much federal spending expanded from 1933 to 1936 makes me suspect that he is aware that public works spending was slashed  in 1937 and intentionally neglects that argument rather than attempting to answer it.  If this is the case, he's being pretty intellectually dishonest.
I know I'll be downvoted to hell for saying this, but the answer is nothing.  Absolutely nothing.

I'm saying that many of the various Societies for Imaginary Beings could provide a hell of a lot of help to OWS. You don't have to think their spiritual beliefs are reasonable; the only "belief" relevant in this is the religious duty to fight injustice, especially the exploitation of the poor. You don't have to agree with them in all things, to make common cause together.  Churches aren't just collections of beliefs. They're also large, interconnected communities of people. Religious leaders are community leaders, people trusted and respected especially on ethical matters. People who would normally dismiss protesters will reconsider if their rabbi is among the people getting arrested. A priest defending OWS can reach people who would never listen to us.   And churches are institutions with the infrastructure needed to communicate information, motivate and organize large groups of people under common cause, organize transportation and supplies and services, and do it all from a position that is *very* hard for the government to discredit or interfere with. Freeze an activist's accounts because you don't like what they're saying and no one knows about it but their followers; freeze the state bishop's accounts and all hell would break loose.  We're not talking about making OWS a religious event, we're talking about appealing to the tradition of progressive advocacy and defense of social justice, to find common cause and encourage people to join.

We can't jump straight from global warming -&gt; raising sea levels. If man isn't causing the warming (or is causing a small fraction of it) then there may not be able to do much about it despite wishes to the contrary.  Secondly, warming temperatures may lower sea levels. Increased evaporation could lead to increased snow fall in the arctic and antarctic regions which will remain well below freezing.  Lastly, while you might have to build taller and stronger dikes, other places could see their harbors getting deeper thus allowing cheaper transportation.

EXACTLY. Story time: been going out with the girlfriend for about 3 months, pretty clingy, but manageable. I mentioned i was going skiing with my friends, she thinks its an invite and decides to come which is fine, i dont care.   The entire day consisted of her acting weird and not talking to me... then she cried the entire ride home because I "didnt treat her like my girlfriend" we broke up 2 weeks later
Yay Scotland. I don't follow that closely, but is Scotland actually considering becoming independent? Or is it more of a minority thing that doesn't have much of a chance in the short term? I have a lot of Scottish heritage, I need to make it there at there some point! On a side note, I didn't realize until a few weeks ago how low the population of Scotland is, not a dig or anything, I was just genuinely surprised.

Off the cuff.  Of course I have a bit of experience in the area.  I enjoy off the cuff erotic writing, especially when I have a specific receptive female I'm writing to/about. I like to show off my imagination, and I get off on the idea of her enjoying my words and making my thoughts real.
(also XY) I think it's more than a vocal minority. This is quite probably in tandem with [confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias). When a misogynic phase is uttered, it is presumed that the speaker is male. This is obviously due to the nonsensicality (or unlikeliness) of someone deriding their own gender.   Now, as you see, here we have both posted 'XY' in these threads, because it may be ambiguous as to which gender is posting, and we wanted to be clear. This isn't really necessary, and i don't think it would be presumptuous if many, many males did not post that they are males  when making non-sexist comments in this subreddit or others. This would cause any normal person's brain to ascribe all the sexist comments to male redditors, yet under-represent the non-sexist comments from men.   tl;dr: the kids are (very probably) alright

What were the implications for the Republic or Ireland with continuance of IRA activities in Nth Ireland and the UK, specifically in the 50's and then the troubles. Obviously IRA members weren't officially sheltered by the Republic, but there was cross border activity and such.  Would it not be a similar situation for Palestine? Whatever authority is leading Palestine at the time must make every effort to stop attacks and prosecute perpetrators?

Hi, I moved the PST and all it seemed to do was copy the inbox and sent items folders.  The pc was hit by a virus before I backed up the hard drive, so it's possible that the info is no longer there, but if it is then it would be nice to be able to extract it from my backup files somehow. :)
A problem is that I can't have both of my hard drives, and my cd-drive hooked up at the same time.
An excellent point.  It would be more limited than fire on command, and cannot have the same level of temperature control, but it *might* be used in such a fashion.

How do you become "good" at programming? Do you just read books and code anything you can? When it comes to your career as a programmer, is it true that people with CS degrees are now referred to as "Software Engineers"?

One thing I don't understand about halloween is why would people want to dress their children up in scary outfits (like witches and zombies) and take them to "haunted" houses and such and scare the crap out of them, put ideas in their head, and then complain that their kids have nightmares and scary thoughts and such things. Well duh! You did it to them yourself!
Good point, I'm 25 with no wife/kids and a job where I can live anywhere, so it's *far* easier for me to move than most.  But not all the parents there want to forcefeed that tripe to their kids. Some would move or form political opposition to far-right laws, stopping them from passing in their state.  Perfectly true that this is far from a perfect solution, but it might let more people get their political preference while avoiding having a divisive issue on the national stage, and avoiding hicks pushing their beliefs on states like New Jersey or whatever.
Yup! It takes me at most 20 minutes to get to work but I leave 45 min early in case of traffic, stopping for coffee, etc. I like to be there early to settle in. Same thing with visiting friends.

He wasn't always like this. It got worse and worse since his father died and he had to deal with his mom more without a buffer there. Its really just started becoming a problem over this last year and its maybe only once a month or so. When he is in a good mood its great, he and I are (to be cliche) two peas in a pod... a weird mutated pod that most growers would toss off to the side but one pod none-the-less. He is supportive to me and honest with me almost to the point where my friends are like... "If you ask him if you're getting pudgy he shouldn't tell you that you are." What they don't realize is that I prefer this, also he doesn't just say, "Yep, you're getting fat." He says, "Well you have gained some weight but its because we don't get to eat as healthy as much... and you're still really hot. Maybe we should go running." He just isn't open and honest about himself... he wont tell me what he is feeling no matter how petty or small the issue is. He lets it all build to the point where he has a bunch of little things to be irritated at then lets them all out at once. 
Since it's a gift exchange I'm guessing that Funny &gt; Expensive.

&gt;When you're as big as Google and trying to get things right, you shouldn't keep legacy things around.  Legacy was a bad term. What I meant is: Go ahead and integrate Reader and Plus, but don't cripple reader in the process.  &gt; But I'm still not sure I understand. If you want to share news with people, why not join Google+? Do you not like it for some reason?   I used to follow around 50 people on Reader, none of these people use Plus nor they intend to.  The reasons vary: The already have Facebook, privacy concerns, the fact that you have to provide your real information... You name it.  So in my case, instead of Google gaining 50 Plus users, they'ree losing 50 Reader users (I don't know if I'm the norm, but that's my case)

You missed that on the linked page:  &gt; A true series hybrid vehicle would need a whopping big generator, something along the lines of a 30-40,000 watt unit to produce sufficient current to drive the car, have peak power for hill climbing and passing, and to make up for the losses incurred when changing energy from chemical to heat, then to mechanical, then to electrical, sending it forward to the EV, controlling the current, converting it back into mechanical energy, and then sending it to the road to drive the car forward.

I would take that bet, but we won't be speaking in 20 years so I couldn't collect. Though, I must ask this, what does it matter is most young people are black or of arabic descent? You're treading dangerously close to outright racism, here.  Very few of the Muslims that are already here (UK for me) actually want anything like the societies they left behind, and not all of the kids of immigrants stay in their parents religion, and of those who do many do so only in the same sense that many Christians in the UK do so. There will be no majority demanding an Islamic state in 20 years, or 50, or 100.   &gt; You didn't explain to me the rule of war of the Qu'raan! I can't compare.

Yeah that is how things work out currently with me and my SO. I am truthful about everything and I expect he's truthful about how he feels. If we feel bothered by something we talk it out we try and figure out what made us feel that way in the first place and so far we have been able to sort out our problems. If I ever feel I can't tell him anything then I know its a problem and problems won't solve themselves they'll just fester into other issues.  I just expect the other person to be reasonable.   I just expect us to be adults.

You're welcome to stay on your high-horse for as long as you'd like, but realize you won't be able to sway people to your viewpoint... a viewpoint which coincidentally we happen to share, I just think you need to learn to communicate better, and you need to lose the ego... so to that end I am more than happy to wind your dumb ass up. :)  You're right, I am choosing to read it, and I am choosing to point out how absolutely awful you are at the thing you're seemingly setting out to do... assuming your goal is to change minds and not just to make yourself look like an immature, self-righteous egoist.

The goal of the Occupy Wallstreet movement isn't to make confrontation/conflict with the cops. Our goal is to raise awareness of socioeconomic inequality, The influence and control of government by corporations and wealthily, and to the reform of campaign fiance laws.  Calling cops pigs and picking fights, it goes both ways, isn't going to help. Wining the hearts and minds of the people will. Many cops share out goals and unfortunately have to do the bidding of their bosses.

Nothing to do with the immigration policy. They're nation-states: states who are ruled by, and defined by, a specific nation (aka "people" or "ethnic group"). I don't think it's racist either. You were the one implying that it is.

I build crappy computers out of them and add them to my network. Mostly I just use them to store movies on, since they all have 40gb-80gb hard drives. And they are handy when my main computer has a catastrophic failure, I at least have computers that can watch movies and browse Reddit until the parts come in for the beast. Also if guests want to get online I don't have to let them get on my main box.
im glad you enjoy them, that was the hope of this post :). but i also never said that this subreddit needs to be changed, just wanted to make sure people have that clear.

I feel like everyone forgets about how well we played against Dallas, too. Dallas has a high powered offense. Romo may blow the big one sometimes, but he's a good qb and he has weapons in Miles Austin, Jason Witten, and Dez Bryant. Yeah the defense didn't play amazingly last night but there is hope. It's one game. They'll learn from it. They'll bounce back. 
i hate you
&gt;On the contrary, you must have faith that there are no unicorns, fairies, leprechauns, or bigfoot. Nobody has ever proven they don't exist,  Ah, so now, we come to the crux of the issue. Who holds the burden of proof for the existence of god? I don't have to prove that leprechauns don't exist, do I?  &gt;I bet you just assumed that because everyone else around you believes that.  No, I assumed it because rainbows are a function of the visible light spectrum refracting through water, not a trail that leads to a pot of gold.  I've never personally witnessed an electron moving through metal, does that mean it doesn't happen?  &gt;A-Theist means without God, which means that an Atheist has come to a conclusion on the unprovable question of whether of not God exists.  This, I agree with. However,  &gt;Since neither conclusion is provable, both conclusions require a certain amount of faith if you believe them.  It takes no faith to not believe in something. I don't think god is nonexistent, I simply remain unconvinced of his existence.  &gt;What you are calling agnostic atheism looks like simple agnosticism to me  You can define it however you want, You could call a car an airplane if you wanted. That doesn't change what the word actually means, however.  &gt;Gnostic - Of or relating to knowledge, esp. esoteric mystical knowledge.  &gt;Agnostic - A person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena  You could be agnostic and still be a theist, you could simply agree that 'nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena'

I didn't get all the hype about it.  It felt disjointed to me.  Like "here is the puzzle level, now time for the chase level, look another puzzle level".

Lots of unique levels and for the most part it seems technically well done.  Great graphics, funny dialogue ect.  But there is just something lacking from it for me.  
Thanks for your advice.  That was very helpful.  I guess I will keep looking as I don't want to overpay.
I played the beta at blizzcon and I am pretty sure that it was not removed.
I read that even if they would have won, they still wouldn't have made the playoffs (they needed a team to lose later, who didn't).  Makes the PAT not seem so bad.
IdrA said in the TL thread he hasn't yet been paid for IPL1 and Joshy said they had paid most of the players from IPL2 &amp; all from IPL1 and are looking into why IdrA hasn't been paid. 
That wallpaper is a mess in both pictures!
This is why I've planned it out so that, should anybody decide to get me involved in such an asinine and pointless war, would get a rather stern talking to and a very angry letter from a rebellious Canadian friend I know.
I disagree. An elite RB can get you some wins (See: Gore, Frank since 2005) but an elite RB cannot get you a winning record.  But if you have the rest of the pieces in place and have an elite running back... shit gets good.
That is truly one of the sweetest things that I have ever seen!
These two guys just karma-fited off the same goddamn picture which is almost like double-posting.  Goddamn epic marbles you two.  Two front-pages in a row for what is arguably the pre-pedobear.

When people ask me why I didn't show up to their party I tell them that I did, I was a ninja.  No one spotted me.
Oh I see - well, innumerable sources and journalists (Anderson Cooper for one) have questioned him on his atheism since he got cancer. Many are (maybe falsely or inappropriately) asking whether he's sticking to his guns about there being no God - at any rate, he seems to be, and is quite open about it.
 **[AMA Weekly](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=279255)**** presents Scott "SirScoots" Smith.** *[Promo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZgJoyWjXQI&amp;feature=player_embedded)*  *Please support our threads in [/r/Gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/lvtcc/professional_gaming_team_manager_of_evil_geniuses/) and [/r/Starcraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/lvlww/when_this_post_is_3_hours_old_sir_scoots_will_be/).* _____________ **Life as Scoots**  In the primordial soup that was western eSports, [Scott "SirScoots" Smith](http://twitter.com/#!/SirScoots) discovered professional gaming in the era of trite server sponsorships for hardcore Counter Strike players. The event logistics coordinator took his production talents and dropped it into the eSports soup to evolve the standard for competitive gaming production in the early ages of online streaming. Mr. Smith spent many years at GotFrag and then at MLG after GotFrag was aquired by the league.  Eventually he was asked to relocate and decided to move on to other ventures.  Seizing the opportunity [Alex Garfield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-bpaNgOOg), the current CEO of [Evil Geniuses](http://myeg.net/team/), picked up Sir Scoots as COO for his multi-platform competitive gaming organization. What would come from the wicked pair can only be described as the world's most established western eSports team. Although newer to the Starcraft Scene, EG's players are constantly in either the entertainment or tournament championship spotlight.   Today SirScoots can be seen weekly as a co-host on the long running [Live on Three](http://onemoregame.tv/index.php/shows/lo3.html) talkshow, part of the [OneMoreGame TV](http://onemoregame.tv/) media company where he holds his second COO title. Scoots can also be seen as a spectator, interviewee, and team supporter at almost all western eSports events. _________ **Short Question Short Answer**  Answers by AMA Host:[SirScoots](http://www.reddit.com/user/SirScoots)   *Questions and answers may been shortened. Posts without a wrapup question may be paraphrased.*  Last Updated: Thread is 5 hour old. 155 Questions.  Q:[Can you get Idra to sing a duet with Cella when he goes to Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzivv?context=3) &gt;I will ask him, but he is not contractually obligated to sing.  Q:[What did you think of the whole Milkis thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzjs6?context=3) &gt;I actually have not paid much attention to it this week, as I was prepping for the EGMCS stream.  Q:[Do you think Slasher's hair was short enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzk4e?context=3) &gt;Since the bet was "shave his head" I would say no. :)  Q:[What does the next year of eSports mean for the growth of the whole scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzmsk?context=3) &gt;I think 2012 is poised to be a huge growth year for the scene. I would think SC2 continues to grow for one. Add to that DotA2, CS:GO (crosses fingers) and some other titles and we could see some other areas really start to grow again as well.   Q:[Can you give us information on the salary HuK agreed to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vznbl?context=3) &gt;He does in fact have a salary. ;)   Q:[You've been in e-Sports for a long time, is this something you see yourself doing until retirement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vznup?context=3) &gt;Pro gaming is something I hope to be involved with until I retire to some remote island or die.  Q:[What has been your most memorable moment with team EG so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzp8q?context=3) &gt;WCG China with our various players...amazing event! Justin Fucking Wong! Being at Blizzcon when Grubby proposed to Cass...in his jersey! ;) Hugging my best bud Alex Garfield when HuK won MLG!  Q:[Things have been dark on the news front with demuslim. What is coming up for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzpyy?context=3) &gt;As everyone knows DeMusliM is back home taking care of paperwork. Hopefully MLG, maybe a few other events, and as previously talked about in news, some time in Korea!  Q:[Can you please inform us about LZ? Like I know he's still in EG but you rarely hear about him. Is EG bitter at him for switching from T to Z? Any plans to move him over to AZ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzqvv?context=3) &gt;No one is bitter at him for switching back to the race he played in BW. :) LZ has some attachments to the area of the US he lives in, so that is why he does not live at the lair. He has and will come out from time to time and train with the rest of the guys.  Q:[With the recent drama over tournament winnings in SC2, what role do you and EG play in making sure players get properly compensated? Any insight on how other teams might do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzser?context=3) &gt;Unfortunately, players not getting their prize money is nothing new to pro gaming. :( We tend to represent our players when coordinating attendance at events etc, so that also means we assist in communications and paperwork when it is time for our players to receive prize money. I imagine most larger teams operate in the same capacity.  Q:[What is your opinion on tournaments organizers paying the players extremely late and what you would do to reduce the time it takes for players to get paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzttf?context=3) &gt;I think 30 days is a perfect and standard window of time to receive payment in the real world, and it should be the same here. One way to speed up the process would be to take all player paperwork from every player as part of registration process. No need chasing the winners down online after they have left your event if they could not even participate without the docs. :)  Q:[Will we be seeing the EG players that are going to Korea in the GSTL under the EG banner or an EG/SlayerS union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vztzr?context=3) &gt;Colin is hard at work on that announcement... ;)  Q:[We met at Orlando, I was collecting signatures for the MLG Orlando /r/starcraft poster charity auction. I have an even bigger charity idea in the works. Were can I contact you to inquire if you//EG could help me out and help make this even more amazing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzu3p?context=3) &gt;Drop me a private message here?  Q:[What do you think will allow for CS to come back from the dead or will it just be dead for good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzuwy?context=3) &gt;1)A decent starting version of CS:GO  &gt;2)A listening and adjusting Valve  &gt;3)A supportive hardcore (1.6 and CSS)  &gt;4)A shitload of new gamers trying it and seeing what I saw years ago  &gt;5)A solid level of major events and leagues using it   &gt;6)UGP :)  Q:[What do you actually do on a daily basis for EG? Give me a day in the life of sir scoots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzycq?context=3) &gt;I get up around seven Get outta bed around nine And I don't worry about nothin' no 'Cause worrin's a waste of my... time The show usually starts around seven We go on stage around nine Get on the bus about eleven Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine :) I spend my days working on both EG and OMG duties. So if I am not at an event, I am generally dealing with any issues that arise, shipping stuff out or visiting the lair, helping produce the OMG shows, EGMC casts, tips/tricks etc, watching various streams and such of our players and events, and usually capped off with some gaming!  Q:[You've been in Esports for a long time. Where do you truly see Esports going in the next year and do you see more opportunity for professional gaming now than you did when Counterstrike was at its peak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzyzm?context=3) &gt;I see professional gaming as something that will continue to grow for sure. As I said prior, current popular games growing more + new games will make for a great growth year. I see a much larger fanbase that ever before, so that alone makes for more opportunity than back when CS peaked.  Q:[I used to follow PysionicReaver and then some drama shit happened and he left. Could you clarify on what happened? Also I know that EG has plans of going into Dota2 (it was announced I believe) any major stuff planned or still in the works and confidential?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzznf?context=3) &gt;No idea what happened with him. He decided to make up some stories and then disappear. Bye? We have announced our new team and I guess one of the major things planned for them is to train in China. :)  Q:[What do you do if there is a giant in your house that won't leave who wants to steal your cat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w000q?context=3) &gt;The bigger they are, the harder they fall! I have a [swordcane!](http://i.imgur.com/FhZpv.png)  Q:[Are there plans to expand the EG House and your guys' dedicated training facilities to more than your sc2 division?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w00h9?context=3) &gt;The house has already been used by our WoW team to bootcamp before Blizzcon and we will continue to use it for other divisions when it makes sense to do so.  Q:[Moba games are very popular in china, do you see china opening up to the western scene in the next year? and if so do you think moba games will become more popular than starcraft 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w00rj?context=3) &gt;They are already hugely popular in many areas, not just China. We are sending our team to China, so they better open up quick because Evil is coming! ;)  Q:[Where do you see E-Sports in 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w01ju?context=3) &gt;One year at a time! If anything, I see it still growing and with far more mainstream support than currently!   Q:[If you had an annual budget of $10 million for your own personal esports expenditures, what would be your top 3 things you would spend it on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w02ey?context=3) &gt;hmm...that's a tough one to do quickly!  &gt;I would buy some TV production trucks MNF style for one! After that would require real thought to figure out the best way to spend that kind of money.   Q:[What is your favorite video game of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w030v?context=3)  [What is your favorite starcraft unit?

Q:[What did you do before you became involved in professional gaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w037w?context=3) &gt;My career is in event planning and onsite event logistics.  Q:[How much is idra's and huk's salary??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w03dt?context=3) &gt;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
i would play more games with bots. I only started playing humans after i started beating bots consistently. 
Do you have trouble believing that there are other earth-like planets in the universe? Also, their heaven is actually split up into 3 worlds.  One very similar to earth and 2 higher planets (kingdoms).  
Tan that chest, sailor!
&gt; anyone who is against animal testing is not only stupid but maliciously so.  That's why they're too stupid to function. They haven't gotten past, "hurting animals makes me sad." If you ask them what should we test on, you get a blank stare. I don't think it's malicious so much as they haven't considered the consequences of their beliefs, but who does these days? It's like when I'm talking to Christians and they explain that Jesus is about love and if you love him you get into heaven. If you look at it from this angle, it's not malicious, it's just stupid. They haven't gotten as far as, "but what if you don't accept Jesus but live a good life and are very spiritual?" Well we know the answer is well you go to hell of course, but then you see them look really uncomfortable about that realization. Now Christianity appears maliciously stupid. But I feel that you have to be conscious of how your actions harm others before you can be called "malicious."
I had an idea of what it was due to the Malthusian Belt from *Brave New World.*

Hyperbole and a half !!!! :D
Sure, for Dominion.  Scaling happens in a significantly different fashion in SR, because depending on what lane you are in, and how many kills/cs you are getting, you can have a significantly different amount of gold and level than everyone else.  In Dominion, you're typically all the same level with about the same amount of gold, so people are building up high end items at the same time. This results in significantly more defense/offense than one would typically expect. This is particularly notable and problematic for AP carries, who typically have a bit of a level advantage on much of hte opposing team in SR.
Seriously, MDMA is the ultimate social anxiety medicine.

Well Fluttershy is the soft spoken shy adorable one of the group. She cares for little woodland critters (not to be confused with Christmas critters). I personally would want to hug them all, but I think she reminds people of a cute little puppy that is adorable regardless of what she does. 
What's your favorite setup? what setup gets you the most points? what one tip helped you get all teh unlocks? how do all-unlocked choppers stand up to all-unlocked jets?
I would, too. Damn that looks like fun.
In America trying to take away someone's guns or remove the 10 commandments from a courthouse is unconscionable but its perfectly okay to try to police other people's bedrooms- I don't get it either. 
My best bet would be hold a battery in(with the lid open) for long enough that it gets the screen pretty hot, but not hot enough to combust the kief( if there's that much in there) Then quickly remove the battery and go at it with brush it came with. Should work, if not, when it's hot, try to scrape it EVER SO GENTLY with a little flat tip or something. Should be fine, It happens to everyone at some point
Hey there ahg1177. I can't imagine the challenges you face in your life or the difficulties you have to deal with. I know that the Catholic Church's position is not one you are likely to desire, but I will mention a view here that may help you since you ask about reconcilliation.  From the Catholic Church's perspective, having homosexual tendencies or urges is not sinful on its own. Homosexual sexual acts are the sins. So the best answer I have heard on the matter here that resolves some of the challenges is to seek reconciliation if you have had sex and choose to be celibate:  &gt; **1 Cor 7:8** - *Now to the unmarried and to widows, I say: it is a good thing for them to remain as they are, as I do*  Celibacy in service of God is a calling to all people. It is a more difficult path but one that has its own rewards and St. Paul calls us all to follow if we can.  I hope you can find an answer that will resolve the dilemma for you.

The goal of the Occupy Wallstreet movement isn't to make confrontation/conflict with the cops. Our goal is to raise awareness of socioeconomic inequality, The influence and control of government by corporations and wealthily, and to the reform of campaign fiance laws.  Calling cops pigs and picking fights, it goes both ways, isn't going to help. Wining the hearts and minds of the people will. Many cops share out goals and unfortunately have to do the bidding of their bosses.
I'm a little disappointed. I thought you were a god with photoshop
Not saying I don't want him. Did you read the article? I'm just saying if in 4 or something years if he's scoring 30-40 points playing as a third line checker, would he be worth 6 million?
As others have said, this is all on your landlord. He/She needs to get the land surveyed- also if she has had the land surveyed bringing up the paperwork shouldn't be complicated. Also, that was foolish of her to make such great changes to the property with a possible gas and/or water line a few feet under the surface, in some counties you can get a major fine for that. 
That's basically the definition of a cult film.
Thank you.  Bad enough that Reddit is filled with grammar nazis...the last thing we need is topic nazis.
Fair enough.

Well done. It's painful reading some of the stories on /r/trees, people wouldn't get busted nearly as much if they knew their rights.

It's also because its much more difficult to automate than colour or something.

What Sonnen says is true though: champs get called out. not the other way around. this is why i love diaz right now for calling out gsp. make the champs work!!
So what alternative do you suggest? I for one am not okay with the amount of influence money, via lobbying and political contributions, has on our government. I'm sick of Bankers and b/millionaire business men populating every seat of importance in the president's cabinet, the senate, and the entire government. Becoming a politician has become a great business move, not a way of representing the people's interest. What should we do instead?
So - first thing, I went to the steam forum page you listed. The first tip says to go to C:\Users\[profile name]\AppData\Local\THQ\Saints Row 2\settings.dat - and edit the settings.dat file. There is NOTHING in the Saints Row 2 folder. Nothing.   Maybe a steam restart and a computer reboot are in order to start with?  Ugh.
Thanks! (shameless self promotion alert) Vote for it so it gets printed! 
AWWWWWWWW :3 Looks like one of my cats when she was younger &lt;3
I'm sorry but you're stating incorrect facts.  * The average game player is 37 years old and has been playing games for 12 years. * The average age of the most frequent game purchaser is 41 years old. * Forty-two percent of all game players are women. In fact, women over the age of 18 represent a significantly greater portion of the game-playing population (37 percent) than boys age 17 or younger (13 percent). * In 2011, 29 percent of Americans over the age of 50 play video games, an increase from nine percent in 1999. * http://www.theesa.com/facts/index.asp  There is a market for games targeted at adults and not just kids.

True... but either way I think WCG letting both Dig and CDE go to korea would go a long way towards patching up their sullied rep.
That's another one of my favourites. I always thought it was Jamerson, though.
I must concede this point in that, as you say, we may one day figure out exactly how a human being reacts to all situations. But I would proffer that on that day, we will stop being human beings.

You mean Chemical Engineering (ChE)? I usually see CE as the abbreviation for computer engineers.
It's simply not that simple. A lot of the technologies for renewable energy sources like windmills and solars require rare earth elements, which come along with a lot of environmental concerns themselves. I'm not 100% up to date on the details but from what I know, it often requires strip mining and produces radioactive waste.
Yeah but on the custom: it doesn't currently require gateway so you can just go plant your 9 pylon and an assim and gg 2 min game.  I'm sure it'll get fixed soon.

All boxed Skyrim copies will have a map.  The "first run / Preorder copies" will have the premium "cloth-like" paper map.  (So 1st day store copies may also have this ... I don't if there's some indication on the box.)  All additional shipments will have a normal paper map.
"but that this does not rule out a creator"  Nor does it rule IN a creator.   It doesn't rule out Darth Vader being true, or pixies existing at the bottom of my yard.   It doesn't rule out Thor, Odin, Zeus, Saturn or indeed hobbits either.  When you have overwhelming lack of evidence, and a known predilection to ascribe that which we do not understand to a mythical being, it's time to challenge your way of thought.   And in the name of the great man himself, your God is just an ever shrinking envelope of missing scientific knowledge.  Oh - and were you born into a Christian family ?  Doesn't that concern you?  That your views may have just been shaped by the parents who birthed you ?   Do you equally rubbish the views of Islam or Buddha (who combined, have far more followers than your own cult).  Just saying...

Like any bike, it can go fast enough to kill you very quickly.  Were I you, I'd worry much less about how "fast" it can go, and worry much more about your ability to ride your bike at a decent speed.

You'll be back.. they always come back! I'm most likely headed to Puerto Rico or Washington (The west coast Ohio) until I'm hopefully doing well enough to come back and open a business or two in the area.   The only thing I cant stand is the snow.. but I love the people in my area. It was only three years ago when I was 17 and hated this place as well but once the time came to leave I started looking at it in a dramatically different light. Coincidentally that was the same time I started kayaking and taking advantage of the bike trails.

Hey, don't worry about it, I have a dad that is almost 60 and my little brother is 9.. you can never be too old to start loosing your relationship with your son..  If anything this just makes the time with your dad more precious.
However, once you're tripping face, you're probably just wasting weed.

It has the same squad system and the same basic classes as BC2, it's essentially BC2 but prettier. Also, why do you assume that I haven't played it post-beta? Because I don't like it? Why do I get the feeling that if I said "I heard it's pretty good" that this conversation wouldn't be happening?

Also, feel free to PM me if you'd have any interest in splitting time or something like that... always interested in meeting other folks in the area.
The way it works is, you pay a certain amount of money for each "level" of business. Their rationale is that larger companies can afford to pay more, and also larger companies will get more complaints, just because of how percentages work. So if you pay more, you're allowed to have more complaints before your rating drops.

&gt;as long as they are all subjected to the same random events, they will react identically, without exception.  What do you mean? One might say "yes" and another "no" based on the position of the atom.  &gt;but that's not an indicator of unpredictability, as they're just doing exactly what you programmed them to do.  How are they doing what I programmed them to do? I didn't program them to say either yes or no, I just programmed in the possibility and a method of choice. The fact that it said "yes" is based purely on chance.  I'm not looking to disagree with you as much as actually understand your position.
&gt; Except it's not half the country, half the country is so disillusioned that they don't vote.   For a long time, the GOP tended to benefit from smaller turnout in elections. If you have a base who is so stupid and sycophantic that they'll vote for you no matter what, all you have to do is turn everyone else off on voting and you win. Hence, Republicans play dirty as often as possible and also like to make the claim "BOTH SIDES DO IT".  
I curious how the stuff they start producing after the next few weeks will turn out.  I'd imagine with the FOX deal there're going to give the entirety of their presentation a little face-lift.

There's 6 use cases listed in my original post (link to contracts). The ones that tickle me the most are the Assurance Contract (trusting a government agency to manage public works project), deposits, and the death switch (external state) contracts. The external state specifically mentions why the external state service does not need to be highly trusted.

Absolutely not. Remember, the biggest advantage of having warpgates is that there's next to no buildtime - you warp in your unit and then wait for the cooldown to finish before the next warp in. With gateways you're going to have to wait for the unit building inside the Gateway before it comes out.

My ex was babysitting on new years eve so she called me over to hang out. When the kid fell asleep she took me to his room for le sexytime on his bed. Having no condoms I had to go with the pull-out method. Pulling out just in time i was unable to stop myself from cumming and it all ended up on this kids bed. I went home and never heard anything about it.

The Real Megabuster was a hidden reward for killing... what? 50k zombies? It really never reflects what Dead Rising was like, where projectile weapons were essentially useless.  I do think enemies should be able to slip on his vomit, though...
Well in that case I have nothing wrong with how patents are right now, except for the fact that companies with the most money tend to hoard them for themselves.  That's good to know,  I've always thought there was a set time for all patents.

Precisely. goodnewsjimdotcom mentions in another comment LOTR and how *"it's important to get someone's heart attracted to doing right"*.  That was Mere Christianty for me: I've read it at a time of doubt and struggle and a time came when it felt like I had all the answers I needed, yet something was missing. Through this book my heart and my reason where finally reconciled and unified to such a degree that I was able to move forward.
You can add either/or. But judging by forget_it_again's remarks, I guess you'd have an easier time with just origin.  This is the shortcut I use within steam and it works just fine: http://i.imgur.com/Fboc4.png
I'd really want this to be true.  A couple driving slips years ago, and I'm still "the guy who can't drive" for everybody. I made an ass of myself for a girl in 2003, and people still tell the story.  This is true for my friends too; every embarassing thing goes in your permanent record.
The lifestyle here is great, very laid back, and its a relatively high standard of living. From my point of view [20 years old, high school education] its a very hard place to get ahead financially. If I were to move to australia - planning to do so by february 2012 - I would be earning $10 per hour MORE than I earn in NZ, for the exact same job. $AUD are worth about 1.33 $NZD, as well. 
I remember the first time I flew over Greenland (Amsterdam -&gt; Detroit), it took me a while to realise I was looking at icebergs, not fragmented cloud. And then I looked further north and realised the big white mass wasn't cloud either, but Greenland itself, and the thought of being down on the ground in the wilderness of snow for miles around was just mind-boggling.

I suppose it would.  Is there a way to make a certain part of a song line up with a certain part of another song in a live transition?  Take [this picture](http://i239.photobucket.com/albums/ff57/dudeman55556/illustration.png) as an example.  Would there be a way in a live set to make sure that the red and blue parts played at the same time? I have a few ideas for live sets that would only work if this were possible.
It could have been a far worse reference to menstrual fluid.
True story: Years back, my buddies and I went on a week-long "fly-in" fishing trip in northern Ontario. By the middle of the week, we were hitting on the host's fiancee, because, in our deprived state, she was *hawt*. Could've been a bad situation, but everybody stayed cool.   After we get back to civilization, it takes another week for the photos to return from the lab (I told you this was a long time ago), we get together over some beers to check out the photos and ZOMG!1! She's Fugly!! What were we thinking?!?   tl;dr: Lack of females changes beauty perspective anywhere, everywhere.

I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that his videos are very likely intentionally "dry" and require Capcom approval before they are posted, to ensure that they don't show too much 'advanced' stuff - even just what would be mission mode combos.

I'd say it depends whether Sony wants to do a nintendo, and actually make a hardware profit out of the gate this time.  If so, they'd have to build to keep hardware costs around $350(to make a 399 price point), which means that with the costs of running their own fab for Cell now, they might just cut anyway.  No matter what, we're all just speculating... we'll see what happens in a year or two.
concrete?
it wouldn't prove anything. if you're arguing against the existence of a god, throwing OT hatred in their face is just petty. the conversation is bigger than just one book.

Which really sucks. I quit playing several versions ago because I got sick and tired of having to start new worlds after weeks of gameplay just to enjoy the new updates. I spent about 50 hours on my epic world and it was fantastic. But with every new beta version update you have to start a new world or live in the past. My old world doesn't even work anymore because there were at least a hundred minecart boosters and other things which no longer work with the more current versions.  I will wait until the REAL game is finally released before I ever play again.  TL;DR - Release the damn game already!  Edit - I've heard many people make the assumption that since Notch has already made so much money and is still making more they have really started to slake off on the updates. If the guy was true to his customers he would use the money he is getting paid for the Beta (which is basically a PRE-PURCHASE) to hire more employees (or at least enough) to actually get the game finished.
My understanding (i.e. pre-RWC) is that Phil Goff will happily show up to any debate so long as John Key is there - so he's open to debating with the other parties... just as long as Key is there.  John Key insists that it's a two horse race, minor parties are irrelevant and he will therefore only debate Phil Goff.  We can glean at least two things from this:  1. Key's brain can only hold so many talking points so that he's only good for one-on-one, and that's what his script-writers have programmed him for.  Throw him a tricky curveball question, or confront him directly and watch him squirm - Goff made him squirm a few times actually.  Also, every time his OS crashes, he smirks as he reboots.  Should have paid attention to the Green's Open Source in IT policies. 2. Key is trying to get the presidential style campaign system embedded into NZ politics, the problem is he really lacks the genuine charisma to pull it off and just looks like an awkward tool.  Just look at National's opening address with a "town hall" meeting with a wholly National supporting rent-a-crowd and a tactically placed ethnic rainbow in the front row.  It was a confused PR disaster from a bunch of rank amateurs.
Dungeon Hunter, Dungeon Siege III, Sacred 2  I have seen a few others that me and the gf have liked on the list so far but the above three I didn't see. All three are Diablo like games.  I would however recommend working on the snap decision to pull the controller. Pick support roles to force yourself to assist. It is tougher to hold back if you are the more experienced/better player but it makes the other person enjoy gaming more if they can wade through enemies because you keep them healed and ready for action. Then when they have a hard time you can step in with them.  Also.... never, ever play Spyro Dawn of the Dragon. Tethered together characters and may result in attempted murder of the roommate.
I'd say twitter fits that role better.

This is a petition to the white house, not to voters. Moreover, the only people who will see this petition are either redditors or reddit-minded internet users, both  who are overwhelmingly pro-legalization. Even further, hypocrisy has never been much of a motivating factor in the voting public's decisions, and an overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that the voting public could not give less of a fuck about if the white house is hypocritical. Finally, even if they *did* care about hypocrisy, they'd employ an impressive amount of mental gymnastics to believe that the white house wasn't being hypocritical.
I got the second letter, never did anything about it, got the final letter soon after.  good luck~
The annoying American thing is overstated... just try not to talk too loudly and especially do not do so while in close proximity to strangers. This isn't limited to Americans at all, but for some strange reason I seem to come into contact with a reasonable amount of American tourists who either have hearing issues or just talk really loudly.  The really annoying American tourist might have an aura of importance and treat people in service jobs with little to no respect. It's not common, but it's what I think of when I think of a really annoying American. 99.9% of the Americans I've met have been very polite. I used to work in a Wendy's here which seemed to attract a lot of Americans.  Good luck in your travels, I'm travelling to the States next year so I guess our situations mirror each-other somewhat... got any tips for a foreigner in the states?

We dislike that someone pirated the application, slapped his name on it, and put it up with malware. Both the developer and pirating communities would frown upon this.   If he pirated it and put it up for free without putting himself as the developer and inserting malware, there would be much less alarm. Nonetheless, /r/android doesn't condone piracy.
I was pleasantly surprised! Seeing previews made me think it would be kinda dumb, but I really like it so far. And the end of the last episode made me go, "OOOOH MAH GAWDDD!"
You wrote that being on the internet does not give one the "right" to be an asshole. You're correct; people have that right anyway.  Other than that, after perusing the post I replied to without initially reading it in full, I'm inclined to sympathize with the idealism you've expressed regarding the respectful and enlightened potential of online discussion. I've spent so much time online over the course of my life that I've been significantly desensitized to the abrasive and spurious nature of internet discourse, and I don't always realize that others haven't.
Check your oil according to the manual instructions. If it is too high, remove the excess. You should not drive a car with oil above the max mark. If it's just a tiny tiny bit above it, it shouldn't be a problem, but if it's a bit above max remove some.

That's a fairly clever thing to do. It only really works if everyone has an iOS device, though, and my experience with geeks is that the chances of getting a group together without at least 50% having Android phones are slim.  Would an iPad/iPhone app be able to talk to one running on an android phone?  I'm guessing 'no'. (also, I don't know much about app development, but I'm guessing it's not just a simple port job to go from one mobile os to another)

Hey thanks a lot of taking the time to give me some advice. As far as my income goes, I have been applying to jobs not stop since I graduated in May, and to be honest, I feel very fortunate to have found one even though the salary is not great. I'm making the average starting salary of a graphic designer fresh out of school, so I doubt I will get a better range unless I have more experience. I will keep trying to find something better though. Thanks for all the advice, I will take it very seriously.

A, because you were on your period (definitely lower but non-zero odds of getting pregnant then), and B, because it was probably mostly precum (which usually has 0 sperm in it, but not always).  So I would say, don't freak out, don't panic about a pregnancy test just yet.  Are your periods pretty regular?  If so, wait 3 weeks before panicking.

The thing about the commander is that while he provided assets to his squads, the most important thing he provided was team organization, something thats sorely missed in BF3. Now, it's pretty difficult to coordinate among squads to avoid order redundancy.  We've all been there before, too many teammates trying to capture a point where some teammates could have been better served defending a flag that was just lost. That happens because there's no real way to communicate orders. The commander served that purpose of assigning orders to squads so that all squads were serving a purpose that wasn't redundant.   I'm not asking for the commander to come back - I think a lot of how DICE worked around it works really well - but the part of the commander that is most missed, assigning orders and organizing squads, is really lacking.   My solution: SL-to-SL communication, with ability to see each squads' orders

However local police departments have a long and sorted history in eliciting negative connotations for civil disobedience movements. Police officers routinely engage in behavior to justify their reactions, even when it is other officers who are engage in the original behavior. There is no accountability.   An undercover police officer who acts like a protestor, throws a rock, or starts a fight.   It is not beyond the police to act like this, and in fact has been a part of their strategy which is what the 2003 quote is demonstrating, not to mention the years and years of this behavior. However if a police force was transparent and had uniformed officers present the level of accountability instantly goes up. Now you might argue that people won't tolerate a uniformed officer in their midst. However anyone, regardless of their uniformed status, who presents themselves in a respectful manner is much more likely to garner respect.   I don't think this is a glorification of protesters, however it is questioning the ultimate motivation of a police force that hides officers amongst a group of people. What if these officers do initiate illegal behavior? It wouldn't be the first police force to use entrapment.

We've got other processes in place in our company for this stuff, which only leave manual exports as our option, but I'm pushing to get us plugged into the process somewhere someday, so I can automate some of that as well.  My "grand" idea would be to have a "terms" work folder, with a subfolder for each stage of the process.  When someone get's term'd, a folder with their email address would dropped in step 1.  When working, it would be put into something like a step1.working folder.  Once that's doe, it gets dropped into step2, etc... until all steps are done.  Each step would log it's session any any check results into log files in that user's folder.  And the thing running the whole show would be a script that starts at step1... if it sees anyone, it moves them to step1.working, and starts them working.  Checks if anyone in 1.working is done, and moves them to step2 if so (and no errors).  Checks step2, and so on and so forth.  It also feels a little over engineered in my head, but they change things so much around here, it seems like a fairly modular way of going about it, so I don't have to rethink the whole thing every time, but I've still got accountability, etc.
Or that:)

Shenanigans. Nothing you say will ever make anybody take a hipster seriously.
I disagree with the comparison of hotel full=immovable.  With numbers, you can manipulate these numbers in any way and still have infinite numbers.  X=infinite, (1/2)X is still infinite.  The immovable stone is defined by it's fixed position.  It is not fixed by infinite force Z, where Z+1 would counteract its stationary force.  The test for immovability is the exclusion of motion, so as long as Z=Z and movement is not possible, then the stone maintains the property of Z, being immobility.  I think 'infinite series', an imaginary yet malleable construct is seperate from 'infinite power', where the abstract power is not physical force, but the unintuitive 'power' to break logic.

Sorry you don't understand that probability involves math. 
Gut bacteria changes the amount of calories you absorb from food. It matters, but it also falls into the categories I established.  And please do some basic research into how you metabolize food- the process you're describing is simply not compatible with everything else we know about metabolism.  Unless the diet soda is making your digestion better and more efficient, allowing it to absorb things it previously couldn't, then the only thing you could possibly be talking about is insulin production.  You know what happens when your pancreas gets confused about whether or not it has sugar? You get diabetes. Otherwise, sugar you've got in your bloodstream is turned into glycogen, which is either used elsewhere or turned into fat. Always, and at the same rate.  Any explanation other than *eating more* or *exercising less* because of psychological factors would require that the human body become more efficient at absorbing and storing calories than it already is *because* of diet soda.
Good idea. :)
Yeah, I'm switching to that in the future. I usually let players pick whether they want to roll or do stat buy. But I think I'm just going to pick one from now on.  Also, I worry for you if you think it's only cheating if they get caught. Or that players will cheat if you're not watching. Paranoid.  I don't think I'll take responsibility for something they chose to do, independent of any pressuring force. They made a choice, and it's sort of assumed you're supposed to be honest and we can all work in mutual trust.

Yeah maybe I need to career change and start writing erotic stories/books... and I feel I didnt even explain it properly, and I know I am missing more examples of all this.  Like when she walked in topless to show me her sunburned ass... I have never had that sensation before, and I have been sexually active a long time. Its like my whole body went from ambient temperature to 110 degrees instantly (maybe because such a sudden arousal was unexpected? I dont know). But man I will be chasing that feeling for years, I have no idea how to get it back.   One year for my birthday a girlfriend gave me a 'concubine for a day' gift card, redeemable to her, for anything I wanted sexually, all day. Best gift ever! Had sex for hours on end. Still that pales in comparison to the feeling I had when Maggie was showing me her bum. I dont know why, but I would trade everything that day I used my gift card just for that feeling again!
Ahh... I do agree some aspects of Buddhism are very good. I still follow some things such as "Do not kill, be kind to all creatures, do not steal, give rather than take, and do not consume alcohol or use recreational drugs." These are not obviously all of them but I feel like these are good rules for me to follow but I just cant believe in reincarnation and everything that follows anymore. 
I thought the same thing. From the bits of information I know about Buddhism there seems to be this kind of split. I personally think the cool dude scenario is the better of the two.

As someone from the UK I would like to correct you, the conservative plans with the economy have not worked and have actually slowed growth to non existence. We have consistently had much lower growth than was predicted from when Labour left, and this is because of the deficit reduction plans that the conservatives have implemented, as this was going on before the Eurozone crisis.   Though with this said their plans may have also spared the UKs credit rating from being lowered, but this is debatable. I am not an economist, I do not know what the ramifications would have been if it was lowered but I can only presume it would have been quite bad.

It's pretty much the same reason you can't unburn toast.  Or unbake a cake.  Sometimes things break beyond repair and you have to start from scratch and make a new one. Edit: People don't just die.  There is always a reason, and that reason is usually organ failure.  When you talked about keeping people from dying, we kind of do that to a certain extent with ventilators, transplants, and pacemakers.  The problem with stopping human senescence is that it is incredibly complicated.  There is a possibility that in the future we will be able to greatly hinder the aging process, but that's a long way down the road.  There are animals such as hydras and tardigrades that experience little to no senescence, but these are very simple animals and they are mostly sedentary.

Yes its possible, actually I already had it working with [MultiWall](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/comments/lr11c/multiwall_set_your_wallpaper_better/)   But then removed the feature since crawling the html for links  was very slow (since most of the time wallpapers are non-direct links).  However, if you make the latest daily wallpaper server-side and cached it'll be quite fast.  The thing is; i also write this plugin img2tab ([firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/img2tab/), [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kbbalffcbdlngpklndognfpcipmhdmod)).  I have ported the code to c# .net and it works with multiwall.  I could probably write a quick mash-up that will do what you want, perhaps next weekend.  As for how it would work  What I did is:  1. Download the url content, being the reddit html or rss.  2. Regex out every link you can find. (dont just do img tags or links) its not great for wallpaper.  3. Follow every link and hit test checking the mime-type.  4. If the mimetype is an image, then download it and check the resolution. probably discard it if iits area is quite small, like 250x250.  5. If its not an image, give recurse on the link. (sometimes the image is just 1 page away, like wallpaper sites or imgur)  6. This process can be really slow with pages with lots of hidden links like reddit. So basically you can just add a few hacks for common sites like reddit, which will help speed it up. Like for example, add a hack for imgur, that regex detects an imgur link and then just rewrites the direct image url for you instead of hit testing.  To be fair though, what you will get out from it in the end is that parsing out wallpaper is just hell, making it generic for any html is just too difficult, its better to have these custom wrappers around each different site.  For reddit its a big mixed bag of fish, probably best to just keep it to direct links and imgur links.  OR  Do all ur crawling server-side and let the client hit that for a top list.  The other problem I was concerned about is NSFW wallpaper that might automatically hit your desktop, thats why MultiWall is the way it is, I initially use reddit as a feed, but you just cant rely on nsfw tags etc, someone will eventually cop something inappropriate. Its better to only automatically display something moderated. Thats why it has a rating system etc.  Another thing worth mentioning is, MultiWall has its own feed which should contain most quality from this sub-reddit. You could make use of its existing stream, its json and easy to use.  [MultiWall Stream](http://windowbox.me/multiwall/community/view.php)  I've made a forum post requesting your feature here:  [MultiWall Forum &gt; Request: Live Wallpaper](http://windowbox.me/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=7)  Obviously I can do exactly what you want.  So I'll follow it up when I get the chance.

Ah, the re-hosting to imgur part throws me off, I copy and paste the original link into the search bar. Kinda hard to tell if it's been posted otherwise. 
What does it actually do to the body? Like, I just wonder what is actually happening on a molecular level to the blood cells, tissue, etc.  It is like acid or something?
&gt;essentially, they're turning it into a "flavor-of-the-moment" MMO fighting game. We've waited almost ten years, and we're going to get World of Warcraft with giant robots.  Come on man. Really? I have a feeling that you are scared of this game becoming a "Kill 10 Commando-2D's and return to me for your choice of an 'Eagle Monkey Medium Laser of Burning' or the 'Boom Boom Make Splosion Rifle' "   No one wants that, dev's included.
The CSA is a joke and always has been. PCP met every criterion for schedule I when the law was enacted, but remains in schedule II. Why? Who knows. Probably because they never bothered to consult any actual research and just assigned drugs to whatever category they felt like.

I went to a party where a kid I know did a bunch of weird shit.  1. Had ghost chile paste and put on on the rim of every single cup he found lying around. made for some hilarious times, until i went to get a cup of water at 3am.  2.  He had a vial of sheeps blood, which he used t put bloody hand prints on a bunch of walls. actually made the girl who hosted this party cry.  and a bunch of other things too, all generally of that ilk.

A sad day indeed! I loved his blog and he inspired me to check out all sorts of software that has kept my ancient laptop useable 11 years after manufacture (Toshiba Portege 3480CT).
Definitely not. He had at least one track from one of his other albums, and he had a few remixes from ISAM as well.
Yeah! It's called Red Lion Smokeshop. It's a comic book/gift shop/smoke shop!  Pretty awesome inside. 
It's pretty uncool to get defensive about something you overlooked all on your own. 
I'm dating a guy who's allergic to tree nuts and peanuts. It's a lot of work and worrying and I can see why it could be a deal breaker. But he's a really awesome guy and I figure he's worth giving up eating nuts (except his of course ;) ).

&gt; Itâs not like nonâorganic tobacco is actually steeped in toxic chemicals. That would be absurd. Why would anyone do that?   I'll just [leave this here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_in_cigarettes).  &gt; The fertilizer used might be a minor factor in the carcinogenic properties of tobacco smoke, but thatâs a relatively minor concern.  Well yeah, I agree.  &gt; If itâs tobacco, and you smoke it, it will harm you quite a lot. Thereâs no way around it.  Never said otherwise.

It depends on the game. Most games, I would agree. Others (*Ico* and *Red Dead Redemption*) have plenty of thematic depth.

No, its more polite than honking. They endanger lanes of traffic by not moving over. I think many of them don't move on purpose to get at the speeder - but a speeder will find a way to speed, meaning they'll get around you eventually. By not moving out of the way you're increasing the odds of a high speed incident. Just because for whatever goddamn reason you wont follow common courtesy and move.

Well said. Upvote.
fun story: about a year ago, I met Daniel DeSanto, aka, "you can go shave your back now" Jason. Two down, ??? to go. 
Well, duh.  For example, current technology exists to determine the speed limit on a road, then measure it against current velocity in order to sound an alarm while preparing to contact the police. This could all be done as the vehicular speed approaches the posted limit.  This would reduce speeders maybe ten fold, but ticket revenue would *plummet*.  1.) People want to be able to try to get away with tickets and  2.) Cops want the discretion to pick and choose to generate revenue and make higher profile busts in areas like schools.  Life ain't fair.
I have to agree with the other commenter. Les Claypool doesn't play bass lines, just kick ass bass solos.
Then he is a stupid man with lots of integrity.
I have a very vivid memory from kindergarten when I went to go put my book back in my cubby (which was behind a wall divider) and this girl, Roxanna, had her skirt lifted and her hand down her stockings. I saw and then waited until she got out from the cubby to put my book away. :(

Not that I agree with you, but first: is democracy not mob-rule, where the majority imposes its will on the minority?
Archos has notoriously shitty android devices.
The current plan is to age the pile for 6 months.  Realistically most of the pathogens have a survival rate of under 6 months outdoors.  Then run it through an intensive vermiposting process. Then test for e-coli.   If it's still positive then it'll get aged a year.  Eventually it'll get used as fertilizer or a soil amendment.   
That's awesome. Don't spoil it.
An excellent point. As someone who often misses social cues myself (big surprise here on Reddit, right?), my sympathies went the other way. If I were to really get down into it, my reaction is probably more of a  "Don't not go on a date with someone just because they miss a social cue!" [](/foreveralone)

I found it weird at first, but now I find it funny. I assume most others do as well, or else we would stop doing it. 
Too bad this precedent hadn't been in place a few years ago. My ex only got 6 months probation for two counts of Criminal Harrassment which included posting my personal details on a sight for Escorts along with nude pictures on multiple occassions to the point where I had to change my phone number 5 times in the course of 6 months, sending nude pictures of me to my work place as well as Family members, and my now Husband Hubby and I were dating at the time). As well as accessing my Facebook, posting explicit photo's of me engaged in sexual acts with him (he and I were together for several years before we split up do to his abusive behaviour), Lets see, he called my place of work multiple times, becomming verbally abusive on the phone when I was forced to speak to him and when he was told I was not available. He would leave upwards of 300 to 400 texts, fill up my voicemail with hateful messages including threats of violence to myself and my family members.  Hmm, 6 months probation seems very tame to me, he should have gotten some jail time.  Thankfully I live a couple thousand Km away from him and he no longer knows my where abouts as far as I know.  This went on for a couple years before the police finally acted, and took him threatening a high ranking official till they actually did more then warn him.
That is a YAMAHA baby grand. I used to have one just like it. The one in the pic was PROBABLY made in Japan, given that it is in a McDonalds, and the made in Japan versions are worth less.

Really amazing stuff!
I have a framed picture of Alfred E. Neuman next to my bed for years and years. My girlfriend just sighs when she sees it. Funnily enough, I "inherited" the picture from my grandpa who carried it in his wallet for most of his life. I don't remember my grandma sighing as much as my GF though. Wonderfully tolerant woman it would seem.

Wow you didn't give any thought to what I said at all.
See this one of the worst things about this whole ordeal.  Guess where this is posted: in the COMPETITIVE DISCUSSIONS FORUM. Which no one, ever looks at.  Almost everything, including champion feedback, lore, item, graphical feedback etc. is discussed in general discussion and that's why it is BY FAR the biggest LoL forum. Red's respond to anything in there, it has become the de-facto all encompassing forum and there is a long term precedent that it is where the community and riot interact the most.  However, Matt Marcou and Riot seemed scared to talk about this issue in the appropriate sphere (general discussion) where people will actually see it and try to hide a response in a hardly ever used forum so Marcou doesn't have to face the music.  Even disregarding the decision and whether it was the right choice to make (it wasn't) this cowardice in combination with their very heavy censoring of people who spoke out against them yesterday are, quite frankly, disgraceful. This is exactly what I didn't expect from them and is just making me more and more angry about this situation.  P.S: Don't downvote this reddit link because you don't like what Matt says, upvote it so we can discuss it here, where we won't get banned or moved to the "competitive discussion" forum instead.
sorry man, Livestalk grabbed it first. I'm a Pep Head so if I buy another one soon, I'll post again.

If you're familiar with Breivik's manifesto, it's politically inspired - writing about European multiculturalism, Marxism, etc. If you're familiar with Bin Laden's 'letter to America' you'd know it equally political as it addresses foreign policy, oil, Palestine, Iraq etc. and to say politics don't play a role is dishonest.  edit - fine, I get it, consider this my last post on r/atheism. I started reading posts on here since it started popping up on my front page. Clearly it's not the same for discourse or objecting and that's fine.

It's not like there isn't something in it for even the most legitimate of new car dealerships when they talk to you about financing your car. At the Ford dealership they want you to finance with Ford Credit, for example. It's not a charity or credit union. It's not that profit-taking on the car loan is just the domain of sleazy used car lots, everybody does it, it's just that the bad-credit specialists charge the worst interest.  And, just to play devil's advocate, what's the alternative? Cap car loans at 10% and thereby pretty much deny cars to people with bad credit? Then they can't get a car at all, and then they probably can't get a job.  Regulate the industry, fine/shut down the abusive dealerships... but I actually kind of think sub-subprime car lending serves a purpose.

Back then the relations between the colonizing countries where already quite tense. So an open clash between Germany and the USA might have triggered an open war between the other countries. Great Britain (back then the undisputed leading naval power) would have sided with the US, while the French opposed British ambitions and might have sided with Germany. Not over the Pacific - that was pretty much useless for all European powers - but over Africa (also known as the [Scramble for Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa)).

This is NOT legal advice, but you should be asking yourself what is *legal*, not what is easiest. Be aware of the following from the Virginia Code:  **Â§ 46.2-613. Offenses relating to registration, licensing, and certificates of title; penalty.**  No person shall:  1. Operate or permit the operation of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by him to be operated on a highway unless (i) it is registered, (ii) a certificate of title therefor has been issued, and (iii) it has displayed on it the license plate or plates and decal or decals, if any, assigned to it by the Department for the current registration period, subject to the exemptions mentioned in Article 5 (Â§ 46.2-655 et seq.) and Article 6 (Â§ 46.2-662 et seq.) of this chapter.  **Â§ 46.2-662. Temporary exemption for new resident operating vehicle registered in another state or country.**  A resident owner of any passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle, other than those provided for in Â§ 46.2-652, which has been duly registered for the current calendar year in another state or country and which at all times when operated in the Commonwealth displays the license plate or plates issued for the vehicle in the other state or country, may operate or permit the operation of the passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle within or partly within the Commonwealth for the first thirty days of his residency in the Commonwealth without registering the passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle or paying any fees to the Commonwealth.  **Definitions that might be relevant:**  "Nonresident" means every person who is not domiciled in the Commonwealth, except: (i) any foreign corporation that is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth by the State Corporation Commission shall be a resident of the Commonwealth for the purpose of this title; in the case of corporations incorporated in the Commonwealth but doing business outside the Commonwealth, only such principal place of business or branches located within the Commonwealth shall be dealt with as residents of the Commonwealth; (ii) a person who becomes engaged in a gainful occupation in the Commonwealth for a period exceeding 60 days shall be a resident for the purposes of this title except for the purposes of Chapter 3 (Â§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of this title; (iii) a person, other than a nonresident student as defined in this section, who has actually resided in the Commonwealth for a period of six months, whether employed or not, or who has registered a motor vehicle, listing an address in the Commonwealth in the application for registration shall be deemed a resident for the purposes of this title, except for the purposes of the Virginia Commercial Driver's License Act (Â§ 46.2-341.1 et seq.).  "Nonresident student" means every nonresident person who is enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited institution of learning in the Commonwealth and who is not gainfully employed.  **TL;DR** Unless you're a student, you probably are a resident of Virginia and are required to register in the Commonwealth within 30 days

Republic will be my main. Aside from the fact that my guild decided on Republic, I personally want to Republic because it feels more like 'Star Wars' to me. Every film, almost every game, and a large majority of the rest of the Star Wars fiction comes from a Republic point of view. This is also a reason I'm very excited to try Sith out. I'm curious about the differences, like architecture, technology, culture, and the such. These are things we haven't gotten much depth with thus far, and therefore interests me greatly. Aesthetically, I enjoy the robed classic look of the Jedi Guardian over the Iron Man look of the Jugg. Also as a Commando I can heal and still have a massive minigun. As the Mercenary, I get two measly pistols, and the animations for rockets fired off your back looks ridiculous to me.
Ask questions during class. Don't be embarrassed or think you're wasting everyone's time. If you don't get it, chances are most of the class doesn't get it either.  I'll echo the other folks saying "do the reading," but also study. Here's how to study for tests and exams:  1. Start by reading through the whole assignment/chapter/book, whatever. Read the whole thing, straight through.  2. There's usually a study guide or questions at the end of the chapter or something your professor gave you; even if it's a list of what you'll be tested on. Try to answer all the questions in one pass; mark the ones you don't know or are unsure off.  3. Go back through the reading/assignment/book, but this time focus on the topics you struggled with. Skim everything else.  4. Answer the questions again; again note the ones you have trouble with.  5. Go through the reading again... Repeat until you can answer all the questions. You don't have to do this all on the same day; in fact it's best if you spread this out over three or four days. If you find that there are questions you are just not getting or concepts you don't understand EMAIL THE PROFESSOR or ask about it in class.  6. The day of the test/exam, go over the study guide/questions again before class and cover any remaining difficult ones.  As a former fuck-up who dropped out, went back a decade later, and is graduating in the spring, I wish you the best luck. Stick with it; it's worth it.
I just found it funny how the guy is flying, minding his own business la de da... and then all of a sudden how he screams when the bird collides with him..can you imagine how scary it was for the bird too lol Then when he got frustrated at the bird.. its just amusing.. he seems like a chilled guy.   No one got hurt..everything turned out alright. My laughing cant be called out of line .
Someone successfully impersonated HDStarcraft (a very popular StarCraft II commentator) for quite some time on r/starcraft, even going so far as doing a full fledged AMA.  Over time, the "HD_Starcraft" on Reddit started making questionable comments about other casters, commenting on items in r/nsfw, and just generally going rogue, making the real HD look pretty bad.  He was eventually banned, but only after causing a ton of confusion and damaging HD's reputation quite a bit.
Isn't it pronounced Norfuck (or something like that)? I've always hit the last part hard, like in the world "folks," but apparently that's wrong.
ugh.  So what you're saying is that if you simplify the process it becomes a simple process?   Got it.
What we need is a revolution in toilet design.  You shouldn't have to fear the 'shiver' or a sneeze.
For future reference, we as African Americans do not call each other "nigger" unless we want to be insulting to another African American.  "Nigga" and "nigger" are actually two different words with two different meanings. Despite their origin and derivative nature, "nigga" is an affectation used by African Americans in reference to African Americans and is an attempt to reclaim and defuse the harm caused by the word "nigger."  Here are contextual examples:  (*positive*) "Barack Obama is my Presidential **nigga!**"  (*negative*) "Herman Cain is one fucked up Uncle Tom-ass **nigger.**"  But on the overall context; we would gladly give up "nigga" if that meant we could also get rid of "nigger." We had a funeral for the word, but like vampires and zombies; the damn world will not let the word die.
Yea.  I had been doing the machine for quite a while.  It must have just been some little muscle that I wasn't working.  
Maybe. I swear I'm not a sociopath. I do have feelings. But, that sort of thing doesn't bother me so much. People dying is just part of what happens.  I guess if it was someone like my SO of 10 years I would be a bit more bothered. But, until that happens, we'll not know.

as for the real underground, like word of mouth only events, you're gonna have to keep digging. I'm in los angeles, I got the info for 1 semi underground event like the one I posted, I got the DJ's facebook to find out more events and made facebook friends and got the promters to add me to their lists, then after a few events I got the info for underground word of mouth only warehouse style events.

So, Inflation means more lending (Banks profit)  deflation means more saving (banks don't profit)  Obviously the one that the banks profit from is preferable (for the status quo)  That is probably reason enough for us to have an inflationary monetary policy.

You do know that while Ron Paul has positions about sexual preference, religion, and other hot topic social issues, he believes that each state should have the right to commit to their own ideals.  He believes the federal laws should not apply across the country on this issue because so many people have differing opinions and it is too hard to come to one conclusion.  Ron Paul has one of the most, if not the most, consistent political views we have seen of any politician. He is not a hypocrite, he simply has views that he truly believes in (just like you do). He respects your views as you should respect his, and lets you and your local state decide how to enact those rules and regulations.  If Ron Paul was president, you would never hear him toot a horn about how God loves America or anything like that because he knows it has nothing to do with the politics at hand. He is a Libertarian poster child.

I've generally found this to depend on the class. In my engineering classes, it rarely seems to be "All of the above", but whenever it's a business class like finance it seems to always be "All of the above" if that's an option.
&gt; *"It is merely you attempting to switch your argument in the middle of it, hoping I wouldn't notice."*  Darn!  So close!  &gt; *"Good and omni-good cannot mean the same thing[, as far as I can figure.  Can you explain what you mean?]"*  Sure!  While a human can only be good, there is no difference between a god that is omnibenevolent and a god that is good; a god that is not omnibenevolent is a god that allows suffering, and I don't consider that god to be good either.  I'd call it "neutral" at best or "evil" at worst.  However, as you might define your god to be "goodness" incarnate even if it allows or causes suffering, we would disagree on these terms.  To reduce confusion, it may help to further simplify the "evidential problem of suffering:"  1. A powerful god can prevent suffering. 1. A knowledgeable god would be aware of suffering. 1. A good god would want to prevent suffering. 1. There is at least one instance of suffering in the world that could have been prevented by a god having all three of these traits without interfering with free will.  In fact, let's make it even simpler:  1. A god can prevent suffering.  (An entity that is not powerful enough to prevent suffering is not a god.) 1. A god would be aware of suffering. (An entity that is ignorant of suffering is not a god.) 1. A good god would want to prevent suffering. 1. There is at least one instance of suffering in the world that could have been prevented by a good god without interfering with free will.  &gt; *"You didn't provide any example. If you believe that anything you said in any way support the truthness of your fourth premise, please point me to it."*  I mentioned [tsunamis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/fmn9s/first_last_and_only_foray_into_ratheism/c2u59t5)  &gt; *"Augustine, more than a thousand years ago, dealt with this objection. It is not necessary that you are perfectly strong."*  Can you link me or explain this to me?  &gt; *"It is only necessary that you are maximally strong, that is, that you are stronger than everything else."*  I think there's a difference between being maximally strong and being the strongest.  &gt; *"All-powerful, all-knowing and all-good do not translate to your previous argument of omnipowerful, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. They are different concepts."*  I was under the impression these terms were synonymous.  If you believe they are not, please explain the difference.  Or better yet, if you understand what I'm trying to say, just tell me which terms would reduce confusion.  &gt; *"Semantics is important if you are shifting meanings amidst your arguments."*  Agreed.  However, when I say "semantics," I'm saying the disagreement is a result of differences in definitions and not of any difference in actual philosophy.  I don't enjoy the former as they are meaningless.  &gt; *"Irrelevant. It is the only reason advanced by the Bible as for why you should worship God. It is also the only reason necessary."*  If your holy book told me to worship my parents because my parents created me, but my parents physically or sexually abused me, I wouldn't worship my parents.  If your holy book told me not to worship Captain Picard, but Captain Picard was an outstanding Starfleet officer, I would respect Captain Picard.  In other words, I reserve my respect for those who earn it, and I respect "good" entities, not necessarily just powerful ones.  I don't see why I should respect your god just because a book says it exists and also says it created me and *also* says I should respect your god because it created me.  You might've noticed I ended up saying "respect" instead of "worship."  That's just the result of not knowing what it means to worship something.  I'd feel as though I would be lying if I said I would worship something just because it's powerful or kind.  &gt; *"In a way. The verb worship has more than one meaning, did you know?"*  Why do you worship them and in what way?  &gt; *"You didn't answer my question. How do you know that the tsunami isn't the best possible scenario?"*  I believe I did: humans' capacity to reduce naturally occurring suffering means a god did not.  &gt; *"Furthermore, how do you know that humans have actually reduced any suffering?"*  Example situation:  1. Sandwiches reduce hunger and contain many nutrients. 1. A child is suffering from starvation and malnutrition due to a natural drought in his area.  The child is in pain because of starvation and malnutrition. 1. I give the child sandwiches. 1. As a result of this sandwich, the child is no longer suffering from starvation and malnutrition.  The child is no longer in pain.  This or similar situations have occurred countless times throughout history.  I assume questioning the potential of humans to reduce any suffering whatsoever in response to natural disasters is the direct result of trying to protect the goodness of your god.  This is rationalization at its most extreme.  You have previously demonstrated excellent arguments, so I feel this argument is beneath you, to be honest.
First of all, "people dance in the street" doesn't mean "every single person dances in the street". And second, he probably wasn't referring to Saudi Arabia - after all, he was talking about "when any of the other countries surrounding Israel **kills an Israeli citizen**", and I don't think Saudi Arabia was at war with Israel since 1948.
depends on the situation really.  in general, you're right.  maybe it's to help you solve a problem that you may not even realize is a problem though.  Sometimes our sig. others see things in us that we can't.  Like how i've been ignoring my fitness and health, putting it off, while my GF is very active.  She's been talking to me about his for a while, and I've made various attempts, none too successful.  I keep thinking I'll take care of it soon, but that doesn't work.  It's taken her almost breaking up with me and us being on break (we still are), to realize that I need to get in shape, and now.  Its something that I've always wanted for myself deep down, but haven't applied it to my life.  She showed me that I may have let my lack of motivation to do something good for myself cause me to lose someone I love.  And even if she doesn't come back to me I've realized what I need to do and am doing it.  I've been exercising and eating less meat and food in general for weeks now and it feels amazing. I'm losing weight and in addition I just feel good about doing something good for myself.  Its win-win for me, because if she comes back after realizing that I actually can walk the walk (I do for most things, just not personal health), thats awesome.  but if she doesn't, I will be on my way to having a better body, which is probably the one major problem with my life now.  And i'll be hot :D  edit: we've been together for 2 years now, and she's explained thoroughly that it's not about looks (though i'm sure it is a little bit), but rather about health and well-being.  She only recently told me that she was anorexic, which helped me understand why it was so important to her.  She is very healthy now.
&gt;I know it seems like a monumental match up right now but they've both got 4+ games left this season.  Very true. But I honestly believe this is the best LSU team I've ever seen take the field. From what I've watched of Bama this year, they look fuckin' awesome too.

The parts of the US I've lived in (Phoenix, SF) have this huge divide between "straight" and "gay" that I've never understood.  Back here in Edmonton it's much more like you would think; you're just people.  A 'gay' party mostly just means the event sponsor or host is queer, and is inviting lots of queers explicitly.  But it's not meant as a cultural divider.
Well, I care, and I'm on here, and a whole bunch of other people have mentioned in these comments that they care. I guess that you don't care, which is why you keep trying to argue this point, but the reality is that you're a content thief, and you deserve to be called out on it, which I think I've done.
Hey look, we match! I did the same thing; except I ordered the CE a couple months ago.

Oh, I am well aware.  We have a great irish pub around here that makes fantastic fish &amp; chips.  I somewhat fear what they're serving inside the walls at this Shoney's, but based on experience with their other foods, I imagine it only loosely resembles fish &amp; chips.

We ended up just taking a walk and watching a movie. We came down way sooner than we expected. A half eighth per person only had us tripping for about three hours, and I was the only one who had much going on in terms of hallucinations. I'm also the one in the group who weighs the least and has the lowest percentage of body fat, so I'm thinking that played into it. We're going with a full eighth next time.  We did end up having to abort the walk because there were too many cars. Transformers 2 is only okay on shrooms, also. It was better when we had it muted.

Yes, that could be.  Alistair possibly wouldn't appeal to a 14 year old anyway, a more Edward Cullen-like character might be better?  Another suggestion, though they're probably too retro now - I used to love the Baldur's Gate games, the party system made them really "friendly" somehow.  By contrast, playing an Elder Scrolls game - Morrowind in particular - feels very lonely, though that's part of Morrowind's charm.  The interaction between the characters in BG really appealed to me.

We have a few but something else you need to consider is that the ones you mentioned are high budget shows propped up by huge media outlets and animated by companies in the Far East, the UK doesn't have that kind of style because the BBC hates projects that put British money into foreign firms with no guarantee of a successful product.  The other media outlets don't have the money either and it's easier just to syndicate the American stuff.

No.   You stopped when she said stop.  You continued when she said keep going.  You scared her, but you didn't rape her.  It's usually VERY clear in court cases, rapist don't respond when people tell them to stop, or they make it so their subjects can't say stop.   A few pieces of advice.   A. in the future, decide on the fantasy ahead of time letting her know it'll happen. B. More importantly, if you choose to do a rape fantasy again, arrange a safeword.  
Well, that's $500M that the rich no longer have, but engineers and the ship builders do.
I can see how someone who is listening only would find his act underwhelming. Part of enjoying Lewis Black is watching him get so spun up while trying to make sense of the bullshit in the world. I agree that there are tons of comedians who have better material, but a big part of standup is how the material is presented and he is top notch in that department IMO. 
"But when he arrived, he found them pastures weren't quite so green anymore. The calamity happened."
I think they might - though look how many looters were out with their faces uncovered despite there being CCTV - not really a deterrent to them. I guess their subsequent arrests may be a deterrent, but it kinda comes back to community policing IMO and I think the failure of that is what made the looting sprees possible. 
If I avoid "messing" with motorcycles it is because we're both at speed and I don't want to run over their mangled body after they hit a rut and are flung into adjacent traffic.

Yes, there was definitely a bit of a Bitcoin bubble in June, because of all the media hype.  People think their fiat currencies are stable, but they're not.  It's all going to come crashing down in the next couple of years.  Gold, silver, and Bitcoin are going to be the way to go.  Unfortunately gold and silver are very difficult to spend.  They're great investments though.

I was a tech, too.  Yes, some people do have legitimate pain (I'm one of them, actually).  But... a significant amount of people who get pain killers seem to be addicts.  They use a month's worth of percocet in four days and then scream at the techs, "I'M IN PAIN!  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE!  I NEED MY MEDS!"
They do! I bought the latest bundle while on vacation in China via. paypal, and paypal restricted my account. Emailed Humble Bundle when I got back to NA when the sale was over and only then found out about my restricted account. I asked if I could possibly pay them again to get the bundle even though the sale was over, and they just gave me it again for free and asked me to consider contributing more next time. Definitely will pay at LEAST 2x what I paid last time, when the next bundle comes around.

That sucks man, had to do the same a few years back :( The little guy was sick from the start, so I had to bottlefeed him every day. It ended up with him following me around the house all the time :) He seemed fine for a long time, but then one day he wouldn't eat or move. When we took him to the vet there was nothing they could do...  I cried like a little girl (am a grown man btw) when I realized we had to put him down :( My thoughts go out to you!

&gt; 3) the Standard for issuing a warrant is probable cause. In this case, that came from the drugs in the car.  According to the article, the police obtained a search warrant because an informant claimed Antoine Black had stolen a police officer's gun.  While they were looking for the gun, they happened upon the cash and some drug paraphernalia.  If they don't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime, they shouldn't be able to keep the cash.  It looks like he has already won that battle, but they didn't give him all the money back.  They are claiming that they only took $30k, not $43k.  &gt; Marsico said the amount of money seized from Blackâs home was over-estimated initially and that the $28,980 figure is accurate. All cash that was taken was given back to Black after the arbitration ruling, he said.  so this guy is claiming that the cops initially miscounted the money when they bagged it as evidence?  That is such BS.

I just want to reiterate: Fuck you for posing as a therapist. I went through the rest of your posts, and I'm not surprised to see them consistently downvoted.  When you pose as a therapist, you make it seem as if you're a good source for information. With a topic as serious as suicide, I have no idea how you thought this was appropriate. Luckily, your writing style is so childish that no one (hopefully) will take you seriously.  Seriously, please think about what you're doing.

No, because we have had a lot of state employees(D.O.C. workers, social workers, etc...) have their pensions raped just so Chicago can have shit while the rest of the state suffers. If they're contributing so much to the state, where the fuck is it? It's sure not making it's way south of Champaign. That's for damn sure. 
I think that a lot of people who are familiar with the career would agree that an actuarial job is a great starting position and even if you don't go all the way, it can help you learn valuable skills that can be transferred to other fields.   Believe in yourself and your ability to pass exams and attain your goals. If you don't believe in yourself you definitely won't succeed.
I got that you meant it as a rhetorical question, I just think you're wrong. I think the OP is right, and the public involvement of progressive religious organizations is necessary for OWS to succeed.
I still think it makes LESS sense than most other religions, which were established in much more "primitive" environments, with much less access to information and knowledge about the world.   And how do you explain horses, artifacts, etc being present in the Mormon dictation of ancient America, when they did not in fact exist on this continent until the arrival of the Europeans? It is very well documented that the natives did not have horses and had never seen them when the Europeans came.

My mom called me once to check up during.. it was over.
religious parents tend to tie morality to their religion....for an angsty teen wanting to rebel against their parents....atheism offers vindication for their actions. This leads to atheism being branded a rebellious phase.  To a certain extent i can understand the thinking.....but the cause is connecting morality to religion in the first place.

Say what you will but Paulson has done a fucking incredible job. If you actually read about him in detail (biographies and financial books on the recession) you would know he is humble and a genius.

My gripe isn't with trigger discipline, its the preoccupation with it.  Personally I think loading discipline is far more important, but you can't rag on a photo of a stranger on the internet for that. You should be disciplined with your trigger finger, but the fact that you put it on your trigger does not necessarily mean you are not disciplined. What comes to mind is the photo of Vladimir Putin checking out a handgun, and the comments were LOADED with condescending remarks about his trigger discipline.  Please.  
It's not so bad-  just pay attention to what you use during the day, and make sure you have it.  If you really forget something, you can buy it there.  No one is going to think you look bad!  You need to cover his clothes (bring EXTRAS), feeding (include pumping supplies if you're nursing), bathing (he can bathe in the sink or you can bring a tub), sleeping arrangements (don't forget the monitor!), and diapers.   The weather change will not be that big, just bring extra layers and warm pajamas.  You'll be fine!  Be warned, a 3-hour drive can become 4 hours with a little one, especially with a feeding stop. Just plan extra time.

It's weird being a cynic.  I usually assume the worst, but also assume I'm wrong.  I hate being right, because that usually means the worst has happened.  Depressing, isn't it?  
Actually, not really. I'm a Christian, and I find this particular religion to be just as relevant today as it was back when Jesus was here on earth. All the same "evil" from back in those times is really basically the same "evil" as today. So, back then it was the Roman Empire, now it's basically the U.S.  There is, whether we want to really fully admit it or not, an element of, basically, "evil" that is pushing for the NWO. Jesus' message of turning the other cheek and giving your other tunic to those who have no tunics is just as powerful a message now as it was back then. And in fact, the harder and more distraught the times are, the more and more relevant Christianity becomes.
