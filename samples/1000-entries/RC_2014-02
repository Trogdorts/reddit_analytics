That makes sense thanks
hey could you add me?
Sure it's natural for victims to feel that way - but that's why we don't give victims a say in the penalty, we give presumably objective dispassionate people a say. I think that's a good thing - the feelings of victims should have zero bearing on a punishment.

I like hot knifes, cut a plastic water bottle in half and grab 2 butter knives, put the tips of the knives on the stove until they are very hot, put the bottle in your mouth (to catch the smoke) and squish a bit of hash between the knives.

I did like that, but what really bothered me was the fact that none of his designs made me think of the teams he is trying to show or particularly attractive in their own right. The worst part is that he clearly has some skill and technical ability but he just sort of gets all sorts of lazy and self promotional about it.

Fuck women, Jews, blacks, men, whites, chinks, fags, children, the elderly, Arabs, democrats, republicans, etc....  Does that irritate you? Too bad. Get over it. Not everyone has to like you, and you can't make them.
I don't want to be right. I'm atheist (currently) after all. He doesn't know that yet, just that I have a lot of issues in regards to the church. He understands why I have those issues which helps. But I want him to be able to acknowledge that what he believes isn't perfect and that liberal Christianity isn't just "easy, lazy Christians" but people who have well-thought arguments for why they think that way.  I just want to introduce the idea of doubt into his mind. This his perfect church may not have everything perfect.  I'm currently talking to my sister-in-law about homosexuality. Introducing the idea that maybe, mabye it really might not be sin, especially in committed, married relationships. She is opening up to the idea and I'm so impressed that I haven't received an angry, how dare you think this way response. She thoughtfully responded by saying that I gave her a lot to think about as well as some documents to research and pray about, and that it would take some time, but she was letting me know that the lengthy response time wasn't because she was angry, just a lot of food for thought. :) I was so happy.   I'm doing this whole process as slowly and thoughtfully as I can. My next big topic with her will be about hell. She is definitely the most open to listening in the family. But I'm hoping I can open my dad's heart, ever so slowly as well. If they could only not be so narrow-minded, judgmental and bigotted, it would mean so much to me.  (And I was right in the thick of this community as well, and I changed! I've got to have hope that I'm not going to be the only one! :))

This was an interesting read. As a young man I wasn't really aware Christian romance fiction even existed lol. It makes sense that Satan is infiltrating the church with lurid literature. Sadly most Christians will trust whatever they pick up from a Christian bookstore.  God bless you for analyzing this issue and bringing attention to it. It's important for young women to have a real perspective of dating and sex, not some hyper-sexualized romantic one.

Jago is my favorite current character. He's just so easy to play with and gives other players fits. I really only ever get my ass kicked when playing people that are also playing as Jago. It really sucks when I get beat by someone playing as Shadow Jago, cause not only are they better with my favorite character, but they have the cooler skin as well. FML.  Fulgore was always my favorite in the old KI. 14 year old me was like "So let me get this straight......he's a robot assassin, that shoots frikkin laser beams out of his eyes, has wolverine like claws, teleports, and his head turns into a friggin tank? Yes, yes I will take that one"

This is my major complaint with the Architecture series. The sets almost always look brilliant when built (Hancock Tower is the obvious exception), but the price is ridiculous considering how many small parts you get. The UN has something like 100+ trans-blue 1x2 plates. I missed out on the Robie House, but the build is probably ridiculous with all the small pieces.

The true, upper limit is about 3.4 pounds per day, but that also involves burning muscle, and being an elite, trained athlete.  Normal people of about your size could expect to drop 3-8 pounds of water in the first week, as well as up to 2/3 of a pound of fat per day, assuming you consume proper nutrition, exercise on a schedule, and have no physiological impediments.  I recommend a tracking system for weight, food, and exercise so you can trend your progress long-term and verify your chosen plan and goals are working.  Make a cheat sheet of nutrition basics, such as your daily protein needs, what foods provide high amounts of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber you need without blowing your calorie goals, etc.  Different people respond differently to nutrition and exercise plans, so try different things and see what you feel best with week to week.  Keep notes on how you feel with different foods and exercises.  Unless you load up on caffeine and try to kill yourself running up hills, most unwanted trends will be gradual.  Anything that doesn't improve after 2 sleeps should be investigated for nutrition (missing salts?  Below minimum calories?) or schedule deficiencies (not enough rest after hard exercise?).  If you have any physiological issues (palpitations, weakness, weird urine), or any concerns, see your doctor.  If you bottom out, and aren't yet to your goal, then take a rest.  Skip a couple of exercise days, or eat a little extra for a day or two.  Relax.  Then, go at it again with renewed vigor.  Maybe fast for a day and do the hardest sprints you can, etc.  Whatever, just to shake things up for a couple of days, then go back to what was working before.  If you bottom out and ARE at your goal, you're not done.  Find out what level of exercise you enjoy, and make that permanent.  Then adjust your diet so that you maintain weight week to week, which may mean eating more, or less, or differently.  But you can never "stop".  We're missing the external and physiological signals that say "You are full" and "you need to exercise".  Because of that, we have to be mindful, conscious, and willful about our health all the time.  The trick is to find something that's easy enough that we can make it a decade-long habit.  Whatever it takes, good luck on staying motivated to reach your health goals.

If you have a barber that does your hair, ask him or else go to a hair salon and ask a nice stylist to help you. I know men with unruly eyebrows who are assisted with similar issues.

I sorta like the idea of adjusting the deck and going more mono-red. Replace the spike jesters with Ash Zealots, 1 less damage, sure, but first strike and its second skill is conditional, and it is a human while spike jest is not. Keep running the shred freaks to help ensure black devotion for Mogis' Marauder, but with more red overall, we can justify the 2 red cost of searing blood.  I've been playing around with Civic Sabers too. I think their problem is their lack of evasion that mapcap brings, and the lack of first strike in the deck overall doesn't allow you to trade as efficiently as you might like.

Well, I feel one doesn't train in sightreading to learn to sightread. It's a skill that bleeds into so many other aspects of music, and that so many other aspects contribute to. Frankly, with a few minutes of focused practice on specifically sight reading per practice session, that's all you really need. Working on other areas of training, theory knowledge, technique, all this is really what sight reading is. An amalgam of your skills applied to a fresh piece. Theory tells you what's coming next, technique tells you how to play it, muscle memory moves the fingers.
You're also forgetting the single most important episode (double episode) in which they were able to restock.  When they met up with that other Fed ship and began attempting to take on the crew and all possible supplies because Voyager was faster and more powerful so it made sense to abandon the other ship.  They surely must have stripped that ship of all its photons as one of their main priorities.
I wish we had similar things like this in the UK. So often hear about crazy cheap games and stuff at target and that kind of thing is never found across the pond. RRP for most things. 
That's the one reason I don't own a gaming PC, here in Australia parts are expensive as all hell and it's just much easier and cheaper to go with console, especially if your like me and still low on money due to school.

Well, he's 16 and trying to get laid. I don't blame him. When it comes to a relationship with the opposite sex, they're going to take priority. The best you can hope for is to sit by and tell him you accept the fact that they're dating and you think it's cool, but that he should hang out with you once in a while.  I had a buddy that I hung out with literally every day after school for about four years. Then he got a girlfriend, and it turned into like one to two days a week. It sucks but such is life. Find other friends to hang out with, spend time on reddit, engage yourself more in other activities whether it's housework, school work, playing video games etc.
Technically once you fill the frame it's a clean frame. So a strike and a spare in all frames constitute a clean game.

Which on modern firearms, happens when you load it...so....You're thinking of the badass in the movies who points the gun at the badguy and the badguy isn't phased...so the hero "Cocks" the gun. That's fucking hollywood. You're not likely **at all** to find a pistol that needs to be cocked. Loading the gun will either place the striker in fire position, or in the case of hammer action, the pistol is going to be DAO or DA/SA. Nobody is robbing jewelry stores with Single Action cowboy guns. Everything you know about guns comes from Hollywood.

Well.. it would help to know what version of Windows you have.   My 20yrs of IT experience has been that you're always better off with the manufacturers drivers.   What problems are you having?..

Can you boot the laptop to a Linux LiveCD ?.. Same problems?

Keep in mind that just about all white Cubans (I'm assuming you're white and not mulatto or black) are descendants from Spanish settlers to the island, also consider that Spain was under Muslim Arab rule beginning from 711 until ~~1614~~ 1492 and mixing must have gone on in the first 700 hundred years before Christopher Colon landed in Cuba in 1492.  Edit: Spain was under Muslim Arab rule from 711-1492, Thanks Mr.-LePresident for that correction.
An espresso maker can be as simple or as complex as you need. I recently overhauled by Gaggia Espresso and realized its a fairly simple machine. Essentially a pump and a boiler. It could become really costly to build your own but is definitely doable.   I think an easier (and perhaps less frustrating) route would be to buy a machine used, and go about creating your own PID and possibly PWM device for temperature stability. Good luck in whatever route you choose.

As well as what everyone else said, I'd recommend just checking out Magick (Book Four) by Aleister Crowey.

It's online for free, too.

&gt; A skilled swordsman or spearman would run circles around him inflicting wounds before he could even turn or swing at air.  1.  I think you *massively* underestimate how difficult it was to penetrate a well crafted suit of armor* 2.  He could literally just use a broad horizontal swipe that would be extremely difficult to dodge (you would either have to jump back 10', or dive to the ground), and good luck blocking it   3.  He would have a far longer range (thanks to a larger weapon and *much* longer reach), so he could just wait for his opponent to come to him.   There is no way you are going to be able to close in 15', attack and penetrate his armor, and retreat before he smashes you into paste   4.  You seem to have ignored that given the OP's premise, he would have been trained for war from a young age, so he would be quite experienced in fighting smaller faster people (aka everybody)   [Plate Armor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_armour)*  &gt;Plate armour was virtually invulnerable to sword slashes. It also protects the wearer well against spear or pike thrusts and provides decent defense against blunt trauma.  That is just with plate that normal (small actually, if you look at historical examples) people can support.  Andre was big and strong enough that he could probably support significantly thicker armor that would be even more difficult to penetrate, or he could just use standard thickness armor and be virtually unencumbered.

Exactly. I find it just plain awesome how a rather hidden technique has opened up a simple fighting game to the point it's at now. I'm one of those players that found the competitive scene through the melee documentary so it's still freshly fascinating to me just how far you can take this game and how purely it thrives on technical skill.
Thanks again!

Not right now he's not, but in the future, I could see it.   From what I've seen of his interactions with teammates, his personality in general, and his skill so far, I think over the next few years he could prove to be captain material. It's definitely not guaranteed, but I think he has the potential to develop into a great leader, motivator and face of the Rangers.

I'm aware of a few surveys that have been done through this sub, you might want to do a search for them. The proper science is still in its infancy. I remember last year people being recruited for a proper study, but I suspect we won't hear anything about that for a while.  The term ASMR is really just a place holder until we know what's really happening. Giving it a name was the first step to getting it studied.

The 4th conflag is more a matter of safety than performance.

Twin can be nasty sometimes, popping a conflag or DS just before she flies up.  That's why people prefer to just take the 4th conflag in many cases, and it leaves little stress on enrage timer.
Agreed with all the other posts. I have also played both. After you get the 5 or so patterns down in muramasa, everything becomes rinse and repeat. The boss battles are truly amazing though. It just didn’t have enough replay ability for me. I mean the swords are cool, but there wasn’t enough difference between them to make me say ‘oh I really need to play another 4 hours to get xyz sword’.  I think dragon’s crown is a better game overall. The levels get repetitive, but the chance of goodies in treasure chests keep the mystery and the desire to keep going alive more for me. Also, the side quests are challanging and have kept my interest much longer.  Overall though, you can’t make a bad decision here. They are both equally good and worth playing.
You're a rude asshole. Seriously. I'd break your keybard when you went to the bathroom if you sat next to me and did that the whole plane ride 
My first reaction to this casting choice was, "WTF?" After a few minutes of reflection, I think I can give a fairer assessment: This all depends on which direction the writers are trying to take the relationship between Superman and Luthor. What I liked about Smallville was how the producers developed the connection between the two foes as deep and complicated. This is something that was completely overlooked in "Superman Returns", where the director just kind of forced an assumed antipathy between Kevin Spacey and Brandon Routh. Cavill did a decent job as the man of steel, although I still think Jon Hamm would have been the better choice. However, this would have screwed up the "younger" appearance of the DC universe they're trying to portray. What they did by casting Cavill was create a young-looking Superman. If Lex and Clark are to be contemporaries, then it wouldn't make sense to have had Cavill as Superman and, say, Bryan Cranston play his arch nemesis. Enter Eisenberg. I think most people's initial reaction is that this kid is way too young to play one of the greatest villains of all time. If the director can portray Eisenberg as a scrawny, physically helpless, and insecure little earthling, then his villainy may be created through a sense of absolute jealousy and near homoerotic humiliation between Cavill's Superman and himself. This, coupled with his supreme technological intellect and King Joffrey-esqe sadistic brutality may convince audiences that he truly may be the only one who could defeat the man of steel. However, audiences have seen this kind of villain development before--with Syndrome, the villain in Pixar's "The Incredibles." Plus, Eisenberg is going to have to come up with a completely novel way of appearing technologically savvy, because otherwise audiences are just going to see a bald Mark Zuckerberg holding some shiny green rocks. Basically, I would have had Jon Hamm as Superman, enabling Bryan Cranston to play the role we all wanted him to play (Lex Luthor). Oh well, I'm hoping to be surprised, as I think back to my initial "WTF?" when I heard Heath Ledger was going to play the Joker.
The release clause technically isn't for us (Liverpool) to meet, it's for the player himself to buy his way out of the contract. What normally happens is the buying club will give the player enough money to meet the clause (after tax), who will then pay the selling club that money. As a standard, it must be paid in full, which apparently was the major stumbling block anyway, Liverpool wanting to pay it staggered.  Also, this would take quite a while and again, would be substantially more expensive
Everyone's pissing themselves laughing.

The exact reason that I chose to shoot the guy was because I had another experience with a player that I found in a city (I don't know the name because I was a new player)who told me that he was friendly and he would show me the water pump. Then when I was drinking from the pump that he showed me the exact same guy shot me. 
These wrecks make me think about lore, how even though the ship is destroyed, and even if escape pods didn't happen, there have got to be hundreds of crew trapped in sections of the ship, isolated and safe from the void of space, but slowly suffocating in a powerless ship. Fuck.

There are several things to look for depending on your preferences.  In theory a single battery tube for nthe size of battery that you want to run provides the best performance.  I personally prefer my telescoping mods instead, allowing quick changes between different batteries.  I do highly recommend making sure the top cap has and adjustable pin so it will work with any mod.  Aside from that there are differences in build quality.  Some of the really cheap clones lack in performance and feel, so it's worth looking for well known manufacturers if you're looking at a clone (hcigar, ehpro, tobeco).  Usually the popular mechs are popular for a reason, so read some reviews.  And yes, the overall appearance is definitely important to many people.
*Hmm, this game had great customization for characters. It should work perfectly for Borderlands!*  Really though, it seems like they just outright didn't care about the style or ideals of Borderlands and just assumed great things would be great for all other things.

I agree with you, but I think helos are inherently at a disadvantage. They combine the vulnerability of jets (you're up in the air where everyone can see you and shoot at you) with the slow speed of land vehicles (maybe not *that* slow, but slow enough that you can't just speed away at the first sign of danger).  I'm not saying the game is imbalanced, but helos are definitely easy targets in a lot of ways..

Can I suggest that we get the whole week to try and watch and then we discuss on Sundays.  This way, the day of discussion still lands on a weekend (unlike other subreddits) and you get 6 days to watch 10 episodes or so.  Additionally, 3 or 4 episodes are okay, but in Yu Yu Hakusho 2 things need to be kept in mind.  1) You can't just stop watching after 3 episodes.  2) The long drawn out fights or the tournament team battles will go by faster and can be the topic of discussion if we watch more episodes into them.  You can even change the number of required episodes each week if you want.  I just think that 3-4 is too small a number.  Each to their own, though.
Thank you. Some days are easier than others. In the end I push myself not to slip into the pit of despair, by reminding me of how dad would have wanted me to live and keep on living and loving. It is hard of course. But the way I see it, the way to honor his legacy will be to live a life of love and meaning, like the one he tried so hard to lead. Hugs.

Ha ha, I don't actually watch those shows but I know that Community is having a season finale and HIMYM is ending completely, so I understand.
Because demanding that he allow you to police thoughts his thoughts is very controlling and kind of crazy.  As for behavior, usually compromise is the way to go, but what you're asking for is neither a threat to you, nor something that he can realistically promise which makes compromise a pretty bad solution.  That is why I am telling you you need to either accept this, or break up with him.  &gt;how is it so impossible for him to do when it is so easy for me?  Because you're not the same person?  He probably doesn't understand why you like watching whatever TV show you like that he thinks is stupid, why isn't it so easy for him to love Project Runway as you?  Any number of reasons really: people just have different needs and interests.  It'ld be one thing if he were masturbating at the expense of ever or only barely having sex with you.  But honestly, you demanding that he never ever see some internet titties is probably only going to make that even more appealing to him.  You are making your own problem worse by freaking out so much over something that isn't even a threat to you.

Kefka (Final Fantasy VI)  General of the glorious imperial army, he got magic power (and became crazy) after some dangerous experiments on him (first and last test subject). He makes fun out of morbid scenes, like to destroy things for nothing and has no remorse after poisoning an innocent village's river.  Everyone think he's crazy and that's all, but the whole explanation is a complete philosophy that nobody understands or wants to (like the Joker from Batman).  SPOILERS I almost cried at the end of the game and in Dissidia at his last words :  "Why create when it will only be destroyed ? Why cling to life knowing that you have to die?"  "Life, dream, hope, where do they come from and where do they go ? None of it would have meant anything once you die"  "Destruction is what makes life worth living ! Destroy ! Destroy ! DESTROY ! Let's destroy everyth- !!" and he explodes. I was so sad he couldn't destroy more like he wanted to. All he wanted was to play because creation and destruction were both pointless and destruction was funnier to him. END OF SPOILERS 
Am I the only one who loved S5? They had to wrap the themes up somehow and in my very humble opinion, the crew did a great job. The last two episodes of S5 are probably the best two-and-a-half hours of television ever to be made. And I loved the newsroom arc, too. Guess I'm just different.

Again, you're coming from the stance that comic books are just for little kids, and we're telling you this just isn't true.  You seem to be of the mindset that comic books are childish things that real adults should grow out up when they grow up and it's silly that adults like kid things. This is just your bias. I could just as easily say that girls need to outgrow the fascination with clothes and makeup as they become women, but that just doesn't make the world so.  Adult women still enjoy shopping for clothes and getting new makeup.  Their interest in it isn't something they should abandon just because they're no longer teenagers hanging out at the mall.

Not really, there was no controversy, until racists made a big deal out of the father being black and the mother white.

The problem with Rye bread is that Rye flour in itself doesn't have the strength of the gluten that you find in wheat flour, so it can't trap the air that you want to make a very risen loaf. So, you supplement wheat flour for rye in the hopes that you can get significant lift out of the bread and prevent a heavy, mealy loaf. The problem then, is that you get a loaf that looks like rye, but doesn't taste like it. It is extremely difficult to get a rye loaf to come up with the big holes and open structure of a no-knead loaf. Here's what I'd try:  Make a rye sourdough starter. Take some of an established wheat starter, and feed it rye flour instead. The first time, it'll be mostly wheat and a little rye, but once you feed it for a week or so, you'll find it takes on a nice sour, rye smell and taste and will be predominantly rye. Use this as your starter, if your recipe uses one.   Another thing you can try is to use pumpernickel rye meal. (Bob's red mill makes it, but it is hard to source sometimes- I find it at health food stores)  I add this to most of my breads. It's a coarsely ground dark rye flour and it really adds a lot of texture and taste.   One more thing- if you can find it, try using high-gluten flour instead of bread flour in the mix. The more gluten you can get in there without having to add in tons of wheat flour, the better lift you're going to get.   I love using dark rye flour. Hodgson mill makes a stoneground rye flour that you can find in supermarkets and I really like it. Some white or light rye has really no flavor at all- good for making things like Jewish Rye that have caraway or other flavors in it, but I am more a fan of the crusty dark ryes.

I like the second look, even though you could spice it up with a patterned tie. The blazer in the first outfit would look really great with neutral color pants and a gingham shirt.

I did notice dota taking 1 full CPU which strikes me as odd. Are you using Nvidia or AMD/Ati? It's clearly a driver issue, and most certainly an Ati driver issue :(
You can't just arbitrarily pick which solution you want to be extraneous. You need a reason. When x=0, the value of the function is 0, both for the obvious reason and for the formal reasons pienet already described. When x&gt;0, the function is y= (1+sqrt(1+4x))/2, because the other solution would be negative, which is nonsense.  As such, the function sqrt(x+sqrt(x+sqrt(x...))) is discontinuous at x=0. Therefore the value at x=0 has nothing to do with the integral, and this whole discussion of x=0 is irrelevant.
Those people who bitch are the reason why bf3 got ruined (through balancing). I'm glad that dice is not JUST doing what some whiney people want.they balanced enough. Just stop complaining people. And stop that swearing..geez  If you think bf3 was better...than freaking play bf3.

Don't worry about "effectively" just yet.  Build a solution. _any_ solutiion.  For problems of this size, you can rip up and fix suboptimal things easily.  If you're not entirely sure how to do some part in the middle, build all the bits around the part you aren't sure about, and then start asking questions.  Need to read a file? Read it into some structure.  Need to write a file?  Take a generic structure and make the function that writes the structure out to the file.  Then puzzle through the middle bit.  Don't be afraid to have to rewrite or modify your earlier parts when you figure out that they don't work quite the way you wanted, or that the data structure needed to be different.  This isn't always the right approach, of course, but for most class projects it will do you just fine and get the juices flowing.
Turbohaler edited his comment to be completely different to what he originally wrote. He originally claimed that all guns would be banned. I wrote back saying that was just silly.
This is absolute BS. I've bought some OCZ DDR3 RAM back in 2008 for the sole reason of the Lifetime Warranty; it cost me $400 for 4x2GB sticks. I got them exchanged once, and now they need replacing again. Just my luck that my RAM went bad 2 days ago.

An old roommate and pretty much made an entire horror game's worth of levels. He figured out how to trick the thing into doing a mostly outdoor level too, and made a town.  I wonder how hard it would be to either import the Timeplitters rooms, or make new similar ones to use in UDK and Unity. Just super modular rooms, a few characters, and release them to the public to use.

There was a F2P game once that did this, and i thought it was amazing:  Combining Strategy and FPS:  You have 1/2 ppl playing the Strategy way, building troops.  And then you have a Squad of FPS players, fighting said troops. It was a brilliant Mode, i forgot what it was named though.  It was actually well executed, but their Shop ruined it for everyone not willing to pay a cent for the first month or so.  E: "Battleswarm: Field of Honor" it was called.

My advice is to stick with it!  My mom took a ballet class with me and she kept saying, "This is hard!  But you make it look so *easy*!"  Don't get discouraged if you struggle.  Those dancers who make it look easy have been honing their skills for years.  I know I don't make it through a class without sweating my butt off, fighting against every muscle in my body and silently cursing my subpar extensions while wearing that placid ballerina face.  I encourage everyone to try ballet because your body will LOVE you for it.  You will get amazing flexibility, your legs will look incredible, people will compliment your posture, you'll be more poised and confident when you walk, and despite how tired and worn you may feel at the studio, you will start to feel great all over.  I haven't been able to dance for three months from an ankle injury (not dance related) and my body feels like poo.  On a deeper level, ballet will become a part of you.  I'm an extremely anxious person and I have issues with depression, but once I'm at the barre, all that stress and terribleness melts away.  Ballet requires great focus and drive, and it has a way of getting you out of your own head.  It's the best kind of therapy, in my opinion.  So yeah, TL:DR, it will be hard at first and you may feel like you're not learning anything or you won't ever get better, but I promise you that if you stick with ballet, it will be one of the best decisions you ever make! :-)
I feel ya. My gf buys us 2oz at a time and let's me smoke as much as I want. Life is good. Just got oz blue dream oz of blueberry kush.
Yeah she's over it now so you're good.

I'd say it is definitely evident that Italian is not your first language, but everything you mean to say is conveyed all the same. It's pretty clear because you make errors in feminine vs masculine concordances, for example when the adjective is feminine but you put a masculine article. That is very telling because it's something which can be pretty tricky for a non native speaker, but it comes very natural to all Italians.   As a translator then, and having studied linguistics, I can notice a few sentences which tell me that you translated from English in your mind. For instance, the way you inverted verb and subject in the interrogative sentence "*Riconosce... qualcuno*?", Italian very rarely inverts like that. "*Anche...*" is probably taken from the English "Also,.." but in Italian you can't use it at the beginning of sentences, try "**inoltre**". And "non posso trovare" is a direct translation of "I can't find", but a native Italian speaker would always use "non *riesco* a trovare". These are all things that give the text a slightly odd tone, making it clear you're not a native speaker. Italians would simply use different phrasings.  Now, don't get me wrong, your Italian is really impressive, it's a tricky language and few achieve your level of proficiency. You just need to keep polishing it some more to make it sound more natural.   To fix the concordances, just go slow when writing, go very slow and consider carefully whether you're applying the right gender to each of the gendered words. So if you have to write "your daughter is so mature!", remember that it's feminine and that you have to write "tu**a** figli**a** è proprio matur**a**!"  The other thing is much more difficult to improve... You have to spend a lot of time using the language, immersion immersion immersion. You'll eventually reach a point when you speak or write Italian thinking mostly in Italian instead of translating from English. But you must first "live" Italian a lot in order to build a vast database of sentences "said as the Italians say". But remember that you can get very close to native levels in a foreign language, but never quite reach it. In my Master's there were English professors that had been teaching in Italy for 40 years, and their Italian still wasn't perfect. So don't worry too much about it, just do your best ;)  Edit: some fixes

I think it was around 30 children. That is not 100% fact I thought I heard that on 1 of the news networks. The lunch cost $2.00 and they took it from the students after they already had it, so they could throw it away.

No, don't sweat it. The first kill is always the worst one. Some just deal with it at earlier times and some are more sensitive than others. If you don't feel like the Brotherhood is your home, then you're probably right when you think you don't belong here. The Brotherhood has to feel like it's your *duty* to be here. Any doubts or mixed feelings will only hinder your progress, but then again, it's always good to question things. Remember what I said? Just find where you feel your heart is.

Without a proper DAC and amp, the electrons flowing into the headphones will have significantly more noise, you can think of it as random wiggling as they flow into the voice coil of the headphones. This can actually have permanent shaping effects on the drivers of the headphone (too much unstable electrons will make the drivers get used to them), causing the sound quality from the headphones to degrade permanently.  The effect is similar to when you eat shitty cheap food for a while (because you have no money as you spent it all on headphones), your standard for food could go down permanently (your taste buds degrade in their sensitivity), and you will have a harder time enjoy better food later.  A DAC and amp with low distortion basically "line up" the electrons flowing into the headphones (like eating at a 5-star restaurant), and the needless jiggling effect is minimized.

&gt; I don't have a picture, but deep in Memorial park there is some sort of abandoned stone building, maybe someone else can provide a location  There are a few of them, south of the Green Ridge trail.  There's a spur going to the south, through an area that until a few years ago was kind of a meadow.  Follow that spur and you'll find them.  They are the remains of the old Camp Logan, back when the park was a World War I training camp.  Not sure the exact location, but [it's approximately right here](https://maps.google.com/?ll=29.759545,-95.429931&amp;spn=0.001413,0.001206&amp;t=h&amp;z=20).

This one isn't really bad but I'll share it.  In 5th grade our teacher was talking about American History and he randomly asked "Does anyone know what they paved the roads of Philadelphia with?"  Without skipping a beat, I blurted out "Cream Cheese?"  No one else really got it, but this poor man nearly died laughing.  He was bright red and crying his eyes out.  He couldn't resume teaching for at least 5 minutes.  To this day it may be one of the best responses I've ever came up with.  My comedic career peaked in 5th grade.
Which gets back to my first question. Why are they interviewing the anthropologist? I want to hear from the cast away.

Thanks! Perhaps partly Greece was more of a splintered society than Rome, and so there was no state-wide revolt of the same size to get the attention?
Good point.   I still think that what black metal became from the Norwegians is a bit more limited. I think that the core elements of black metal are more specific than that of death metal.   I don't wanna sound like I'm.... I dunno like I have something against BM lol. It kind of sounds that way, especially when I used the word 'limited' above. I'm a huge fan of both black and death metal; it's simply fun to kinda debate stuff like this though, ya know? ^^
Ahhh, thank you so very much!! :D
Personally I would only care for Sucker Punch. Extrasensory is definitely usable as well. I've been wanting to run a Work Up set, but Work Up on Zorua apparently is *event-only* so I don't have access to it.   Currently, I'm just using a Hasty 6 IV one with:  -Sucker Punch -Nasty Plot -Dark Pulse -Flamethrower
Sorry I meant from, I am on my phone and it does strange things. Yeah the 9x4 isnt really a rule. It is just very helpful for newer players to build a new deck. If you want your deck to be fast you usually play around 22 land and  38 cards that cost usually 1 to 3 mana and like 2 to 4 ish 4 drops. Then if you want morr of a mid range / latr game deck you wanna run like 24 to 26 land depending. So you can play one every turn.

&gt;Because there was literally NO evidence. Someone saying they saw me hacking, and me saying I was hacking? If that's solid evidence then half of the community would be on the UBL. For example, Player A kills Player B. Player B calls Player A a hacker. Player A says "Oh yeah totally I'm hacking". Player A gets banned.  Lots of people are on the UBL for this already. Take NoFear's case, there's no proof he hacked is there? People called him a hacker, but you have no real proof of it.  &gt;Not anymore. Are you paying attention to the reddit posts? Because this cannot get me banned, which is the only reason I would ever consider it, and I'm not doing it to harm anyone else. There is no video evidence against me either, unless you're commenting about SergeantGnome's video, which was obviously not hacks. Also, send not needed reports to the courtroom? Wat are you even talking about here?  You can't get UBL'd yes I understand. However hosts can still ban you if they believe that they can. I wanted to raise awareness of this as it is not your first time hacking on a UHC related server. And those hacks were very clear and we know you probably still have them on one of your minecraft profiles which you will probably use soon.
I think it's just cornerstone items and one handed melee weapons. We don't have attachment points and the boundaries for guns yet.
God, Alistair looks so much better now. Will be interesting to see how he performs. 
No, that's not true. Unfortunately, both the 780 and 290x are newer cards so reliable info is hard to come by. I have heard that the 290x excels when you're playing at resolutions above 1080p but I've also heard that it's very loud and hot. Again, if it were my money I would buy a 780 or 780ti. You really can't go wrong either way but the 780 is about $100 cheaper than the 290x so take that into consideration. Whichever card you choose you'll be happy :-)

Sorry about your pup. :( It sounds like you are having a really bad day. What I ask myself when I feel hopelessly miserable is: How can I not make this worse? Sometimes that leads to me getting focused on something good, sometimes it just means I cry a bit and go to sleep early. Some days are just hard. But you are not alone in this. 
Then it's your fault for either taking so long to play/meet the reqs for league, not theirs. They have always said that it's monthly (and if you didn't know then it means you were playing without informing yourself, which would be also your fault.).
I have on multiple occasions in busy airports, been told I can wait for a female agent or deal with a male agent now. The thought of missing flights, especially connecting flights, is way too stressful so I just go with the males.

the latest builds are on the 1.6.4 version of minecraft where the version you guys are playing is still based on the 1.5.2 version of minecraft.

They aren't yet stable 100%, thus not recommended yet but, I've made a world on it and am helping sort of test it.   Anyhow, I'll keep an eye out for more vids when they appear. 
I suppose thats a hard limit for you. Its fair to have that limit. But you need to realize, instead of going into the relationship trying to change him, maybe try looking for guys who don't watch porn on principle. Religious guys and things like that. Because while this is a hard limit for you, porn is a big part of Western sexuality. It's been around since cave paintings. And you can't change an integral part of someone's sexuality just because you said so. He is not gonna change, you are not gonna change. Break up and find someone who's sexuality who is in line with yours.

People wanted bigger "bro" trucks so ford stopped making the ranger in 2010. Since then retarded fuel consumption regulations based on wheel base have come in and mini trucks have to meet the same standards family sedans get. Now every truck has to have a huge cab to make up for wheel base, as seen with the new Tacoma's. Biggest problem with this is that they often come with a bed so small I started calling them an SUV with the cap missing instead of a truck. Because of this a new North American ranger would do nothing but compete with a more expensive F150, and it would sell more. I've herd that with this big 2015 lineup ford has, the Ranger will be returning. This can only happen with an ecoboost engine or an extending cab with a rear bench seat, so no more mini truck.  Edit: wheel base fuel consumption is what everyone I ask has told me.

[*A Thousand and One Nights*](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-thousand-and-one-nights-a-game-of-enticing-stories#description) does this very well, in my opinion. Players are courtiers, servants, princesses, huntmasters, viziers and so on in a Sultan's court, and the general feel is based on the stories of Shahrazad. They pass the time by telling tales to amuse one another and the Sultan himself. These can simply be tales meant to entertain, or they might have themes meant to curry favor, or the events and characters could be commentary/allegory on the others around them. (Create a treacherous vizier in a tale, for example, and have the "real life" vizier responsible for playing that role.) Each PC has goals they are angling for, and other PCs &amp; NPCs they want to interfere with or help if they can, but because of the Sultan's influence, the telling of tales is where they are most free to do so.  At any time in a tale, another "tale within the tale" can sprout up, as the characters in the story the PCs are telling start spinning a yarn themselves. This is as "deep" as it goes, as far as Inception-style layers, but it's definitely in line with what you're looking for, I think! You start the game as characters playing characters (the storytelling), and can take it to the point where your characters' characters are, themselves, playing characters! It's a bit disorienting at first, but *great* fun once you get into the swing of getting your "real-world" jabs in on the sly.

I've used .75, .8 and (currently) 1. Gonna try the .833 setting for a bit and see how that works.  I can tell you that I've been able to adjust to each ratio perfectly well, even though I was effectively using two different sensitivities. If it feels comfortable to you, you can probably do fine with it. But using the same sensitivity is probably ideal if it feels comfortable to you. Since both .8 and 1 feel comfortable to me on my current sensitivity, I'll be trying .833 for a bit.

Yet another insecure Android fanboy who can't handle the fact that someone else out there in the world might rate another product higher than ones you like and prefer them. Why not look at an example of how high they can rate Android? The HTC One GPE and Samsung GS4 GPE was rated an 8.6. Higher than the iPhone 5c if you want to stick to that comparison. Actually, I just looked at what they rated the 5s... and it's only an 8.8. Seriously only 0.6 off from this phone. You're making mountains out of moleholes.

One thing I learned is do not follow the pumps after they have started. You'll usually be too late to jump on them by the time you see significant changes.  By the way I see that you expected it to become 25% of Bitcoin's value probably because there are 4 times as many coins. This would only be possible if the amount of total fiat bought into Litecoin equals the same amount of fiat into Bitcoin.

Considering Stewart has had other shows where he addressed the grave problem of Obamacare not addressing the *cost* of health care, the fact that he chooses not to bring that up to the House minority leader, who was instrumental in passing said legislation is troubling.  Much easier to soft-ball her questions about a website not working than hit the nail on the head; that Obamacare fixes very little.  
I don't want it to be true because I want Jon to get what he wants. Jon wants to be a Stark. He wants to be his father's son. If R+L=J is true, I think it would crush him. And if he finds the ~~hard~~ harp in the tomb (for those that think it's there), I think he'll destroy it.  Edit: word

Giroud already had one down period. After his goal vs. Palace on oct 26th he produced 1 goal and 1 assist through open play up til dec. 29th.  If anything I find security in the fact that goals are spread widely around the squad. Giroud has scored 20% of our goals, and it is not as if none of these could have been scored by Bendtner, Podolski or Sanogo. Fact is we do not rely heavily on Giroud, and if anything it seems more likely that he picks up form than drops.

Just finished it. This was an awesome episode. It felt like a really good episode of Star Trek at times, just updated from the nineties to now. I'm definitely going to play this one again!
 MEXICO - The ex middleweight champion and current WBC number one contender at super middleweight, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., states that he will not have problems making weight for his next fight against Brian Vera, and added that he might be joining the camp of the Mexican trainer Robert Garcia.  Despite the fact that the last few weeks it seemed that the relationship between Chavez and Garcia has not had a happy ending, Chavez Jr. told ESPN Nation that he was closing a deal with Robert to add him to his team in Culiacan, not in Oxnard, as had been planned initially.   "Well, I'm only 12 pounds over the limit, it shouldn't be a problem, this is what I had weighed the night before the fight against Vera," said Chavez Jr. "I have taken this fight very seriously, like never before in my career, with a lot of hunger, to demonstrate the discipline that I have, the work I've done these last few months, I have the opportunity to show the people the other side of what they've been seeing, I've been training for a long time, the people will see a different me," he added. (Run on sentence was in original article.)  Chavez was in front of the cameras with Frida and his little Julia, who, he assures, has been a great motivation in this new stage of his career, and that has done him very well in every sense, as he has begun to discuss a world championship.  "Logically I'd like to be champion, there has never been a Mexican super middleweight champion, we will see what happens, I would like to see how the fight with Brian Vera turns out, in this weight class there are great fights and great fighters who I can face," shared the Mexican pugilist, who will turn 28 on February 16.  With regard to the routine and the possible arrival of Robert Garcia, he expressed: "I am working two or three times a day, I run in the mornings, train in the evenings, and I have prepared myself for four months, I have to work hard on my diet, and at the gym. I will finish my work in Culiacan, with Vladimir Baldenebro, my trainer, and it looks like this week I could incorporate Robert Garcia into the team, who will help me out for this fight.
I think if you're going to use magic at all, there should be rules. Give the people who possess these special abilities limitations. Oh, your character can manipulate fire? Great, but he isn't necessarily fireproof so he can't shoot fireballs out of his hands without severely burning his hands and forearms, or something. Basically, don't make them all-powerful beings that can destroy the world in an instant.  An excellent example of rules to magic is Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy. There were clearly defined limitations to people who could use magic, and he even incorporated a pretty creative system to give characters a "mana pool" so to speak, so they couldn't use their abilities indefinitely. This particular limitation itself came into play multiple times, and greatly affected the characters during combat and other aspects that Sanderson's magic system provided advantages in.

I think the rooming with 5 other people was more the problem, but what annoys me (admittedly, for no good reason) is that they could've gotten her a very nice 2 bedroom apartment in Astoria for that price, and her commute would be about 45 min. But she can't handle the stress of waking up late and waiting for the train. How well are classes at a school with one of the highest suicide rates in the country going to go if you can't handle a little train delay? Time to grow up and learn how to wake up on time.  Damn, I must be getting old...

I'm pretty sure something like this was done in my area of Lynnwood, Washington. I tried to switch cable providers from Comcast to Century Link because of price. The representative with Century Link explained to me that because of laws, they could not provide or build a network in my area. That probably explains why the only other provider in my area (Frontier) only has 6gb internet while comcast can provide upwords of 100gb.  THE OUTRAGE!!!!

Yeah I got it all the time. I was the old maid in my hall by the time I was 18 and people were questioning my sexuality as early as my mid teens because my eyes were more on books than the boys in the hall. I won't lie; the lack of opportunity not just in relationships but everywhere was a factor in driving me away.  Now that I'm out I have zero desire to marry or procreate, though at 31 years old some people look at me askance for that. I don't know how much influence my JW experience has in my utter disinterest in checking off those two life milestone boxes.

They fail to realize that at the end of the day, flight travel is a business. If they made the seats gigantic there would be fewer passengers, more wasted space, and less money for the companies. It's much more financially practical to have regular seats and if someone takes up two seats they can purchase two tickets.  Maybe here's a comparison the titpee mods will understand: if you're at a restaurant eating your dinner and someone came up and started eating off of your plate, you would be naturally outraged. It doesn't matter if it looked like you could skip a meal, you paid for the meal yourself and not so some stranger could scarf it up without permission.

Not exactly. Dehydration is the reason for a hangover, but if the body metabolizes alcohol slowly  the amount of water ingestion doesn't affect the quickness of the alcohol leaving. Think of it as drinking lots of water while you're drinking. The more water you drink doesn't sober you up any quicker than if you didn't drink any water.

Please take this is in the nicest way possible but you shouldn't be giving tax advice when you don't know the tax code.  Student loan interest is no a part of itemized deductions and should not be considered when determining whether to take the standard deduction. Your transportation to and from work is not deductible. Home offices are incredibly hard to deduct and not get that pulled back upon an audit.

Everyone else is right.  But also... Be very, very careful about your selection of professors.  The thing people don't tell you is that while many of the professors are extremely intelligent and highly experienced, many of them are also terrible, terrible educators.  Grading policies can be nightmares, classroom policies can be ridiculous, etc.  Go to [rate my professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com) and search the available profs when you're registering for classes and read reviews.  Take them to heart.  If you can take summer classes at a local community college where you're from when you're home, do it.  Saves you tons of money. If you have questions about specific issues with your account or registration or anything like that, there's a helpline you can call.  Go to the ERAU website and click on help and look around for resources.  Saves you the Riddle Runaround most of the time. Study.  Do your homework.  Pay close attention in class.  The professors expect a lot out of you, and when you move on to the next class they'll expect you to remember everything from your previous course.  Take it seriously, or you'll fail out like everybody else. (Also, knowing your shit helps to combat the occasional crappy professors) Go to freshman mixers and stuff, meet people, make friends, join clubs.  There isn't shit to do in Daytona, so your social well-being will depend entirely on the people you can interact with.  Also, it helps to be able to study with people and do homework together. Own an umbrella and a raincoat.  Don't pack much winter wear, it's only below 60 for a few weeks a year, and only ever below that for a few random days.  Lots of t shits and shorts and sandals.  If you have more specific questions, feel free to ask.  This sub is kinda dead, which is disappointing, because I think plenty of people on campus use reddit and just don't think to find it.  If you have any questions you wanna PM me, feel free, I'm available 24/7!  Also...congrats!

I haven't played the iOS version, but I hear it is on a par with the console/PC versions (it also supports the new-ish 3rd party game controllers). However it is less pretty and lacks a few of the characters that are in the other versions. I did play the previous game on iOS, and it was pretty fun. Both the button and tilt controls worked very well.  It has also been "appified" with in-app transactions, so the full game as it is on console, isn't immediately accessible. There may also be some sort of energy meter type thing that restricts the number of races you can have per day or something, but I'm not sure about that.  The VIP Pack is a one-off purchase unlocks 4 characters, the Grand Prix mode and the Multiplayer mode. So getting that for free at the moment might make this $2 sale pretty good value.

But the choice related stuff is very key to the story of the whole mass effect universe. Making everything the same with minor differences would be a cop out. If they are going to have saved game importing, there should actually be major differences in the political landscape. Otherwise you have the same problem that mass effect 3 had, all the choices you made before were essentially made non important because it happened somehow else outside your choice, and made your choice feel unimportant.   I think because this is not focusing on Shepard, they should just pick canon and move forward with that.

Clear speed is slow even maxing W first. Would probably be fine if you could just activate/deactivate W like Amumu. It just doesn't last long enough, causing you to take a lot of damage and not kill things fast enough.  Without blue buff, she uses a ton of mana. I find myself constantly having to go back to base.  Honestly, I don't find her as tanky as most other junglers, while also bringing low damage. I don't really see a point in picking her, although her ultimate is awesome. Everything else is "meh."

Great connections! You're a little off on the creation myth though though: in Japanese mythology, it is actually the pair of creation gods, the male Izanagi and the female Izanami, who dip the jeweled spear into the ocean, forming the first island of Japan from the foam (Izanami gives birth to the other islands after they descend to the first island). Amaterasu is formed after the creation of the islands in a different story, from water used to wash Izanagi's eye. The Imperial Family is mythologically descended from Amaterasu, so Japanese are chosen in that sense, but not by the creation gods themselves.
Thank you :)
I think that's it. Thanks!

Well, see there lies a problem:  You cannot change the rules of the game in the middle of the game. You cannot be taken seriously if you keep changing the rules. Otherwise, cryptos are no different than government printed money. We have to set it, and leave it alone. Change it only in extreme situations, where the currency is threatened. I think the current system is perfectly fine.

Why are people complaining that other people have been let in on this deal? More sales means more money for the devs and possibly quicker releases of future episodes. While the devs aren't advertising the sale, it is one that's available to everyone. Thanks OP for sharing.

Fair enough. But he was still just late for a meeting. Its shitty... but it happens. I've been late for a lot of meetings in my life. I've never misspent $2.5 million on advertising for a program that doesn't exist. Or $50 million for a gazebo and other pork.

Some old, creepy guy who looked like a drug addict suggested to my sister that she should get into his car for some "privacy time." And he said this right in front of me.  Long story short, a 5'4 120-pound me kicked him right in the ball sack.
He spelled payroll wrong.  I bet that's a clue...
Yep. My friend once jokingly slapped me, not hard at all and i forgot why,it really didnt call for how I reacted, he did as I was just starting to come down and it lit not just a torch, a BON FIRE inside me.

I find it so bizarre that this album was 20 years ago.  In 1994 the albums that were 20 years old *then* were by Clapton, Eagles, Stones, Dylan, The Who, Joni Mitchell, etc  It's just weird that this music is now as old to us now as that music was at the time.
Yeah. I can see why they would be upset. That's money out of their pockets. But the public opinion was basically, "you're a bunch of greedy millionaires who care more about money than music". And I kinda see where they're coming from too.

Well, she's looking into getting her hormone issues fixed as soon as possible. We've talked about it before, and she feels crazy guilty about it. She feels like she's not good enough (there again, self-esteem issues). I've tried convincing her otherwise, but she feels like SHE's the problem. I have brought up the fact that there are "other things" we can do, but a lot of the time I think it slips her mind...not to mention that those "other things" usually leave me craving actual sex that much more, and therefore aren't usually a good idea.
We didn't really talk on the social media accounts, just an occasional comment back and forth. But then he messaged me out of the blue and here we are. I think thats how I am now.

I'm trying not to build up expectations because I know I could be completely wrong about him once we meet. I'm hoping its not the case though.

Azumi let out a slow sigh as Mal spoke. Of course the Dangai would need to be fixed before the balance could be rectified. She knew that very well. "I know that." She replies in an aggravated tone. "My point, which you have clearly missed, is that we need to focus on restoring the balance first, and then clean up the restrictive current. The former is much more pressing than the latter." She sighs again, a bit annoyed. This one clearly does not understand.   Azumi slowly stands up. She snaps jer fingers a few times, and a holographic representation of the Sol system appears over the table. The sun was in the middle of the hologram with all the planets in the right places. Two more planets than usual were present, orbiting the Earth.   "When I split the worlds, I originally tried using literal wormholes in space to take the roll of the Garganta and Dangai, until the real ones were fixed and working again. Using wormholes will be easier than literally rebuilding the Dangai and Garganta respectively. Ideas?" Azumi claps her hands together in front of her, and makes a pathetic attempt at a smile.

The safe pick is Black Knight.  The thing about Illidan and Antonidas is that they'll likely be cleared before you can attack with them, so you're looking to play cheap cards on the same turn to get their ability.  That means saving your mirror image/frostbolt, etc.  I'd say the archmage is the most powerful, but also requires the right position.  He won't help you if you're losing.  Black Knight can turn things around (or be a major tempo gain)
Thanks!

/u/aoa9293 answered your question excellently, but I should add that in Islam, there is no "clerical hierarchy." If there is a caliph, he has authority over everything, basically, but other than that, there's not really a hierarchy as there is in some other religions (Catholic Christianity, for example.) 
S2 makes silly mistakes but at the same time don't got the same amount of resources as other companies for example Riot games and Valve.  S2 made a great game IMO.

Sounds like what he did to the insurance company's back in November where he said he would give an extra month with your original insurance company AFTER they signed up for obamacare. The insurance company's already processed and removed clients and Obama just waved his hand and said give them more time but the insurance company's were like "we can't go back we already made changes in the system and paperwork." And obama was like "its in their hands, its up to them now" knowing it couldn't be done and just putting the they Won't do it blame on them. I just paraphrased and I have a few beers already but you know what I mean   Tl;dr - Obama makes promises and puts the blame on other people.

Glad to hear you're doing okay. It seems like I've gotten every damn bug that's gone around this winter, but it doesn't seem to be triggering a relapse. Maybe it's because I work with the public and I touch money. I really try to be good about hand washing and spraying lysol when jerks come into my store and cough and touch everything. I'm new to all of this, so hopefully my copaxone will help boost my immune system. I see my MS doc in a month, so I'll ask him if there's anything else I can be doing for my immune system. Try some acidophilus tablets if the antibiotics upset your GI too much. Hope you feel better soon!

If I were you I would blanket everywhere with resumes. A good trick I heard of was to drop a stack off at the electrical supply companies, right by the coffee maker (of course ask them first). That will get you a lot of exposure quickly as the coffee maker is the first place the guys will go.  Make sure to make your resume appealing to a tradesman. Nobody cares about unrelated jobs. Focus on things that are related to construction/maintenance. If you don't have that kind of experience, get some(labour, technical, anything). It's very competitive in Ontario and if you can't make the grade you might miss your shot.   I tried for a long time to break into the trades back in Ontario and it never happened for me. I had to move to Alberta to get my ticket. So, if worst comes to worst and you can't find anything, consider relocating. I could show you how to get hired immediately.

Its about time that we accept that the role of religion is not very much different from that of fairy tales and fantasy tales for kids, i.e, TO INSPIRE THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS into the growing mind of a CHILD.   I'd like to put forward myself as an example here. Even though as a kid i was very much religious, i now support more of an existentialistic philosophical view because i find it more practical and logical. I still am very proud of my religious heritage and very romantic towards the morals set by it, but i feel that an individual has the power to elevate these morals towards a more ideal form by logically thinking over them. In days when i feel emotionally vulnurable, rather nihilistic, i turn towards religion and feel inspired to see that a group of people gain confidence by defining morals to achieve for themselves and by doing so given positive meaning to their existence. But one needs to realize that once they've reached those morals which usually should happen when one grows out of childhood, they should then use those achieved morals as platform and aim for improving them further. Finally, the assumption in my opinion is that the premises of the child are ideal for him to believe in the fairy tale(which here is religion)   P.S.-Im new to reddit so plz cut me sum slack on language and other aspects of dialogue.

So yeah, if all of the above is now simply considered "trash talking", that's all you were banned for.
Not to badmouth our beloved club, but we have been pretty generous with the bids for Carrolls, Downings and Borinis, but been pretty cheap when it came to the likes of Salah, Mkhitaryan lately which tells me that Ayre spent those 3 days being cheap?
It's probably your cell carrier blocking it.
Post quality and quantity is directly tied to the game itself.  Due to reasons, PGI/IGP have systematically driven off a lot of the people that gave enough of a fuck to even post and discuss MWO to begin with, and the redditcommunitywarfare that ensued seems to be a microcosm of the overall situation as people that have been around long enough to be disappointed stop seeing eye to eye with those still wearing their rose colored glasses singing kumbaya.
It gets better, at least when it reflects on your own kids. My brother turned into an abusive terrible human being like my mother. I turned out to be an amazing mom, but I still struggle with rationalizing my emotions. I depend on a lot of literature and peer review before I make a decision. It's worked for me.
I did not know those even existed and I'm kind of disappointed with humanity 
Keep in mind last Thursday the update came out at 6:45 CST. It's 6:00 CST now
I SEE IT I FUCKING SEE IT IT LOOKS LIKE A TINY NUG GANDALF
They probably frown upon being Restricted Free-Agents.
No. It shouldn't be something a player has to do. At the very least Keen would have to give the baseboard for players to mod it in. If they don't, it would be practically impossible.
There's still going to be a ton of chrome on the car, black kidneys won't look great. 
What is the current startup parameter string for the database instance? Can you include the old path and new path in your reply?
As the useful wikibot points out, 76% of those expats are from South Asia and hardly likely to be enjoying the high life
Can it also be $∞ ?
Reddit, youtube, facebook, lots of texts, 1 hour phone call,about half an hour of GBA emulation etc. I was really really bored at work lol. 
ATT customer service has gotten pretty good id say. Advanced warranty exchanges are a breeze and they don't even ask any questions. I've had dust in my ffc and after my 4th replacement I asked for a different phone and they sent me a 1020. Pretty sweet 
Green's my favorite color so win-win
Hmm .. Counter spy all up in this bitch?  Lav en liste over subs så som inglin, danmag, osv, for alle lande der kunne være en trudsel. Så tjekker vi dem efter skumle planer.  For selvfølgelig er der skumle planer. Danmag er en stor magt, alle vil have en del af citron månen!
Triage is perfectly acceptable in business and government. The 1% accept that 10,000 employees losing their jobs will save the company profit margins a perfectly reasonable out come. The 1% accepts 50,000 american casualties and 500,000 civilian casualties as perfectly acceptable costs for cost plus defense contracts. And the numbers are telling me that eliminating 85 peoples right to exist as they do will double the income of the bottom 3.5 billion people on the planet. I find this a perfectly acceptable sacrifice. It isn't personal, it's business.
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.

please add mee! i would appreciate it soo mcuh!
Staircases with stairs just far enough apart that you have to put both feet on one of the steps.
He'd only been on reddit about a month back then!
Where is the butter in I Can't Believe It's Not Butter?
Me too. I really want Nolan to at least talk about what him and goyers ideas were for it. 
It fits so perfectly. Someone else had surmised that Luthor would come in to help clean up Metropolis possibly to try to get his hands on any Kryptonian tech (Zod's suit, parts of a ship etc.) What better way to retcon Luthor than into the younger head of a tech giant a la Google? 
Read my reply, and if you'd rather not hash out what I'm saying in public then I would genuinely be happy to explain why I understand the two movements as convergent in PMs.
It really kinda sucks not having the cash to travel. Maybe next time.
WOOO!
If it needs fixing up to support 3.x, the 2to3 tool works pretty well.
Also see Crawford v. Washington which somewhat undermines Maryland v. Craig.
I am the queen of simplicity and order!  Go through your mail as soon as you bring it in. Throw the junk mail away and set the bills on your desk so you will pay them sooner than later.  Limit (severely) the amount of knick knacks and framed photos you have out. Rotate them instead of displaying them all at the same time.   Leave some surfaces empty. Keep the dining table empty. Keep things like coffee makers and canisters off of the counter. 
&gt; But I would argue that is only for a small minority of the cargo that is transported on a daily basis
The Pangea theory would have certainly gained traction earlier.
Can't believe my screenreader said it instead of spelled it.
This is amazing! I say "is" because I'm eating for dinner with a side of cilantro rice right now! So freaking good! Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Edit: also, I used boneless thighs in pkace of breasts. Yum, yum.
Everyone knows fetuses aren't born gay, they're made gay through sorcery. 
Ok EA games. "All new incredible updated content!!!" ...adds one new thing that you barely notice. 
I have shiny shaymin 6iv 
posts like yours
Exactly how I reacted
your cheat sheet is only correct for the ISO settings, for aperture and shutter speed the scale is reversed for more light vs. less light.
Which is why we're taught to cross check at every intersection...
I'm so happy that you're happy. You look great.  I'm sorry that your ex couldn't handle it, but I'm sure anything that paradigm-shifting would be hard for anyone.  It's awesome that you have such a supportive employer. I've seen many trans friends struggle with employment.  I don't really have much to add to the discussion, but I wanted to add a little more love an support than just an upvote.
So you use control groups for the hero that has 2 units, but not for the hero with 4 units? I don't see your reasoning.
What do you mean not supposed to? He has tried to shut down Gitmo, but that takes money and congress controls the purse strings. As senator he voted to reauthorize it, so noone who voted for him for president should have been surprised by that. And if you look at his statements on the NSA he was consistent there. His problem was that Bush removed it from any sort of congressional oversight, not that we had surveillance programs. Obama said in a campaign speech "The FISA court works..." So again you guys can all feign surprise, but he really his change in stance is just the pragmatism he has always shown, and not a betrayal of his beliefs or campaign promises.
Sounds good to me.

[](/happytavi)All th way to the Quarter finals where you get thrashed by Messi's Argentina.
That's a pretty neat observation. I'll see what I can do tomorrow :) Thanks!
Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/aVTys2c.gif) okay? I'm kinda new to gif-making.
This link says literally nothing about maternity wards. Other areas of the hospital have lots of patients with infections, but maternity wards are only filled with healthy women. 
I want to know too. Personally I love the dude for his transparency, but can't help but wonder if he is fucking up Toronto politically.
Man, that's awesomely efficient. Nice job with that layout.
This definitely looks like it's an art district. Not WTF at all. X-post to /r/mildlyinteresting

Thanks! I really hope the horse eye makes it!
Technically, no, but she's not higher than me either. She would fall under HR/Office Admin while I'm under Operations/Sales. Respectively, I'm higher within my dept than she is in her's though.
[](/raritywhy)Oh god, the internet blocked access to your face!
I've streamed HBO GO in crystal clear HD from my phone to it. And when I say crystal clear, it's as if I've got the Blu-Ray disc in. When we have cleaning day, we cast Pandora to the Chromecast and route the music through the surround sound. Netflix is flawless. And if you have a laptop, you can get the [Chromecast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?hl=en) extension and send literally whatever is on your Chrome browser tab to your TV. Hulu Plus and YouTube also send over to the Chromecast exceptionally well.  If you've got an Android device, and you have synced your music on Google Play Music, which uses the cloud anyways, you can send your personal library to the device instead of Pandora and having ads. (Still waiting for Spotify mobile to be able to cast). I don't have Plex but it's a platform to keep all of your entertainment like movies and songs and what not all organized.   There are a few smaller apps you can cast with (there's a podcast one, and an app called Revision3 which is like a technology news and review app/service for free on the Play Store).  Overall, the amount of entertainment I've gotten from this little thing is incredible. From my computer I can send my Facebook feed to it, I could cast Reddit, or if I lived alone and felt like it I could cast porn straight to it. This thing is fucking awesome and probably one of my top 5 purchases of 2013.   Hope this gives you a bit of insight as to what you can do with it.
There were rulers in medieval Italy called doges. That word is pronounced dohj so that's probably why the Dogecoin founders pronounce it that way.  Why am I getting downvoted?

More or less yeah. That's about the long and short of it.
Nerd³ completes... or you know, just do more...i guess...
could it possibly set the world record for most attendees? Michigan Stadium is huge
Common straightforward way to increase the size of your collection. Also somewhat lazy. 
My only big objection is the spatula thing. You can get fine results with a spatula. Just learn to stir in a way that really moves the food around. Flipping is easier (IMO of course), more efficient, and saves a dish, but I don't think spatulas ruin anyone's food.
I could see that on a Banu Merchantman
Try to reload the game, i know it used to fix the replay bugs all the time it worked for me many times but not sure if this will solve your problem but try it anyway :P
This type of thinking assumes that accounts were placed correctly to begin with. I find it healthy that I receive higher skilled matches while I grind accounts up the ladder...   In response to OP, plat matches are far easier to carry than gold matches. Higher mmr begets far more predictable behavior and easier/more dominant snowballing. The best thing a player can do is ignore the division rating and be thankful for the tier of matches you're receiving, especially if it's above your current skill level. Climbing the ladder is something that requires a significant skill difference from your current mmr. Players that either play inconsistently or hover at a 50% win rate shouldn't be climbing. The system compensates by trying to find the upper and lower limits of a players skill. This can be easily represented by a wave type curve..... Troughs and peaks, my friend. 
Sent you a PM, something like that sounds real good, actually.
Also to OP: Every day, I see people who are 40+ years old, who have lost a lot of their teeth by not brushing and taking care of themselves. These people have regret over how it makes their teeth and smile look, they want to cover their mouths when they talk to me because they are ashamed of their teeth, and they usually can't do much about it because the cost of fixing their issues has gotten so high. These people would give anything to be back in your shoes, to be only 21 years old, with a second chance to practice good oral hygiene, to take care of their teeth, and to prevent a lot of self-inflicted misery. 20 or 30 years from now, do you want to be one of these people, or are you going to do something NOW to stop it, are you going to be stronger?
Let me clarify.  I read the news, I just don't have enough incentive to actually get involved.  That's the sort of comment that makes people dislike you, as an individual.
Or when I realize I forgot the Serious tag   e.g.: "[Discussion] does anybody here sail?"   "AWOL **SAIL!**" comments 
Going for the Seahawks but I'd say the Broncos will do it
I've got a whole box of cloned 6IV ditto on my pokemon black cart just waiting for pokemon bank to come online.  Planning to trade them for all the bank legendaries and X-exclusive megastones.
Waiting in line at King's Island for The Beast ride, talking to a stranger and friend about our respective vehicles when a very large woman out of nowhere chimes in...:  "I got a '99 Ford Escort!"  Annnnddd out of my mouth comes  "Surprised you can fit in it" We were in line. There was no place to go. It was weird.
It's for charity. Chill the fuck out
Best thing EA ever did was let me play mass effect on my ps3
...until Blizzard Dota comes out.
What is the name of the fallacy when someone accuses a false fallacy? I didn't see ad hominem argumentation fallacy nowhere Jack_125 text.  Anyway, to me your response count as appeal to authority logical fallacy, since you started your argument with *I see you are no idiot.*, then saying *I'm impressed PT taught you that* as it were a very sophisticated discussion resource that you know very well, and OP is almost in your level (well, he's no idiot), but since you identified and used Latin words OP must be wrong.
