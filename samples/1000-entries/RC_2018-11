It can be a symptom of another disorder: -are you depressed? Do you feel tired most of the time, sad, lonely, hopeless? -are you on any medication? Antidepressants are the most known libido killers, but there are more drugs that can cause libido loss. -stress -alcohol abuse -get a general evaluation by your GP.  Also there's a chance that you don't find your partner sexually attractive, or maybe being insecure about your body, insecurity about sexual preferences....

My brain works best when I get up when the sun gets up. It doesn't want to go to bed until a long time after the sun goes down. Getting up 2 hours earlier than the sun absolutely devastates my mental health because I'm continuously sleep deprived.  My last 2 years were spent in a zombie-like fog and I frequently fell asleep at my desk at ~2pm because of this.
Rubbish. They lost a semi not in group stages.

You do realize anyone can edit Wikipedia.  That guy hates Trump.  And Trump has done more for the nation of Israel than any other president.  His own daughter is Jewish as are his son in law and his grandchildren.  Some nut job doesn‚Äôt equate to the right, and you know it.

....it's a line from the show
It makes me sad to see people taken advantage off by their bosses.   My last boss was the most incredible dude.   He‚Äôd show up at noon and leave at 5-6. He didn‚Äôt care what I did as long as I got it done. We had excellent turn around times.  He was definitely a mentor to me. He saw that I did a good job and reciprocated in the best possible way. He bought me lunch and beer and invited me to his house often. We were homies.  My current boss is not the same, but at least he has an insane amount of respect for me. He has treated me as the professional that I feel I am and has given me a tremendous amount of responsibility and pays me to compensate for it, he has high expectations to match but he has never been disappointed in delays because he understands how difficult what we are doing is. I don‚Äôt clock in or out. I make my own hours but I often work 50 hours a week.  If you really feel like your boss is an asshole maybe you should seek better employment. Don‚Äôt feel that your value is only worth your biweekly paycheck.

*A shame indeed. Defeat tends to make the defeated much wiser, and humbler. Unless they're dead of course.*  With a snort that carried all the weight of, 'no fucking shit dumbass,' Juniper stuck close behind Ruka as they moved along. "So, you guys live here huh? It's a pretty big place. I'd ask what you do with all your time, but I'm guessing the answer is watch your brothers and study so you can inherit the throne. Which brings me to ask... If your mother is a goddess, and she won't ever die, why would you need to be groomed to take over?"  ---  Esteris gravely nodded. *Mortal life is recycled in our realm. Life becomes aether. Aether becomes life. Intrinsically linked. The self does not remain, but eventually, all that dies becomes reborn. Just not in any form they'd recognize. Or even be aware of. As far as I'm aware...* It made a chortling sound. *'Karma' does not exist.*  It's musing finished, Esteris put it's arms to it's sides once more. *But, you are not wrong; mortal life is fast and beautiful, but though they endure hardship, it, like their lives, end quickly.* It stopped then, realizing something. *...You think your life is some sort of twisted prank?

That sounds like a lengthy process.  
That's my whole point. Honestly, being a soldier means ultimately being there to deploy. I should have stated that like med pros if you're not green, then you're not deployable. I feel that HRT and deployments are non compatable. To me it's like if you were on insulin and had to deploy, that would be a no go.  Never switched on the trans PS. Still a shitbag for abandoning her responsibilities. I don't think trans people are inherently shitbags, but I feel that their situation in this line of work is in compatable with the Army life.  If you feel that I'm insulting you, well you wouldn't be the first. The take away:  - Soldiers should be present to deploy - If you are hurt, get better -If you really can't get better, consider an alternate line of work - Being trans does not equal you being a shitbag -Being trans means you have a preexisting condition -Yes I consider Gender Dysphoria a preexisting condition   Lastly, I think what you mean by inherent nature of being trans is the fact that being in the Army team means being an active participant in it. I do feel that being trans means you are not all there. Because, again, I consider trans a preexisting condition that does not up and resolve itself.

First off, where in PA are you?  Secondly, I listed some in my other reply, but if you want something with a bit of wiggle room and the ability to grow I'm going to suggest a setup that isn't a kit, but is battle tested.  For the mod, an IStick Pico. Any model is fine (except the dual). The 25 is more common than the OG, but the OG can be found pretty cheaply.  For the tank, a Nautilus 2 if you want MTL, a Super Tank Mini if you want DL.  Both are older, but coils are abundant for either tank. The STM is Atlantis compatible, so almost any coil in that class should work.  You can charge via USB with the Pico, I personally would recommend getting a second 18650 battery and an external charger. Less downtime. I also would never recommend charging it while you sleep.  If you want an internal battery mod, look at Innokin's offerings. They are the gold standard with internal battery mods. I will say I do like the Voopoo Drag Mini, but I haven't had it long enough to really recommend it. 
Some may still be around, I don't believe the Eddie eagle program is still around? Schools seem to think the only response to anything slightly dangerous is to not do it at all.. abstinence only education, DARE program was a complete failure, if you see a gun find an adult.. sure that's great for a 5 year old but a teenager should know gun safety if their parents haven't taught them yet. Too many kids with mental health issues and over medication. Kids stressed about bully's, grades, college, and even politics.. 10 year olds crying because Trump won, shame on those parents. 
Side note you have to die to damage if you run out of cards it doesn't change your health.
Had a similar problem earlier today while navigating on autopilot. I was in a dedicated exit lane, music going, didn‚Äôt think I needed to confirm the exit. It immediately tripped up, veered left and right to maintain position in the exiting lane. As soon as it wigged out, I took over and the music cut for about 5 minutes. It still showed the station as playing, volume controls worked, screen was responsive, but no audio. 
This is the reason I love making alliances. Betryal and civil wars break up who you normally fight.

Thank you! I legit just had a kid ask me if I'm a fortnite character. I could not hold back from laughing.
&gt;1. How does the fact that someone can change their gender affect you?   That's a long list. It changes how I am expected to treat people. It changes who can and cannot be drafted (or avoid being drafted). It changes who can and cannot apply for many scholarships, grants, and the like. Etc.  &gt;2. I don't believe for a second that you understand all laws, and besides, no laws are being changed, just definitions are being expanded. Which is different.  Believe what you like. And plenty of people are advocating for changes in law on this issue. Interestingly, many definitions are enshrined in the law.

Wow... it sucks how ungrateful children are. My parents suck. My mom is an overprotective, dramatic, and needs control. My dad is a narcissist. Nonetheless, they gave me everything they had.

I never feel bad about helping them... ever.

It isn't a fix, it's more like a band-aid, a shitty off brand band-aid.  To get the bounties to get the cores you have to grind another material, ghost fragments.  Sure they bumped the number up to 20 but that's a LOT of public events and lost sector repeating.  So you grind, to grind, to maybe infuse, oh wait you need 25 baryon boughs, or 25 seeds (I hate this one personally), or 25 alkalids or 500 dragon dongs.  The point is, this is all a massive grind scheme and people are arguing about what they were named (hah!) and how scarce.  They're STILL scarce and require more work to get instead of just hoping you get one from a deconstruct.  I bet their metrics are based on player log in time and activity.  That is the only logical conclusion I can come to for such an asinine and infuriating patently transparent carrot before the horse grind bullshit ripped straight out of a damned NC Soft korean mmorpg scheme.

I liked The Weather Channel's local forecasts better in the 90's than now. I really liked the Muzak, and the little animated weather icons. (I used to wait for it to come on...and if r/nostalgia is anything to go by, I'm not the only one!)   Also, trick-or-treating. When I was a kid, there was none of this "trunk-or-treat" nonsense. We actually rang doorbells. It was a way to meet the neighbors, and build community. (Even if it wasn't like my parents' day, where some of those neighbors would invite you in for candy apples, donuts, cider, and whatnot.) And some of the older kids would go out with their younger siblings...without supervision!

Important to note that the employer can only leave the contract with zero consequence ***if they don't give a reason for it***. A lot of employers mess up by giving an official reason why someone has been let go, and can still be pegged with an unlawful firing.   For instance: Racist manager fires a black man with no comments? He's fine.  Racist manager fires a black man while mentioning that he doesn't like working with black men? That's illegal.

Well, Ontario isn't exactly the educational standard by which the rest of the provinces follow if Grade 13 serves at all as an example.  I'm not sure about the maritimes, but for the western provinces there's only 1 year of kindergarten at age 5.  Alberta has a public pre-k for ESL kids, but that's it as far as I can tell.  Quebec has pre-k in a few schools across the province, but isn't universal.  From what I googled before posting (but didn't link), some provinces will have the parents pay out of pocket for preschool and then give subsidies based on income rather than it being a universal benefit paid for with taxes.  The feds are spending beaucoup dollars to have the provinces set up more early education / child care solutions, but that's again not a universal program (something that Paul Martin campaigned on back in 2004 or so).

I wouldn't target just anyone. Even if you're prospecting, you'll still want a target audience and demographics. Think of the users who fill out surveys for money.  They'll be a certain age group with very low to no income right? I would at least start there with prospecting then remarketing and build lookalike audience on the results. You'll start to learn more about who users whose sites as you go.

It would be interesting to see your harvest vs. what comes in a standard jar of saffron one might buy at the Safeway, e.g. Spice Island.  It looks to me like what you have here might be half the quantity of what is sold in a jar, a jar which may cost $10 or more.   Forget the other posts talking about wholesale prices per pound... it's the price the common man has to pay at the market that is relevant.
yea i dunno wtf these threads are about, soda's average viewership is 30k
If that's true then that's really impressive. Do you still go for elites or do you just skip the card if you have to go for elites in act 1?  I've considered it bad most of the time because I'd think you'd need like 4-5 camfires and 0 elites to get enough upgrades on this card. Which is very rare from my experience and even then just upgrading your regular cards seems better.

&gt; Most of his character isn't specific to Indians, it's true of immigrants in general: &gt; * Working long hours at menial jobs? Check. &gt; * Thick accent in English? Check. &gt; * Hard-for-locals-to-pronounce name? Check.  Sure if you scope backwards it applies to lots of things. But he was designed specifically to target Indian stereotypes.  Menial job? Sure. Convenience store? Pretty classically indian immigrants.  Thick accent? Yeah, lots of immigrants. Super exaggerated not realistic indian accent? Pretty specific there too.  Hard to pronounce name? Fair. Nahasapeemapetilon? Literally a mash up of one of the writer's Indian friend's name.   &gt;The character of Apu could have been Farsi or Moroccan or Laotian and not much would have changed  Except those people aren't associated with at least half of the specifics of Apu's character. He is 100% an Indian stereotype, and that's best exemplified by the fact that INDIAN PEOPLE were the ones upset by him. If they weren't specific stereotypes, why would it bother them? If you change his race but leave everything else, he doesn't make sense. Thus he's clearly meant to be a joke about Indians.   Also (and please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), I believe Farsi is a dialect of the Persian people. I am not aware of people identifying as Farsi.

According the to folks at TrainerRoad, virtual power is pretty internally consistent so long as the set up is consistent (like you said). If you use TR, I believe they have a built in virtual power meter as well. I'm not sure how it will compare to Suunto's app, so you may want to do all of the testing TR suggests to make sure all of the variables are consistent.   Obviously, it won't be comparable to other people's power but that doesn't really matter. Most power meters have external variability so comparing power from person to person isn't even super accurate. 
&gt; Its unlikely that there will ever be a single best philosophy for humanity.  Super true.  it's a kind of degenerate state.  &gt; But at least, the study of philosophy, which usually includes the recognition that there are other worldviews, different interpretations and perspectives, and the ability to critically examine your own opinions, views and biases, all massively improves your chances of becoming a decent person.  Also super true.  Realistically speaking, though, critically examining your own opinions, views and biases is *really fuckin hard*, and not everyone can do it.  That's where the right religion comes in.  It's not much different than parenting (I imagine, I have no kids).  There's no manual for parenting, but there's a lot of different philosophies, and no one knows which one is right.  And, eventually, all parents get tired of questions and say "BECAUSE I TOLD YOU TO".  Some kids grow up and realize that parents don't know it all.  Some never figure it out.
If people are doing this, I make it a point to lose the game. lmao

Deborah Ann Woll's [The Witch of Briarcleft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGfdJW_py7E)  during the Stream of Many Eyes is the only actual D&amp;D game I know of that he plays in.

Which is a worse outcome, giving info so people can pick and choose matches based on their own preferences or continually getting one-and-done's and going back to matchmaking until you find someone you find someone of comperable skill.

Fair enough.  I get the first part of your statement, lol.  It's hard to call yourself an anime fan without being at least a little bit numb to fan-service.

A few years ago I was at a sleepover with about ten ladies aged 21-31 and everyone but one person had brought their lifelong stuffed animal friend. Since then I have had no shame. If I didn't have a stuffed animal I'd be hugging a pillow because it feels good to have my arms supported, so I might as well hug something cute and soft that I have an attachment to and comforts me when I've had a bad day or have bad dreams.  I have my childhood stuffed animal but I also recently got a big bear and named it Harold.

Banks are the ones financing movies in Hollywood and they don't want to lose money and they're targeting people outside of North America as well and specially with the Asian markets being so hungry for these movies we will constantly see these tested and tried ideas. That's why a lot of films are getting backed by Chinese investors like Wanda group.  Another issue it isn't the fault of Hollywood, people are paying for these sequels and remakes and adaptations on video games and etc..   If more people paid to watch original movies then we would get more enjoyable and newer movie ideas.   If you look at the list of movies that are being made, it's all Disney dominant with comic books such as Marvel behind it and don't get me started on how they're milking star wars.  Another idea that is being thrown onto the movies ; It's classics like ghost busters being replaced with an all female cast, why can't we have an original script with an all female cast that is totally different than their all male cast counterparts?   Because $   Quality of production and acting has gone higher but creativity and story telling has been completely overlooked, we get great actors like Keanu Reeves being typecast into the same character because investors are afraid to do something new and don't want to lose their money.   The next set of ground breaking movies are coming from outside of Hollywood and it's coming from Europe and Asia.

I found LittleBigPlanet 3 lacked the magic of the first two games. Maybe I'd outgrown the series, or maybe the creation tools just got too advanced for me. Or it could have been the bugs in LittleBigPlanet 3's single player content that prevented me from finishing levels and soured me on the flawless experience I had with the first two (which, granted, were late rather than day one buys like LBP3, so bugs had been ironed out).  Either way, LBP3 was an underwhelming experience for me and even has me doubting that Dreams can live up to its expectations.  But if they announce a LittleBigPlanet Karting / Modnation Racers crossover game I'm so in. Or just add LBPK with a tunnel brush. Still don't know why they didn't allow tunnels through mountains in LBPK when Modnation did it so well.
Well yeah. Since you still haven't provided the evidence that you promised re: family separation being an Obama policy (I'm assuming because none exists), the conversation is basically over.   What else are we supposed to do but point out your unintentional irony?

Granted. You reach your hand into your pocket expecting ten $100 bills and pull out your hand to see that your wrist is now connected to $1000 dollars and there is no hand in sight. You are exacerbated as you look to your other hand that is resting in your pocket with your phone, you pull it out to see an amputation at your wrist and a couple more hundred dollar bills attached there. You forgot to wish your hand would come out with the money.

When I know something, I can make the other person feel bad or stupid with how I tell them. I actually really try not to, but with autism I say everything very factually and blunt, so sometimes it must come across like "duh" when I actually what it to be more like "did you know" :(

Hi jezza
If you're a manager where you have to schedule people, I guess.  If you dont *have* to have coverage then its just pointless micromanaging.  If I'm "scheduled" for 8-5 and I work 7-4 why do you care?
Now ive stagnated at that level haha. I think what helped was getting the bent arm lsit to handstand. It helped get me transitionary exposure to the position. It also helped with my headstand push ups and handstand holds and kick ups. Its something i would recomend if you havent learnt already.
Golden Boy don't have many headiliners so might as well use him the once they can at least. Plus they are probably going out of the way to treat him well so he remembers when his deal with Zanfer ends. For now he's going to ESPN though. Zanfer doesn't HAVE to do that, but they might as well as be a branch of Top Rank at this point.
I‚Äôm on mobile so I can‚Äôt easily find the source right now, but I believe someone at Sega of America has confirmed that all Sega Ages titles will enjoy essentially simultaneous US and JP releases.   I don‚Äôt recall Sega of America actually announcing the first two Sega Ages releases either. They just showed up on the eShop very soon after the JP release. I‚Äôd guess we‚Äôll see Phantasy Star tomorrow.

I'm disappointed by the idea of it being done via legislation, but I personally think that's the future of the industry. Once consumers get comfortable with autonomous vehicles, I think consumer demand for owning their own vehicles will drop like a rock.  As that dwindles, ride-shares will drive a signifigant portion of consumer auto sales, and at that point it just makes sense for manufacturers to operate their own fleets.
I wonder how many people on this board remember this, it's so long ago now.  It's awesome how younger fans today can have this ridiculous access to wrestling history.   When I was 18, in 1996, I wish I had a way to consume everything that was going on in pro wrestling in the 70s.

You are missing Sorin. Aside from the dragons he is the oldest of the Planeswalkers. He predates Urza by 5k years and was Nahiri's mentor. She would be 2nd after him.  On Nixilis is pretty powerful, as most oldwalkers are. I would put him in competition with Garruk if not stronger.   Nissa also has access to leyline magic and was able to channel the mana of Zendikar itself. She is probably the strongest of the new-walkers.

No I believe rigging a primary is a major issue because that is a direct challenge to the right to vote in our country. And if either does, those who did it should be arrested.   I‚Äôm all for the government having entities that they run, such as schools and public lands in order to ensure free speech is allowed and continues.

 &gt;*Couple* is easier to quantify than *few*.  Your point being?  &gt;I don't recall arguing about the definition of "a few" in previous posts. Where precisely is it suggested that I didn't read it properly?  Your whole argument was that I told OP something they already knew. You stated they knew they should be spending 35 hours a week looking for a job. OP stated they were only spending a few hours a day. Let me guess, now you‚Äôll try and argue that a few hours is 35 hours a week.  &gt;The next quote from you was very predictable.  Yes, because it‚Äôs quite clear to both of us.  &gt;Repeating what I said before, you cannot use anything I posted to you after you wrote "Ah, as I expected, professional victim."  Ok, so once a hypothesis is stated you can‚Äôt use supporting evidence as it becomes available?  &gt;but you need to explain all this supposed evidence within the context of medical symptoms.  I thought we agreed that it‚Äôs not my job, or did you forget? Come on, stop with the begging, it‚Äôs getting embarrassing now.

BR skins clip a little with some dances too, especially the astronauts and Durr Burger/Tomatohead, so there's literally no reason not to do this, but no, they're too busy fucking up the chat instead.
We've only got a housing crisis in vancouver and the GTA. apart from that being the second largest country we've got loads and loads of room.   Canadians have the highest rate of university degrees among its population so they choose to work higher payed jobs. most low income jobs like fast food jobs are filled with teenagers that quit after a couple months. we could really use immigrants to fill that gap, allowing for a better functioning country.  Idk where you live but in Canada, we're not anywhere close to a automation revolution.   you're obviously not canadian so just want to respectfully ask you not to assume about a country you don't know about.

He‚Äôs deaf and very stupid, and the humane society people said I was the first person who had shown any interest in 3 whole weeks. They named him Trip. He doesn‚Äôt meow like a normal cat and he‚Äôs so uncoordinated that he can never catch the ribbon when you play with him.   They brought him into an observation room with me and the rest of my family the 2nd time I visited, the day I would bring him home, and the door had a window on it. He jumped up and hung from the barely-there ledge to look out the window.   The first day he was home he caught sight of this badger plush toy we had and he freaked the fuck out.  He ate some string and had to get surgery a few months ago, which I‚Äôm still paying off but he‚Äôs worth it.   Oh also he‚Äôs gay. He is an incredibly gay-for-human-men cat. He follows my sister‚Äôs boyfriend and my boyfriend around the house whenever they are over, climbing onto their laps the second they sit down. 
What the heck does this girl offer you that you would willingly put up with this?   She made all these choices to cheat, blames you for it, and is making you do the "pick me" dance.   Plus who is to say she will not simply do the same thing in the future?   Do you want to have to wonder who's child you are raising?   Or what co-worker she is sleeping with on a work trip?   You have all of your adult life ahead of you, you can do far better.

Life in prison has actually been found to be much cheaper than the death penalty. Due to the increased security of death row and the huge amount of legal fees from tying up the courtrooms with appeals, the cost of killing a death row inmate will actually be more by the time the deed is done. Unless the government were to expedite the death penalty process, but then you run the risk of killing the innocent, which is already something that happens today albeit very rarely.  Here's a Forbe's article that delves more into the details about it. https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2014/05/01/considering-the-death-penalty-your-tax-dollars-at-work/#3ebfe914664b

&gt; I just like getting people to examine their beliefs and remind them that the world isn‚Äôt always black and white.  Most of the time, it is black and white though. There's nothing wrong with seeing things according to a firm belief system, as this has worked out well throughout most of mankind's history. Being contrarian can also lead to not having any true beliefs on your own.

Probably true  I'm the only one who's in my office full time (we have a lot of people who work on site and come in and out) so the way I justify it is that I don't BS with coworkers during the day, in my mind this reelected all those wasted hours.  At the end of the day I get my work done, although I probably (definitely) did less than I should have today
&gt;Thank goodness very few companies operate on pure capitalism.   I don't think you understand what capitalism is, if you say that. The only reason a company exists is to maximize profit for ownership, no matter how many employees' lives they have to ruin or babies they have to throw into the wood-chipper. Every dollar they pay you is one less dollar in profit for ownership. That's the entire basis of capitalism.

I was EXACTLY like this at 19. I went to a California state school for a year and dropped out because I could not get myself to focus on any class and had absolutely no motivation what so ever, even though I wanted to succeed. I tried two different community colleges over the course of 3 years, but ended up dropping each after the first semester. I never knew my issue was ADHD until very very recently, and I'm sure if I had gotten the help I needed I could potentially have graduated with a degree. I'm now 26 and am just finishing up a 1 year intensive program on UI/UX Design, with hopes of finding a job soon. I am still waiting on a diagnoses and am not on medication, but I plan on taking it if I get the diagnoses.   &amp;#x200B;  Just know you are not at all alone, and you should never feel guilty because of your ADHD. I've lived my entire life feeling guilty for how I am, and am just now getting to a better place mentally. Please please try and get the help from a psychiatrist! I'm so bummed I didn't understand ADD/ADHD back when I was in school, if I had I feel like things could have turned out much differently for me.

Here's my workflow for a typical /r/nfl thread now:  &amp;#x200B;  Click comments link (because almost everything linked here is a fucking twitter link with little backing info) hoping for some depth.  Skim top reply for text contained in the twitter post; if it exists, continue to next thread, skipping that comment and all replies to it.  Usually, the next one is the same thing, so I have to keep skipping until I get to something meaty. I really don't care if people are making these low-effort meme comments, it's just sad that they are the top content in every thread now.

I think it's funny so many people so far have assumed "clean air, clean water and wide open space" means suburbia. Suburbia has none of these things.  I lived in the Mission Bay and the Tenderloin in SF, San Mateo, Sausalito and the Presidio. By all means, most of the places I've lived would be considered great places to live by people who like city or suburban living. I felt trapped. Too many people around, no space for my side projects (I like to build things in my spare time).   Now that I think about it, I'm probably not representative of most people. I'm a true introvert who needs his solitude. From what I understand, that's fairly rare. Most people like being around other people all the time. The more people the better.  Another factor at work here is I grew up in a small community with a lot of relatives nearby. For whatever reason, my quality of life always seems to be better when I'm living near that community and my family, even when it makes it more difficult to make a living.

Obviously that's the best gambling. When ESPN Classic first started, my roommate and I bet on a 1984 Dr, J/Magic Johnson NBA Finals game after we both swore that we didn't know the outcome of the game.  Also great betting- sumo wrestling, lumberjack olympics, and hunting dog competitions. There were a couple years that Doyle Brunson and Stuey Ungar booked each others action.  The peak of degeneracy.

Green has a lot of very cheap ways to search for and put into play a Craterhoof. there are plenty of other spells that does its effect for budget, but Craterhoof being a creature makes it so much more easy to fetch in green.  You can just go grab it with effects like \[\[birthing pod\]\] or \[\[eldritch evolution\]\] and win.

What‚Äôs this from
Well, if you cap out your conquest completely.   Basically, each week this season we were able to earn a piece. If you are just now starting, you are still able to earn EVERY piece we have earned but you just need to do the games. You will get the 370 item boost but it‚Äôs the most recent item, so if you haven‚Äôt been doing your weekly games you have like 4500 conquest to farm in total.  Another important fact when farming up on an alt, once that bar hits 500, you need to go turn in that ‚Äúquest‚Äù to get that item. This is important because you don‚Äôt earn any more conquest UNTIL you turn it in.

Not who you responded to. It certainly isn't true to say that an at will contract can't be breached. It is true that in this case, a change in the terms of the 401k plan is not a breach of that contract, at least given the information we have so far.

Song of Ice and Fire, The Mistborn series, the Red Rising series are all good fantasy series. If you don't mind something that's a little more sci-fi, I highly recommend the Three Body Problem series. It's a sci-fi trilogy that feels like an epic fantasy and is a strong contender for my favorite series. it's also worth looking at the Discworld series. The books are always funny and soulful, they're pretty light easy reads, and there are like a jillion of them. 
An interim clearance is granted by your local security liaison based on a preliminary review of your SF86. The waiver is typically something signed by your supervisor or supervising office that says they are allowing you to work in the office while your final clearance is adjudicated.   It's fairly typically with new hires into the government, and allows people to start while the lengthy clearance process continues. I've seen people on an interim clearance for 6 to 12 months depending on if it's secret or TS. It comes with restrictions regarding what material you can handle, but most offices would rather you start and learn in the intervening months.   Based on what you said my guess is the office rarely handles classified material, and the clearance is just a standard practice for all employees.

The solution goes in the direction of creating unions between countries that share the same rules (like the EU). But it seems that the wealthy are fighting it back by convincing impressionable people everywhere to fight against ‚Äúglobalism‚Äù and become more nationalistic. It has already worked in the US, England, Russia, Brazil and it is also working in other countries where right wing parties are getting more support (like AfD in Germany).   It‚Äôs a great plan, really. The rich keep enjoying the freedom and immunity of having the whole world at their fingertips and the common folk fight to increase borders and fight each other down here.  In the end, the 90% keeps getting robbed and the rich keep getting away with it.
Yeah, I mean because of how much hes asking for it
Because rich people aren‚Äôt subjected to the same societal pressures to conform as the rest of us.

yea that is my thinking also. IT seems we are getting sasoono  kurama.  Maybe he will be invincible until   sasoono goes down?   I was thinking  that we will be fighting that slug queen and she would heal herself of all debufs.   Nature resistances   have no effect on this   count down damage.  I think they will nerf it from  taking 100%  of health  to about   20% maybe 33%. Even if they would nerf it to 50% , that would just mean an extra 30sec that the boss is alive.  THey were planning for this c4.  Shizune's ultimate  is a direct counter to it,  so they must be thinking of something.  Even, if the next 3 bosses are somehow imune to it .   That is 9 months-  if each 3x in a row.

An Evansville fan would support Mizzou in this because it is a bad look for Evansville to deny a transfer waiver for a player leaving after the coach is fired. The funny thing is that Evansville‚Äôs main fan board has been making disturbing if not aggressive claims that Dru Smith practically belongs to them. He‚Äôs an Evansville kid so obviously emotions run high when he decided to transfer. But that doesn‚Äôt make it right to deny him the right to play this year rather than next year and the year after. It‚Äôs an absurd situation in which adults are treating kids as property and exerting control and power inappropriately. Recruiting for Evansville will be hurt by this.

Months late, but what the hell. Driving down I-5 about an hour or so from Sacramento when my family's car gets a flat tire. Sort of the middle of nowhere. Called AAA, said they were going to be a long time, so me and my mom started to head towards the nearest gas station about three quarters of a mile away or so (turned out the place was closed but that's another story). We start walking when all of a sudden, this truck comes toward us off this frontage road next to the freeway. Can't remember what he exactly said at first, but I do remember after asking us whether we needed help, he said "Do you trust me?" Sounds terrible out-of-context, but we did. He drove back and helped my dad change the flat to the spare my dad conveniently filled up for once right before we went on the trip. Helped out and then drove the opposite way that he was originally going, which threw us all off a little bit. My mom claims he must have been an an angel, personally not sure, but very odd overall.

It is obvious to you that no one who would brew coffee is or would be awake at this hour.  You wrap your bathrobe around yourself, or put on your slippers, or pull on your boxers -- whatever it is you do to get ready to face the day.  Chris Osgood is in your living room, on your couch, drinking a steaming cup of joe.  "Coffee's on," Chris says, smiling there on your couch with his perfectly coiffed hair.

Right now I perma ban Sion in soloQ because people are doing the inting Sion. He isn't the worst matchups, but difference with Garen and Sion is that Sion is just a tank. He builds titanic and just pushes, and when he is with his team he can be very annoying this his slows and cc. If your asking what you build against a Sion, if he is ahead BC can be good to counter his tankyness, if he goes damage for some reason rush DMP instead, but when playing Garen you have more kill pressure and movement speed. How I would build against Sion is phase rush as rune because slow resis is good, bami (don't get if you don't have phase), swifties, DMP, BC, steraks. You can adjust the build to fit your playstyle like grasp, but I rush swifties because his slows are extremely annoying, get unflinching if you can and try and abuse him before first back.

Sometimes I think we overestimate how much of a role we have in other people's lives. If you're worried that people at work are avoiding you or think you're 'weird', you might be projecting that anxiety onto other people when you talk to them, or it could affect your body language.   Are you sure they were laughing about you? Honestly, whenever I hear two people laughing a distance away from me I STILL jump to conclusions and think that they're laughing at me, even if I know logically they don't even know me.  If these people are acting snotty then I'd say screw em. Act professional and friendly, but don't let it get to you. That kind of behavior is honestly like junior high levels of maturity, but sadly I think a lot of people never grow out of the cliquey way we acted around that age.  Try to be more of an active listener too. People usually love to talk about themselves. If someone mentions they did BLAH over the weekend, or that they're interested in BLAH, ask them a question about it. That might jump start a conversation.  Uh.. hope this was some help? I kinda just rambled.
WGU is heavily frowned upon by some HR idiots. It has the same reputation as University of Phoenix. Sadly, they have a solid program. 
In my case antidepressants really help me. I have tried a few different ones and found that venlafaxine help me the most by reducing the huge variations and extremes in my mood. I feel like I can cope with things better when I'm on them and I'm generally a nicer person to be around. If you haven't tried them and are open to the idea, I would recommend trying them but don't be surprised if it takes a while to find the ones that work best for you

Exactly. If you're a genuine practitioner you're fine. It's faking it that's illegal.  I mean, I'd be perfectly fine with rolling this into our existing fraud laws. Ideally they could also go after faith healers. I know those are more of a US thing, but it happens here too.

The people doing that toxic stuff in Quickplay are amateurs. They need to take their trash talk to the next level. I go into gambit with my NF and send hate mail to people I repeatedly invade. I dont send mail in quickplay but if I three tap you, you best believe you are going to get dabbed on. Just boom, boom, boom, DAB and onto the next victim. Do this enough and you dont even have to send hate mail. It will come to you. And when you get it, never reply, just respond with smug PS4 emotes to anything they say. Trust me it will infuriate them more than anything you could respond with. Plus you can spam these so goddamn fast.  &amp;#x200B;  My absolute, 100% favorite thing to do though is go into competitive solo. Inevitably when you run into teams and beat them, you kindly offer them assistance and offer to play with them. When they respond 'wow yes we could use the help', then you simply reply 'jk you suck' and block them asap. Bonus points if you then requeue and beat them again.

Then you should expect an uprising filled with young kids that will no longer be fooled very soon, young stud. I felt like no one could fool me, so I struggled to listen to some morons growing up. You might call me troubled. My creator would call me too enlightened to care.   I could see how gaining wisdom through "shared" experiences could lead one to be fooled less, but so what? So could being born wealthy. Or having wealthy internal riches - I was raised very well. It gave me an incredible head start on many old people. Age is still just a number. Our ability to not be fooled was passed down our bloodline. Thankfully, mine is pretty solid.   If anything, the older you get, the less likely you are to fool me, because most knowledge is all passed down through the bloodline, I believe. As time moves on, our grand parents learned that they were fooled. So did our parents. And so on... Many become irate, and pass on their views to their youth as they vent their frustrations aloud. As more and more people struggle, so will their views of the world around them, and how much it sucks..  Take the police, for example. They can still fool old people. But they can't fool the informed youth with the digital age at their disposal   Perceive what you will..   Oh, and yeah.. I can still easily be fooled. Just not as much as a blind deaf older person. Sometimes even pride will do that to a person.

I hung out with Katie Adkins (the girl that gets chased) We went fishing on my friends boat, and she was really rude. Like super mean to everyone. She kept being rude, so i started singing too many cooks. Everyone joined in, and she shut right up.

I can't speak to the completed program because I haven't run it all the way through but I've done the inverted juggernaut 10s and 8s waves and found them just fine.  I was on a slight deficit at the time.  The program is autoregulated both daily (how hard do you push an AMRAP) and over cycles (your TM is never above 95% of your actual max).  So it won't be overly demanding on a cut.  I mean obviously there are inherent limitations to the extent and degree of strength and muscle gain during a cut, but those limitations are probably highly dependent on the specific person so there is no real general guidance other than to get on a program that you can push hard if you can, or back off a bit if your fatigue is building up too much.

My crush in high school came out as bi, and she told me that she'd totally date me if I was a guy. I was estatic... Until I was like, wait... But you're bi?  She eventually discovered that she was into butch women, and not bi at all. And I look pretty feminine, although not for lack of trying. Ended up coming out as trans later, so it was a mess all around, really.

10, are you single?
I don't think that we can open this door yet.
Yeah, I've done coke and ecstasy a few times and never had any problems, but for both of those my ex-boyfriend just couldn't do anything, even if he took viagra along with them. Some people just have more of this collateral effect than others, I guess. Nowadays I'm kind of over cocaine though, so I don't think I'll ever have actual sex while under its influence.
I know what i said. It's not based on a false understanding of the history. There's more history than just AP1 cars here. You are conveniently ignoring everything *after* AP1 to make your point. Since AP1 was officially dropped from support, any current plans for the cars do not apply to AP1 in any scenario and that one blip in Tesla's overall history doesn't negate that overall they do get their shit done. That's all i'm saying. It makes sense AP1 would be dropped too because AP1 is MobileEye cars and they don't work with Tesla anymore. It's an unique circumstance for AP1 cars that makes the fact that AP1 probably not see future updates not count as "oh look Tesla doesn't deliver on their promises" in my opinion. If that partnership was still intact, they'd have likely got the updates to that car and things with Tesla in general would be on a quite different track. But that isn't the case.
Because rape of women has been going on the whole time anyway. The question of whether the person doing the raping is a migrant or a citizen really doesn't make the issue any better or worse.  But now suddenly everybody is so aghast at those *migrants* raping *our* women. That's just rhetoric.   Same as the facebook friends who feel that there's no possible housing for refugees, what with so many veterans already not having housing! Except they never once worried about the homeless veterans before those became a good strawman to deny housing to refugees.   So let's talk about the issue of rape, and let's try to protect potential victims of it. But so long as you want to make it out to be an issue with migrant men, that ignores the actual reality of the issue. To me it then sounds like the issue is not women getting raped, but rather that women are getting raped by brown men instead of men you sympathize with. 
Neat idea 
Interesting. I'm an American of English/Dutch heritage. My grandfather (fully English) I identified that as a Christmas carol his parents (who emigrated) would sing.

Here's an idea I was playing with a while back to answer your question about why an innate gender identity exists from an evolutionary perspective.  Human development depends on a whole host of learned behaviors. Socialization, or the process of acquiring the skills to navigate a culture successfully based on it's rules and roles, is slow. Any genetic advantage boys or girls can have in speeding up the process of socialization will be advantageous to them. I'm thinking of Outliers, by Malcolm Gladwell. A key concept in his book was that early advantages that kids have can mean the difference between becoming an NHL hockey player or topping out in pee wee hockey. So, if people(who are stuck in a system of socialization, for better or worse) had some genetic advantage that allowed them to socialize faster than having a pure blank slate, it could be a huge advantage. That's what a gender core could do. It could be like a gender compass that directs kids early on towards certain behaviors and tendencies, effectively causing kids to specialize in the areas that would most benefit them in a gendered culture. Now, would that gender core be something the child or adult would be aware of? No. It would manifest as indistinct from personality. It would be fully embedded in their self structure. However, in the off chance that the gender core was misaligned with their biological sex, suddenly the presence of it would be abundantly obvious. Their inner compass would be pointing in opposition to the gendered socialization that would most benefit them(Again, in a gendered world). In fact, the misalignment would be distressing. It would have the opposite effect of speeding up socialization. It would distort and confuse them at all stages of development, because the inner compass bearing would be pointing in the exact opposite direction than the one that would benefit them. It would cause immense turmoil, until they found a way to align their inner compass with the outer influences.  Just an idea.

Her face is kinda Trissy. As long as the costume and wig will work I think she'd be a fine Triss.  But yeah, she's certainly not an "obviously Triss, perfect casting!" type of role. She's a "we'll wait to see if her acting makes up for it" type, when it comes to adaption accuracy. I have hopes that she brings something special to the role in her acting- her and especially Anya who to an even greater extent is not an obvious Yennefer.

Adderall makes physiological changes to your body, so you 1000% should definitely taper your dosage like your doctor suggested. Also, it‚Äôs common for people who take adderall 5+ days a week to take it every day because its effects on your mood could make you feel unstable with the sudden swings that it‚Äôs better to be consistent.  Living off adderall after being on it most of your life will be dramatic even after you get through withdrawal. And you will feel like you have a completely different personality. It will be helpful to talk to a therapist through it, but barring that, you should keep in mind that you are a changeable person, and you don‚Äôt have a singular, inflexible identity. There‚Äôs no such thing as the ‚Äúreal‚Äù you, just who you are at this moment in time. The changes you notice are not inherently bad, just different. 
My belief is that at the end of the day developing a close friendship really comes down to the hours.  This realization came to me when I realized my closest friends were ex-roommates and coworkers, and that the strength of friendship roughly correlated to how far away someone lives and for how long.  To truly get to know someone you just have to spend a lot of time with them.  This doesn't diminish those friendships!  Rather, I see it as a road map for making friends as an adult: if you meet someone, and you get along, and you want to improve the friendship, spend as much time with them as you can.

**Centuria: Age of Rediscovery**  &amp;#x200B;  Sure, I could mention the airships... but no, I'm going to instead talk about the Sigil Writers. They play an important role in the **Age of Rediscovery** and the **End of Rediscovery/Arrival.**  &amp;#x200B;  **C &amp; K Flying Bar Sigilwriter**  This remarkable piece of magitech is the machine that coined the term sigilwriter and set the standard for what they could do. Capable of receiving approximately 70 different characters and basic commands and a top speed of 50 words per minute, these machines became the favorite of well to do explorers and governments alike. At the height of their use, C &amp; K estimated that one sigilwriter sold every minute. Using a tune-able sigil circuit at the heart of the machine, it allowed a near instantaneous means of communications across Centuria. The flying bar is the system that reads the sigil and sets it for use. The flying bar also gives the machine its distinctive sound.  The only requirement to operate the machine is a suitable electrical power-supply to run the mechanical systems and to excite the sigil.  Various attachments were available for purchase, most notably the paper tape punch and reader. These proved invaluable for record keeping and broadcasting prerecorded messages. (This becomes a plot point during the Age of Rediscovery.) Further, C &amp; K sold a line of these machines, from a basic unit that had no options to a ‚Äòdeluxe‚Äô model with all the options. A special version called the Traveller was well suited for use in vehicles and sold well.  However, a quirk of the system was exposed when the human generation ships took up orbit around Centuria prior to landing. The sigilwriters would start up automatically, (if they could, that was an option) print gibberish on the page and behave erratically. The more advanced machines were more prone to erratic behavior, the simpler machines seemed to be somewhat immune, although that did not stop their gibberish text and random line feeds. Turns out, the sigilwriters had somehow picked up on the human ship's radio emissions and were trying to type it out.  Sigilwriters have fallen out of use for normal day to day communications as electronics could do more, were smaller and consumed less power. The sigilwriter lives on in a computer-controlled sigil circuit, allowing secured point to point communications, ironically still using the flying bar method for interacting with the sigil.
How so?

Have you ever heard the legends? Legends of great men bestowed with great gifts? Gifts of mental fortitude, of unbreakable physical strength? Men and women who became unbreakable walls even in the face of monolithic evil?  All those legends, in spite of their differences, had one thing in common. They had a purpose. Whether they fought and struggled like titans, or whether they committed horrible deeds like a demon, they had a purpose. Something that drove them into doing amazing things, in which the world would never forget.  Yet, here I am. A legend you haven't heard of. I have been gifted insurmountable strength and mental prowess that can challenge even the greatest strategists. I have the power of a God, and I could very well become one.  However, I haven't done a single thing with this grand gift of mine. I want to live a normal life. Struggle like a regular person, love like a regular person and hate like one too. While I am greater than a human my desire is a very primitive one. A human one. And it is to become a part of the crowd and let the peace and quite sooth me.   I‚Äôve heard the legends. I know of the fates they suffered and the deeds they are known for. However, I do not envy them. All I want is a peaceful life and a peaceful end.  That is my wish.

[This guy?](https://i.imgur.com/u6VI3Zt.jpg?2)  For that one I used red and yellow Citadel glazes (though some of the other companies do transparent reds and yellows for brake lights/indicators on model cars) and then dry brushed some white, yellow and orange (in a gradient working up through the yellow to the red) to bring out the ridges, then did the very edge of the sword in the brightest yellow I had (though you might be able to get away with white)  I also touched up the tips of the flames with red, which didn't work as well as the rest of it. If you want it to look like a dirtier flame you can use black on the very tips of the fire ([like this](https://i.imgur.com/0rLxTZf.jpg?1)) but for magical flames I sort of think it looks cleaner if it's not producing smoke/soot

One thing that I think would be great might be a rule history or ability to "snapshot" the current rule/routing set.  There's a "prevent ALB from deletion" parameter but nothing about "prevent rule from deletion" -- It's way too easy to mess up or delete a set of routing rules, and having some sort of easily accessible audit log would be really helpful, even if it's short lived.  &amp;#x200B;  I also think a "blackhole" route target being available by default would be useful. I create this myself now by making a target group with nothing in it, and making that the default.  I always felt that I didn't want shodan or whoever is scanning the internet being able to determine one or more of the websites behind an ALB simply by doing an IP based connection.  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for requesting feedback on the UI, this is really neat.

My god Dutch is one ass. So many times you just gotta roll your eyes at him. I am beyond glad Arthur laughs at him for it at some parts.
You may not realize how massively they fucked up. Hogan making a statement really shows how big this fuck up is, because *he appointed most of them.* 13 of the 17 regents were appointed my Hogan during his last four years, and James Brady, chairman of the board of regents, the giant, braindead mastermind behind this entire decision making process, was the chairman of Hogan‚Äôs first campaign for Governor. By disagreeing with the regents, Hogan is not only opening himself up to criticism, but in a way is directly implicating himself in the process *because he put them in fucking charge.*  Oh, and let me remind you there‚Äôs an election in five days and Larry Hogan is a red governor in a deep, deep blue state.  And yet, their decision was so deluded, so oblivious, and so entrenched in pure, concentrated incompetence, that Hogan still felt the need to directly condemn it.  That‚Äôs how badly we fucked this up.
&gt;but I can‚Äôt even read them as an adult because of the writing.  If Harry Potter series is too difficult, I'd suggest perhaps moving back to the book I'm currently reading: Frog and Toad are Friends. It is a good series overall, and isn't *too* difficult even for the most novice of readers.  I can make that comparison too, comparing Tolkien to Dante is like comparing The Hungry Caterpillar to Harry Potter. Does that make Tolkien any less notable? No, he is still the greatest literary genius of his time. This is some weird strawman I do not understand!  There is nothing wrong with retconning, people just get defensive over their favorite things they grew up with being "ruined " because it is different. It's the same as old people thinking technology is bad, that facebook and texting will spell doomsday for all. People are just oddly predisposed to hating Rowlings, I don't know why! She is quite brilliant even without rose-tinted glasses.
I wonder how people will react when they realize having the server locked to vanilla will get boring fast. As someone who played Old School Runescape and saw how things went down I see something similar happening most likely. The game will have its nostalgic old school fun but the difference is this time everybody knows the meta to the entire game whether by experience or the endless guides and tools that lay it all out now. So that early exciting period will last shorter than expected, the raids will be cleared, people will get their PvP titles, mounts, etc, and then what? They are just going to repeat the same content with nothing new forever? There will have to be some sort of progression whether rereleasing the followup expansions over time but keeping the ‚Äúclassic mechanics‚Äù in the game or doing the unlikely and following Jagex in adding completely new stuff into OSRS. I feel like Blizzard understands this and Classic can be some sort of rerun through the various expansions but as a sort of ‚Äúhardcore mode‚Äù with the mechanics we want. Without any sort of additional content Classic will be a fun but short lived game.
No success, so I pulled again. No point stopping with 60k gems unused. 5/11, with three 35s, including two for Terra. So I'm shutting up now. If I can't clear, it's my own fault, and with that luck I've no room to grouse.   Best of luck and super high scores for all.

&gt;since the current administration is enabling and promoting hate so the groups getting the funding aren‚Äôt making things any better.  But, since the Trump Regime *is* enabling and promoting hate, and they control the purse strings, what would lead you to believe that they'd spend any of that money towards "other options of curbing hate and violence"? Why would they spend money to fight something they're encouraging? It's more like the programs have been defunded and the money will go to something completely unrelated because the Trump Regime has no interest in shutting down domestic terrorist group that are aligned with Trump.

This is what I had done. Took .5 mg Ativan an hour before and drove myself there all calm and drove myself back. It was a breeze. I personally had zero side effects, but that can vary.

This.  OP needs to reconsider the strategy.  It appears this type of consequence is not sufficient to solve the problem, therefore leveraging it will only cause hurt and anger since it's such a big thing.

I suppose it depends on what you qualify as toxic.   Supporting stronger borders, wanting to lower taxes, and other conservative ideas  doesn‚Äôt qualify as toxic. Well, not to sane people anyway.  If someone is rallying for genocide or something, sure.  But judging by these comments it looks like ‚Äúthey like Trump!‚Äù is their standard of ‚Äútoxic.‚Äù  It‚Äôs ironic that the people calling other political fanatics are the ones who‚Äôre cutting people out because their family holds different political views.

I guess, but that‚Äôs also a rare criteria to fulfill.  Most coaches are former players, so to find someone who played, and has worked their ranks up is not common.

Edit: I will add 2 more songs, one is fanmade and the other is from the developer music that never made it into undertale  -Friendship (Never made it, search ‚ÄúFriendship Undertale RED‚Äù Undertale RED is fanmade btw)  -Alphys takes action (Best fanmade music, it‚Äôs related to one of the most important characters in Undertale, Alphys)

I agree a lot of intuition is lost in how things are written and that math can be easier to understand than people give it credit for. That said, I disagree that math itself is easy. Things like proofs can require a lot more creativity than the average person expects of math, and the logic can become significantly harder as abstraction increases. A lot of math majors get floored when they hit their upper divisions (abstract algebra, topology, real and complex analysis, first and second order logic). However, at the undergrad level, there is still some planning to help guide students; creativity, while still present, is put in a funnel to common paths. Keep pushing and the challenges will show. This is not bad, of course: they are beautiful. But they are far from easy.

Ohhhhhhh your such a good temptress! My breaks are 11:15am EST and 4:45pm EST. 
Cut your losses man, chances are it's not yours. You have been dating for 3/4 Months, her sister 6 so they have 2 months of time before you joined, but for him to be hitting on your girlfriend, taking pictures like she is his girlfriend, grinding your girlfriend, sending her DM's asking if they want to fuck. And she is behaving like this while expecting a baby and putting her SO at discomfort defending someone else.  The DM was his, no doubt. You will not be finding any other messages to and from each other like that on socials trust me, better of checking call histories since no more messages will be send directly. Try seeing if she sets up 2nd accounts on socials or starts using snapchat more frequently.  Either way, if you have been in a relationship for 3/4 months with someone, they show this kind of behavior, and she is pregnant for 6 weeks. It's time to get out or talk about everything. And I legit mean everything. Get a counsellor if need be, and you want to give it a last chance. She needs to realize her behavior is putting you to discomfort. Explain everything, not your opinion of them or their actions. Clear communication "this situation made me feel like... Because... happened, what do you think of ... And how can we ... Change it" never use personal attacks like "I think you did... And ... Is bad"  I know it is an "unpopular" thing but if things end taking a wrong turn abortion has to be going at least considered. You are both young, together for less then a year, and having a baby. The situation currently is already not healthy. Do not negate toxic and bad situation because of it. A unhealthy relationship between parents will reflect badly on the kid.  Her being pregnant means that you need counseling or at least a lot of proper communication (the one where you don't blame each other but the one that helps each other figure out there point of views and how to compromise) imo being in a relationship means that you can openly share your opinion so they are known to the other so both of you can consider it before handling on situations. It seems like you are getting disregarded and have to deal with that alone.  Also her leaving the hospital could just be that the parents had seen her, summarized what happened and that she would be released soon. And them figuring out that they could continue on with their day. It was a respiratory problem? So no surgeries etc, probably a prescription, doc's report and release probably. But because procedure would take another couple of hours she left in advance knowing she would see her soon enough. Her boyfriend not staying at the hospital is what is actually troubling me more.  He should live with her so for him it should be more important to be with her when she gets released especially since he later went to get a ride for her parents?(or I am remembering it wrong?) Not for his girlfriend? Also why spent the time with someone else instead of waiting for her to be released. And then if going home, why not go to their own place to prepare for the return of his SO etc.  Either way she has in the past said he was behaving bad or weird about you behind your back. Shown dissaprovement to you showing your SO affection. Intimatly danced with her. Posed on pictures that looked more intimate then he was with his actuall SO. Texted your SO requesting sex.  Also a thing I saw in a other relationship advise was on a different subject involving 2 people(an oldest of 3 siblings catching the other 2 being lovers and not sure how to react to it and if she should notify her mother and how), it will require help from someone you trust completely. Single them out when you catch them on a glimp of something. As in request help from a friend to ask your GF her side of the story. While you get the BF of her sister and do the same thing. This makes them unable to communicate about what they are going to say and you will find inconsistency in their stories. Do this on something new and when it is still recently fresh since they will not have had the time to prediscuss or set up a main story. But this is only ofcourse if you seriously suspect them of cheating.

The mana bases in my decks aren't pretty, depending on what power level I'm going for, so be warned lol  [https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1438050#paper](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1438050#paper)  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: I did quickly look at your list after and forgot to mention I did cut all of my taplands for Smoldering Marsh, XLN/DOM Duals, Luxury Suite, Exotic Orchard (new-ish favorite land in EDH) and painlands. So it is a little better than I remember, oops. Also, Shinka's a pretty gross land. No one wants to deal with First Strike and Deathtouch. I am, however, in the process of switching this over from Queen Marchesa to \[\[Mathas, Fiend Seeker\]\], so we'll see what happens there. The core of the deck is WB so I'll probably just switch it over to my \[\[Daxos, the Returned\]\] deck I'm building.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT 2: Also, forgot I jammed Xantcha, Sleeper Agent in there as well. Don't remember what I cut.

Genre: Mellow Rock I guess, Improvisation.  [https://soundcloud.com/uneditedimprov/the-cozy-place](https://soundcloud.com/uneditedimprov/the-cozy-place)  Im looking for critique of my first proper step toward making music. My guitar skills are sadly poor and lyrics are nonsensical as it's improv. Would love some feedback on how the vocals can be made more interesting though!
Do you have a graphics card? There's literally no ground texture, ground detail, or ground decoration in this screenshot.
Absolutely suck at math ? Don't sweat it. Never sweat anything you're not immediately good at. Certainly don't keep trying to get better at it, learning isn't a skill you will ever need to practice.  Spend your time learning a language that won't be used by the time you get your degree. Don't bother building a portfolio either, the only thing you'll need to get a great job is your diploma.

It was only available for a limited time and you can't even use the app anymore if you have it installed unfortunately.   There's no alternative for it as of now afaik, but I've seen a dev talk about the development of a new app here before. 
And agree with south Stafford scum
Arin is that you?
