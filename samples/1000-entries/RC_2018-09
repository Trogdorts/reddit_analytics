Doubt it. Dude is a backup tackle, not the sexiest position in the world.  But hey he might feature on next week's episode for a few minutes just because he is the subject of a trade.
I got a lot of free wins from people doing this and messing up and backing out. I’m kinda worried they’ll punish people who got free wins. I got like 7 in a row one day. I played every single game I was matched though. Should I be worried???
Everyone drop it?
Interesting, but "re-legalised" is the wrong term to use  I had a google about this and this link seems a lot more informative than what you posted https://qz.com/1351197/asbestos-is-not-banned-in-the-us-trump-may-help-it-come-back/
Defense won't win you championships anymore. It's all about putting up points. Also they already (over) paid Carr, so they're not going to give Mack Donald money.

I knew he's moved around a lot but seeing it in list form is... really something else.  Only 27, going on his 6th year in the NFL, he's been on the Eagles, Cardinals, Bears, 49ers, Cardinals a second time, and now Bengal.
Soft lenses do not meaningfully correct HoA's, while RGPs or Sclerals, through a combination of mechanical plastic deformation and the presence of a tear film, are able to significantly alter the corneal optics in such a way as to smooth the cornea and somewhat correct HoA's. post-LASIK dry eye might be an impediment to contact lens tolerance however.  So a 'nightmare' scenario could very well be contact lens intolerance and HoA symptoms.  Therapeutic transPRK, sometimes combined with corneal cross-linking, is often an option to fix LASIK that has problems of those nature.  But it can be difficult to undergo another surgery after a failed primary surgery.  And therapeutic re-treatments from the relatively few practicioners worldwide who can do them properly can be hard to access.  Not many surgeons are really experienced or properly equipped to treat aberated corneas.
Loooove that frame!
Thx for subbing :)
You must have X-ray vision to be able to see through your own player's body lol 
You act like the jury is ever logical. BB19 is not the only instance of this. Jury pacts are a real thing. Tyler not telling Haleigh/Scottie he's putting them on the block is a small part of a larger problem. A person is naturally inclined to want to reward someone they feel has respected them. Do you really think that Baleigh, RS and Fessy aren't going to vote emotionally? Do you think JC won't be bitter if he's not managed correctly? I actually think Haleigh is one of the votes Tyler could get with less jury management because she seems able to see the game but as of right now she's said she'd vote for JC, Brett and KC before Tyler.

I came here to say this! Regardless of opinion, the fact is that the cyclist broke the law. The cyclist went straight on a right turn only lane. Was the car a dick? Yes. Should the vehicle operator be punished? Fuck yea! But you can't sit there and tell me the cyclist followed the rules of the road. How is that so hard to understand?

Poor Socrates, always having crap attributed to him he didn't say. Too bad people can't stick to what his students definitely reported 100% accurately from his teachings. /s  Seriously though, that is a problem. Given that people think he's the pinnacle of wisdom, they ought to be more careful about tracking down sources. There are even a couple books I've read that are attributed to Plato (in class) that are very obviously pseudographical (or just plain forged).
Didn't you learn from your parents mistake? "Quit cramping my style!" we used to say.
Machine learning is just the natural progression of automation from manual labor to thought labor.  These grand unified AI projects like Watson capture the imaginations of the starry-eyed public but their goals are unrealistic at this time.  If you can identify an area of thought labor that is sufficiently rote, then machine learning may be a solution.
Overseer mask but no corvo?
Tempting... but not the same. 
Effective teaching is reaching all students with informational instruction. It shouldn’t be an ego trip, it’s not a one size fits all gig. I hope that one day if I am lucky enough to become a professor, I’ll be one of those that made a difference - that students speak highly of and assisted in helping them attain their goals. 
As someone who grew up with a stepfather who clearly only wanted to be with my mom; if you’re going to be thinking of them as “someone else’s children” instead of taking them on as your own, do them a favour and don’t bother. You may like her and even grow to love her, but you’re not wrong in saying that you’ll never be her #1 priority. It’s either you accept that, or you ask her to pick between you and her children. 
Awesome ! I'll look into them.
assuming the dps is ccing properly... like it used to be. How can vanilla healers keep their ppl up, yet still die to a dps? Oh yea they have a mana pool, and they need to be peeled for if they are to heal. 
I main attack type and went for a sort of “juggernaut” build. My weapons are chakra blades and my jutsu are; almighty push and lariat. Almighty push is good against multiple people and could be a combo starter or ender. It also breaks guards which is always good against people who sit back and parry all game. It can also disperse those annoying sand shields.  Lariat has become my favorite move in the game so far. Though it has a long windup time, the invulnerability makes up for it. I can’t tell you how much times I’ve bypassed everyone’s jutsu/ninja tools just to clothes line them for the kill. The tracking of this ability is great as well! I’m able to charge a lariat and completely turn a corner to hit someone unsuspected. For my ult I use Lee’s 8 gates. The main purpose is just to give me full hp Incase my healer can’t heal me and I’m about to die. The damage and speed is almost non existent since the buff leaves quickly. And lastly I have Kunai. I use these to extend combos and chase retreating enemies.
Bad refs.
Not 100% what you're looking for, but the closest is from http://www.retrogamecave.com/  I have the NES/SNES supply and I'm happy with it so far. They also offer combined supplies for Genesis, Sega CD, and 32X. Hope this helps!

&gt; you can't stink in a vacuum  Well, astronauts have said that vacuum has a smell to it, so who knows.  But I assume some small part of that jizz would end up in your nostrils.  And if you keep jerking it more would.  &gt; would the jizz actually harden in space  I thought about that after I hit submit.  In a normal atmosphere the liquid would evaporate.  In a vacuum it would sublimate, but being that your mass is the only mass in the universe the vapor would just freeze and come back to you.  Although really, now that I think about it, the universe would be so cold that you would freeze completely. You wouldn't be able to jerk off at all.  Just lay there, locked in a frozen body.
Sweet deck, I have been trying to build one of these decks for a while now and haven't found the right shell, this seems like a very good shell with a toolbox esc aspect, I personally like [[Ruined Halo]] it is probably better than [[rule of law]] as it hoses storm, but it also hoses boggles, and is essentially a removal spell in most matchups whilst being a silver bullet in others, I would probable go two mainboard. Other than that sweet deck!

"The Time Travelers" from *How I Met Your Mother*. Especially in hindsight, this episode is simply gut-wrenching. The scene near the end where Future-Ted talks about what he *would* have done and what he would have said to The Mother, combined with the song "You're All Alone" by John Swihart is just... heartbreaking.

Random pugs can be like that. As can redditors apparently....  I also suggest finding a guild. It is easier to stay in dungeons to learn with a guild run. But, there will always be those kinds of people in lfd/lfr. I played more or less solo for years due to life issues. Now I'm in a guild. And even if I'm sucking at mechanics as I learn them, my guildies help me. This has renewed my interest in the game I've played since 2008. Researching fights is useful, but experience is always the best teacher. 
You haven't answered my question. Doesn't matter, I can see you have no real argument beyond "go away".  Classic. :D
Absolutely brutal episode I followed the show with my roommates  We all watched it recorded but the day it came out, and had about 6 people together. All deep fans, all super excited at new episodes, and very stoned.   Everyone was thrilled we were seeing the future and maybe were about to get a hint at the mother... we were making guessing and voicing theories..   And then the truth hit. Camera pans back it's just lonely beautiful winterscape. The park as empty as her future, everyone was dead silent and awkstruck, hanging on every word she said to herself. Afterwards it was super awkward. Everyone left they felt so shitty
Right? I was comparing gamerscores this month when I noticed D2 got new achievements with the patch. saw this anomaly and couldn't make sense of it 
He would be a starter on any team if Reinhardt becomes a must pick... Easily top 3 Rein in OWL 
I'm glad Furudate did have something in store for Inuoka. I'd never considered him as a potential WS, as he should be a shoo-in for the spot  Kuroo will open when he graduates. But he could certainly be a terror as a WS... It's great that he's worked a lot on his receives (dogs can receive too!) and is being spurred by Hinata's growth.  That said, flashbacks are all fine and dandy but sparing a couple of pages for Inuoka at some moment of the Summer Camp would have made his character arc more organic. He fell out of (the narrative's) grace way too abruptly.  It's also a good omen (for the possibility of Year 2) that Furudate is adding depth to Nekoma's roster with Teshiro. I wonder how will they take advantage of the 'Calculated One-Point Two-Setter' (lol). Considering Kenma's reaction, maybe he's a decent server?  I also wonder if we'll ever meet #8 and #10. If we go by the team's vacancies, both should be WS and, considering the numbering, 1st years. It bothers me that Nekoma has so few third and second years but I'm not going to be too picky about this.
From my point of view, this is better than a meme !

Sounds like my husband, but at least she shuts up while sleeping. My husband not only talks, squawks, sighs, hums, grunts and groans in between all the hair curling yelps as if he is in danger/pain/shocked that occur 60x a day, but he talks and sings in his sleep too. Nightly, without fail. 14 years together and I think he's only slept silently when he had the flu. Jokes on him - he has been injured repeatedly and I've failed to come rescue him every time. Broken bone or just needs attention, how can I tell anymore? It all sounds the same.   Don't marry in a hurry kids, or accept the rude surprises that happen after the wedding. Your choice.   &amp;#x200B;

I have been waiting for the Gunfighter since the first announcement. Like almost 3 years ago, I'm in Europe too. Yet I didn't went Virpil, as I value the additional functionality of the VKB stuff. I had an extended Warthog for over 6years, the Virpil T50 would clearly be an upgrade on the Gimbal side. As we can't really sell the Warthog Gimbal alone, I sold my full stick, and I find the T50 grip to be a downgrade to the Warthog, so.. Going extended Warthog to T50 base and Grip wouldn't have been a so huge update. While going GF I win MiniStick, brake lever, dry clutch. No loss at all, only win. T50 grip don't have CMS.. Huge no go for me. Also the software is far from Target and the VKB configurator. The larger throw of the GF and curved extension also interest me a lot. Again, going Warthog 15° to Virpil \~12 to 15, apparently it's not symmetrical on the pitch axis, would have been a loss. While I win 5° on each side with the GF. If I had went Virpil, I would have wanted their next Grip for the Ministick, I also would like twist, so.. Again another Grip? Or an adapter? While going VKB I go GF MCG pro and I don't see what they could do more to upgrade their grip really. Force sensitive ministick, but that's really expensive, I would also have preferred only one ministick, and a 4 or 5 way hat for trim.

Coffee should be black to be coffee. Anything else does change the flavour. Side rant: I like a little bit of milk in mine; why is it that every time I visit the States, the standard is cream? Restaurants have to take 20 mintues to look for milk. Even the airplanes don't have milk! Mcdonalds had to give me a separate kids milk jug becuase they don't have milk available for coffee? It's absurd.

If something less than a few solar masses became a black hole, it could not possibly stay a black hole  You realize that we've never actually witnessed a black hole or its behavior, right?

Hive can still be useful against bosses that you can get close (schineider for example) but yeah, i agree with you.   They should tag some missions and FORCE some players (maybe high levels) to pick some style of characters, or just make every boss to have a aleph induced starge where you can ditch some heavy damage while close
People just didn’t have the access to information we do now. Still, the politics and diplomacy game are the same, people just realize a lot of it is based on bs now. I think the biggest concern with Trump is his ability to utilize all of the broken parts of a system that is over due for an overhaul. Dudes not even pretending to put up a front. Barring an actual catastrophe, I hope his presidency is a net gain based solely on how it illuminates inefficiencies in out political structure.

Were you waiting on the waiting room for twenty minutes? Or did the MA weigh you, room you, get your vitals, do a med reconciliation, get your history and then go back to check your records for any routine screenings you might be due for before finally briefing the doctor on everything she found? An inexperienced MA can take 20 minutes to get all that done.

Apples and oranges. Three years ago I was in a railroad in the heart of Williamsburg paying 2400. Laundry in unit, dishwasher, great light, awesome spot. 1200 between me and a roommate. An apartment like OP would only be 1200 in place like st marks where shitty apartments are tolerable for art students who need to live in a shit hole like at marks. Even in Williamsburg this apartment wouldn't be acceptable so it'd either be cheaper than you think or, more likely, just not exist at all.  The price of shit in new york varies widely and shitty apartments like this one tend to not be as expensive as people think. Overpriced, yeah, but not 1200. 
But instead just using it people will complain about their privacy

Irony that this is comment that was shame deleted.
I honestly feel like people who buy purebreds are less likely to mistreat a dog or just drop it off at a shelter if they are sir of it because A) they spent a lot of money for that animal, it’s cemented in your brain as very valuable and B) that person probably put a lot of thought into getting that dog before doing so. They thought about what types of personalities, energy level, shedding level, etc. fits best with themselves and then pursued the breed that best fit that. Instead of “I have the feels for this animal in this cage.” but then the reality of that pup sets in and they weren’t prepared for what they were getting into because there was no way to prepare for that particular dog. As long as it’s a responsible breeder(not puppy mill or bad breeding practices) I have no problem with people shopping instead of adopting. Stop being ashamed of buying breed specific. Adoption is wonderful but shopping isn’t bad.

Pretty neat feeling to suddenly know something you didn’t know a moment before. I think it’s a result of being receptive. Like how a circuit can’t transmit electricity if it’s dirty. Your mind is your antenna and it picked up the distress call.   I had a moment recently where I was looking at a small hand-painted box I got at a garage sale many years ago. It has “Fattu in Corsica” written on the bottom and it shows little lady in front of a window with water and a tower in the background. On this particular day my brain said “That’s in Catalonia” - just as a statement, no particular emotion. I stopped what I was doing and had an argument with myself about how can I just make shit up? Well I looked it up and it is a painting of Vila Vella in Tossa Del Mar. I have never been there.   It’s sad that this woman died in your community. I think it would be nice if you had a little remembrance ceremony for yourself just to honor her. A similar thing happened in my community and in the same way the victim resembled me too. I didn’t know her personally but it still really hurt to see my people in pain. I am not religious but I lit a candle and wished her peace in my own way. I’ve made steps since then to be more engaged with my neighbors so that if anything happens to any of us we have a network.   Maybe see if there’s some some community initiative to make that area more safe or start one. Or find out what she was passionate about and volunteer in her memory. Never let firm taps on the shoulder like this go unrecognized.   Hugs, cozy blankets, hot tea and fluffy socks to you! 
Hey thanks for the correction! Appreciate it, I also love the movie

Flaws I know of are huge pull tabs (slightly noticeable) and primeknit is shifted/exposed by a tiny bit - black zebra pattern at the back should be concealed a little bit more by the midsole. (Won't be noticeable on foot imo)
Makes sense
I would seriously consider more than a 2200g if the goal is to get a high end GPU to pair with later on. 4 physical cores are just not as good as 6 physical cores, not to mention the 2200g being lower clocked.   Case in point, compare the i7-7700k vs i5-8400. The 8400 has 6c/6t at 4GHz max, while 7700k "the old gaming king" had 4c/8t at 4.7GHz OC or so. Well guess what, the 8400 basically matches the 7700K in gaming benchmarks. Physical cores matter a lot and will only become even more important as time goes on. 
Oh fuck these were so dumb.
I'm so dumb, I read the titled and my brain thought Asuka. I was waiting for Asuka to show up and then was like is she recording.  Reread the title to complete the embarrassment.

Pax Romana still meant bloody terrible wars with the Persians, Germans, and Celts, they were pretty good considering it was BC, but Pax Romana didn’t bring peace to Asia or most of the near east.  Pax Mongolus was enforced by raping, murdering, and enslaving entire cities, kinda of a shitty world peace imo   Well we have, some how some way the top fifty biggest economies haven’t fought  each other since WWII. The USSR never had the international force projection of the US, they couldn’t really change governments and control people outside of the the Eurasian continent, America was however able to exert dominance much farther away, I think it was more America keeping the soviets in line then the other way around.

No, it's that vegetarians and vegans are an incredibly small minority, and the rest of us just don't really care. Plus, it's pretty entertaining when someone who slightly inconveniences you with their food restrictions semi-regularly gets irritated about you not being more interested in their inconvenient food choices.   Why is it that so many people belonging to relatively small groups suddenly expect everyone to give a shit about what they do? Guaranteed, those very same people aren't interested in my meat preferences.

did you mention that you had both cards and received the bonus on the CSR already? or did they just come out and tell you that was the reason?
A lot of modern decks are built to be concistent, aggro decks are tuned to put pressure on early, control decks are tuned to have answers, and mid range decks and tuned to answer threats, and play their own. Even though affinity has a lot of duds, as well as elves, but they have a suprising  amount of wincons. Ravager, plating, overseer, etched champion are all deadly cards.  There is a category normally referred to as glass cannon, such as grishoalbrand. That deck can win on turn 1, but it is an all in combo. And without the right pieces it let's other decks win easily.  Some aggro decks have less reach, or have trouble beating certain strategies/cards. Even in that case they tend to be pretty well tunes, Bridgevine and hollow one are more variance then any other aggro deck, even so they still perform very often.  Most combo decks are designed to consistently win with a regular hand. Storm players can goldfish turn 4 very reliably. What makes a combo deck consistent is 7 or 8 copies of a card that can win for you after setup. Storm has 4 gifts ungivdn and 4 past in flames, paired with lots of can trips seeing 1-2 of these cards is highly likely. Scape shift can win with scape shift or prime time. Ad nauseum  needs silence/unlife and spoils/ad naus. Living end play 7 cascade spells. See the trend?

There's no one-size-fits-all answer for this. Many of the down payment assistance programs are state bond programs, and many states have several that cover varying amounts of money. For example, in NC, you can get a 3% or 5% down payment assistance program, or there's a program that offers $8,000 flat. In GA, there's a program that covers $15,000 in certain counties, but in other areas there's just a $5,000 grant (unless you work in certain fields, and then it's $7,500). Some involve a second lien that is repayable after 30 years or when the home is sold, and some have a second lien that is 100% forgivable after a certain period of time, and some are just a grant. Certain cities or counties have their own programs, too. Some mortgage companies offer their own down payment assistance grants, too.   What state are you in? That's a good place to start.

This is like the other football. That soccer one where the refs have too much impact.
No. Absolutely not. Their steel was not high quality even after processing just acceptable. In addition the one blade of a katana is a massive disadvantage as if your "one hit" misses or does not inflict enough damage, you can't come swinging back upwards. Using a katana is much more difficult and come down more to footwork  than sword handling. Honestly a German knight or even just a fairly trained HEMA person wouldn't give them a chance to attack. Samurai turned their disadvantage into an art form which is quite cool, but I think in a match up the katana can't hold a candle to a knight. I'm untrained and given the choice between a katana or a longsword obviously the longsword is better for me.
Inside knowledge? It was evident from watching this team. Chriss comes to summer league out of shape, he doesn’t have the stats, and he was constantly showing bad body language and getting called for technicals.

she can sign up for Medicaid .. depending on the state most will help you get her sorted out and into care .. assisted living is likely a good place to start .. if she cant work the state will help.. and go appky for ssi  ( get the social worker to help you get thru the paperwork) know that while she is waiting for that, every state gives a small amount for money  its called  General Assistance  and that gives her medical and foodstamps .. look up your state services for seniors .. you can get help

Do you know the difference between a federal designation and a state law?   In regards to the telecom designation, congress had simply never done their job and given the FCC the right to regulate broadband. Therefor net neutrality could not be implemented at the federal level. To get around that the FCC listed broadband as falling under telecommunication designation, which they did have the right to regulate. That gave the FCC the right to regulate, but also added a bunch of arcane and restrictive telecommunication rules that fell under the law. It had nothing whatsoever to do with restricting freedom of speech. When Ajit Pai ruled to change broadband designation back from telecommunication, he effectively blocked the FCC from regulating the internet and ended net neutrality. All that needs to happen to restore net neutrality on the federal level is for congress to pass a law granting the FCC the right to implement net neutrality over broadband. Then we get net neutrality back and no asinine telecomunication rules to go along with it.  Cal. Penal Code § 653m(b) on the other hand is a state law. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the federal net neutrality, telecom designation by the FCC, or even the state net neutrality (unless that particular code was revised by the net neutrality law). That state law existed separate of the FCC net neutrality and seperate of the state net neutrality. It exists whether either of those net neutrality laws exist. And as such, using it as an argument against net neutrality is disingenuous at best, especially since net neutrality is about regulating ISPs and not user content.  You're basically conflating a bunch of separate stories to create a narrative.

Relax. You don't really need to tell them anything just now. Explore and find out for yourself, try, experiment and see what you like and what feels good to you. Just live your life, and when and if it comes to you having serious relationship with someone of your sex, you will cross that bridge.  But there is nothing to be scared of.

Correlation is not causation. How can you test causality? With controlled, randomized trials.  Clinical trials have disproved the hypothesis that PrEP decreases condom usage. You’re worrying about an effect that’s been shown not to exist.  Are STI rates increasing in heterosexuals too? If the answer is yes, that should also disprove your assertion.  STI rates are higher in people on PrEP. This is because those people aren’t using condoms *already.* HIV rates are, of course, much lower; this is the rational result of a set of priorities where people care about HIV but not other STIs.

You’ve only been together a year and already the sex is dead? That’s not a good sign. You guys need to talk about this and decide what you want to do going forward. Maybe all you need is to jump-start your sex life (for example, set up rules like you have to have sex at least twice a week and it can’t be any place you’ve ever had sex before, and you’ll each take turns planning it). Or maybe you’re just not sexually compatible and you need to re-evaluate what this relationship is going to be going forward and if it should go forward.

In no situation should a player be forced to swap teams. It always swap players when one team is steamrolling the other. And usually a team is losing badly because they're all hill humping recons. Very rarely is it because high rankung players are on one team while the other is new or low ranked players.  Edit: if you find yourself losing badly no matter how hard you try then stop and observe how many hill humpers or obnoxious tank drivers you have. Most likely you're one of a handful that's PTFO and it'll be difficult to win against a 12-32 player team.

I am, by no means, "sensative". I work in an industry that requires a good sense of humor and I make very off colored and racist jokes all the time. I'm never serious about it and don't consider myself racist, I hate everyone equally. However, if someone were to use this as their opening remark to "break the ice", I would immediately assume this person is an idiot and will not contribute anything positive in chat from this point on. I would mute this person and report them before the match even starts. I would be offended not because of the hurtful nature of the word, but because it's just so stupid.  Edit: words.

you can try adept style. it's all about taking advantage of dodging. A successful adept dodge will give you access to very powerful moves. GS for example becomes a very mobile weapon in adept style.

A start should be dramatic and set the tone, so as to draw in the reader. But it can be subverted to match the book's genre : eg Pratchett's Wyrd Sisters. It was a dark and stormy night and 3 witches gathered, then they started a fairly normal if humour conservation quickly establishing their personalities and the break from expectations.

It is certainly not equivalent to low settings on a PC. You’re delusional. 
There are some moments when your existence seems to be an offense to the universe.  Like the time when I moved to the Denver metro, and was taking a bus to my temp job at a company that was on it's way out of business, so going there was depressing as fuck.  I got off the bus and started the mile walk up uphill at Interlocken which is a sprawling corporate office park.  The building was up near the crest of the hill next to Rocky Mountain Metro Airport.  The kicker was that it was during a blinding spring snow storm.  On the way up I slammed my big toe into a sidewalk slab that was sticking up a couple inches but covered in snow. The pain was excruciating because I have arthritis of the big toe. (hallux rigidus) So I'm walking uphill in a fucking snowstorm to a job that I had to take and stub my arthritic toe on a slab of cement.   7 years later that memory is etched in my mind as a low point where the universe was trying to tell me something.
That's about the only way something like this could happen.  With normal voltages to the lines it never could happen like this.  Even with dirty insulators. The question is how they'd screw it up that badly.

Left em alone today actually, and came home to them snuggled up grooming each other, and purring with little sleepy eyes. My cat is a very social cat, and I am not a first time cat owner. After leaving them home, with mad anxiety for the couple hours I was gone, my slightly older cat has learned to be MUCH gentler. I deliberated over the decision to bring home #2 for months and was entirely prepared to rehome if it didn't work. But, considering my cat has befriended to the point of snuggling through our kitchen window with strays, and has walked up to german shepherds and other large dogs at our vets office only to purr on their legs and desperately want more companionship, it was the right decision. This damn cat has never met a stranger, animal or human, he didn't want to love on. It was hard on him for the first couple days, but today..  my cat is not anxiously overgrooming, my cat is not meowing incessantly into corners, and my cat is much happier than he was a week ago.

All this wishy washy stuff you're saying has only been in mainstream feminism for a handful of years. We are not a mainstream feminism kind of sub.  Here we reject post modernism and queer theory. Words have meaning. We use gender the way feminists used it from the beginning, to talk about sex status, sex roles, and sex stereotypes. It's entirely cultural, by definition. Anything innate is biological, by definition. That's sex. They are different things.  Biological sex is binary, ova producers on one hand and spermatozoa producers on the other. That's how reproduction works in our species and every other sexually reproducing species on the planet. Exceptions of infertility and disorders of sexual development don't break the rule. If you wanted to start an egg farm you wouldn't get a mix of roosters and chickens and hope they all laid eggs, now would you? Stop pretending you don't know how reproduction works.   Read the resources in the sidebar and don't post again unless you can keep up with the discussions here. If you can't handle that words have meanings we don't want to talk to you.

I think given the fact that investors / holders are the most numerous group they will tend to have the loudest voice, so I agree we need to be careful to temper those demands.

Transaction fees should eventually cover the bill of security but we are not there yet.  I'm definately for ProgPow but will defer to the core devs on its security and effectiveness.

(your imgur link is broken, btw)   I've always wondered why antennaweb shows practically no channels for my address, but dozens six houses down the street. Does it know that much about the geography and other obstacles between my house and the antenna farm?  Also, with my old flat-wave whatever, on an outside wall of my master closet 20 feet on from TV, on it's included amp, with a baking sheet behind it (believe it or not), I used to get all the major channels except KTBC down in the low VHF frequencies.   That's until recently, when I, too, began having spotty performance with KXAN and KLRU. In fact, at that time I even picked up a larger (better?) antenna for the attic, but haven't found the sweet spot for it (difficult to do by myself). I also need to try it in my master closet since that's where the flat one worked best (I have tech shield on the roof decking). It amazed me it worked better on the wall, with trees, brick, and all the homes between here and there, but that was the best spot I found in the house.   Oh, one time, a directional antenna handed down to me performed best pointed at the FLOOR in the same closet than it did pointed at the towers.   Truth be told, I don't watch a lot of TV, so fixing it hasn't been a priority; just like to always get it working before guests expect to see games on the TV during the holidays. 
Donovan just won’t play him, I’ve only seen Johnson on the court a handful of times. Donovan prefers undersized agile 5’s (Grant, Taj, even Robes a few times) to the traditional, slower, 7 ft + tall center. Dakari may have a spot in the NBA, but it’s not going to be under Donovan.

I think I'm going to have to.  My mom tells this story of how they got together. Basically, she really fancied my dad back in high school, but he never talked to her. He's two years older, so he would have been two grades higher. When he graduated, she figured she'd never see him again.  Except: late that summer, he showed up at her door, at her house, to ask her out. He's never explained why he felt inspired to do that, or why her specifically, or how he knew where she lived, or, well, anything about that, really. All I have to go on is mom's story.  If time travel is real, I may have to go back to that summer and convince my father to ask my mom out. I have no idea how I'm going to do that.

My understanding of the Star comes from the cards that surround it. Before the Star is the Devil and the Tower. Both are intense cards that suggest a shaking of your foundations, but the Star comes in and soothes it. It’s like the calm after the storm.   Also, to me, the pond represents the deepest parts of the self. After the trauma of the Tower, the pond is revealed, and it offers a chance to reconnect with one’s soul. There’s a lot of introspection and self-love in the Star.

Lol yeah, but I think Honda in Indy is run separately from Honda in F1. Obviously the reporting line meets somewhere above in the hierarchy, but they probably run independently of each other. Plus it's already an established name in Indy, other teams are already using it successfully. So Alonso cant just go to Indy and start saying shit about Honda.   Unless someone high up in Honda is holding a grudge for last three years and starts giving him bad engines. JK, Very Unlikely and improbable  My point is he probably did burn a few bridges in F1, but I think that will be contained in F1

Yea, but in your garbage bin there isn't millions of people that are in close enough proximity that it would be very vulnerable. And once it gets collected, it will likely be obliterated and never seen again.   By putting it on the internet, you're basically knocking at the front door of anyone who's looking for the info you've just provided them, and that info will essentially exist as long as the internet exists.

&gt;You do understand that private practices still have to adhere to FDA regulations right?   I was speaking more in terms of things such as products and equipment. A great example would be things like vitamins. Most vitamins aren't approved or screened by the FDA.  &gt;I don't think you understand what "public" means in this context. It has to do with where the funding comes and how the organization is structured and operated.   The issue is that if the public funding has to guarantee any and all potentially necessary treatment, it doesn't matter whether or not you're funnelling the money through a private insurance company, it becomes an easily exploitable thing. Just imagine epipens as an example. They already demonstrated they'd be willing to raise the prices. Do you seriously think the government will have the capacity to just say "no" when Epipen raises to price to something absurd? How well do you think it'll go over when someone has to explain to the public "until we can get epipens for a reasonable amount of money, you're all fucked."

... it would be good PR if they fired him though??? Everyone supported when they removed Sanjuro.  Saying his account was compromised has gotten them worse PR than if they'd just said "we have dealt with him"  Your cynicism is making you ignore rationality

He was shit and has always been shit. He has lower defense than a lot of offensive units and less offensive stats compared to tanks. He has a useless z ability and hybrids are shit - better off running a double colour or double red team with someone else instead.  The only good thing he brings is his cover damage ability, but that’s not enough to make a unit good.
Revel wouldn't be bad for you at all. If you're thinking about the DM1, beware of its sides. They're a little sharper and less safe than the Revel's, with the Revel's sides sort of resembling the left side of your G403 with the curve being a little farther back.

Tommy with a nice ground ball past the Indians.  So 2 on, 1 out.
For some reason, they always find it more important to steal the show.   On my birthday couple weeks ago, which my dad celebrated for the first time in 6 years so that was a pretty big deal for me, my stepsister decided to announce her pregnancy when every family member had arrived and were at my bday for like 30 minutes..  So for the next 5 hours every was focused on her and her boyfriend and I got ignored. So I just grabbed 2 bottles of wine and went to sit in the garden. Im rather drunk and listing to music on my bday than having to listen to that woman talk about her fetus. 
I won't allow anyone to bitch when I put Ace of Bass on. The station is so goofy I love it. 
First infertility appointment coming up on Thursday. We've only been trying for a few months, but I was diagnosed with PCOS a few weeks ago and then just had my 33rd birthday. We're going to be paying out-of-pocket to go to this clinic, but neither my husband or I want to wait for a year for insurance benefits to kick in. I'm nervous for the whole process, but grateful that at least we have the privilege of being able to see a specialist at this point in time.
It's a freedom of expression issue.
2008 thanks man I appreciate it
I never found it funny either
I was diagnosed with EDS, and scored 5 on the Beighton. My geneticist said my current joint flexibility would not be enough for her to give me a diagnosis of hEDS, even with that score. She thought I was just naturally flexible.  So instead, she looked at my medical history (I dislocate/subluxate almost daily), and did a full physical exam. She found a few physical indicators of vascular type, but I didn't have enough major symptoms to be diagnosed vEDS. Then, during the physical, she found [piezogenic papules](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0601/p2327.html) on my heels. These are usually associated with EDS, but not with Marfans. She called it immediately at that point.   The Beighton score is important, but connective tissue is everywhere, and so there are n number of specific presentations. I hope you find the best way to treat your symptoms soon ☺
Can't hate on the man for the path he took since sober, but damn I loved old shady.

True. I think this new shit was pretty bad tbh. Dude needs to hang it up.

Just think of how long it took him both to decide to do this and to master this.
so...
Thank you so much! It took a while to get the pattern back but I’m happy :-)

As I Lay Dying was apparently a Christian metal band.   Then their singer went to jail for trying to hire a Hitman to murder his wife.   And that's pretty fuckin metal. 
&gt; I did not say “I think I might have ADD/anxiety/etc.” Instead, I went down the list of symptoms that I or someone close to me had noticed (documented beforehand).  How do you subtly bring it up to a doctor? I tried to do that a while ago but I can't tell if I blew it or if my doctor's just an asshole. I don't trust my own perception of things enough to know if something's a problem or not, and I find it hard to bring things up when I have nothing to physically show for it.

i booked one of these deals several months ago and will be flying to Osaka in the first week of October.   going to hike the Kumano Kodo (Kohechi route) trail for several days.   this might possibly be the cheapest private trip to Japan in the history of mankind...  except that i booked the Westin in downtown Osaka for my final night in Japan. since three nights will be under the stars, i figured it was worth a splurge.

&gt; I don’t think anyone actually is gonna quit league because the company has a not amazing workplace environment.  You're probably right, but when managers are farting in each other's faces Terrence and Phillip style, that doesn't exactly scream that Riot is a good environment to work in, and that is going to affect the game eventually.

Everything you claim to want, Trump has literally done the opposite.
I see what you mean. It’s difficult though when hardly anyone in your team attacks and it’s typically a low scoring game. If we had a more even spread and it was a close match I would play differently. Ideally everyone would play this way but I think it only works if you have a whole club doing the same thing. Having said that I’d much rather a war where there was plenty of attacks than a boring one where everyone hides under shields and doesn’t rebuild

Talk to them. Participating in class is a great way to start, because then they can see that you're engaging with them and the material that they teach -- aside from that, yes, going to office hours can help. I'd say to start by participating in class so that the professor can get to recognize who you are, that you're engaged and motivated, etc. and then to start going by their office hours to talk.  If you do choose to go by their office hours, make sure you do your research first -- if you want to speak to them about their own research, look them up online (the school website or elsewhere) to see what kind of work they have done in the past. If you can find any of their publications, read or skim something to see what you can grasp from it. This way, if you don't have any questions or comments about the course material, you can approach the professor to tell them what you find fascinating in their research.  Honestly, my rapport with the professor who created the position *for me* began when I followed her on Twitter. I hadn't even taken her classes yet, but I was registered for three of them and was about to start my first semester of university (as a transfer student) so I figured that I'd follow her and get a feel for who she was so I'd be prepared when I started her class. She followed me back, and by the time the semester began, we already knew enough about each other that we made comments in class to one another regarding our interests.

Gonna be honest, as long as your boss is rude to magic players, people won't show up. If there's other options, all it takes is one or two bad experiences at a store, especially with workers and management, to turn them off from that place forever. I've seen it kill several stores that tried to open up in my hometown.   As far as prize support, players want packs. And entry fee should help with that cost, but if the store isn't providing some incentive of their own (ie, throwing their own money for a few extra prize packs) then people will not play. If your boss is not willing to spend money on magic, magic players will not spend money on him.
I've read that guide. It focuses 100% on solo camps to the detriment of any sort of leveling advice for grouping as a Necro.
Maybe Mathias Berthelot, though I doubt most people here would know what he did.   Much wider known and not really a foreigner Karl I of Romania was born in modern Germany and came to rule the United Romanian Principalities. Greatly respected for puting his people first despite his origins.
If you're offended by that you really need to grow thicker skin lmao

I never ask but I’m also in SCO so whatever change customers leave goes to CMN. The thing I find annoying is all the associate fundraising things management create. Mostly because I’m broke and I feel like a dick because I’m not throwing in on the potluck, baseball team event, or paying a $1 for bottle water when water is free in the break room. Yesterday I was asked for money to make a manager wear pink for a week. Sorry I’m broke and I don’t care if she hates pink.
I mean, the first fifty seconds he says it's not worth a quarter of half of its current price. I feel like that was pretty quick.

Thank you!
Lots of unexpected turns and new characters actually keep it slightly interesting for me compared to the recent season(s) of TWD -- where it's the same exact shit every episode, same people, same faces, same lines.  Yeah, not all of it is logical right now in Fear, and there's some infuriating moments of TWD lunacy creeping in (Gimpleisms), but right now, a weak Fear episode is still better than most of the recent TWD episodes imo
What else can you say about a person who goes to bat for a guy who's literally never demonstrated loyalty to anything except himself and maybe Putin and Russian interests (you saw Helsinki and _nobody_ bought his "n't" defense)?  This is a true statement now matter how you slice it.

Absolutely not. It was a super unrefined product of the times. Very good player though.
That’s weird they said it was a bad cold. My doctor must have been amazing. My bgs were only 30mmol when we fought it. My dad brought me in for looking pale and slim, peeing all the time. Super grumpy. It was actually his appointment but brought me in. I was 11 at the time. He made me pee on a stick and sent me to the children’s diabetes clinic downtown the next day. Took a needle and voila! You’re daughter looks really healthy now and you’re a great mom for following this subreddit!

Watch nerds may sneer, but I've literally never met a watch nerd in the wild. They seem to only exist on the internet. I have many watches that are much much nicer than my cheap Invicta, yet the Invicta always gets the most comments. It's actually somewhat annoying, but it makes it hard not to recommend them to watch novices. After all, that's how I first got into watches.

You are not hideous based on the body pics with black hair. You are (were?) actually decent for an entire 260#. The picture on this post is a solid 3/10 being very generous. But get back to 160# with the fashion and hairstyle taste in the 260ibs body pictures, and we are looking at a low 8, 8.4/10. As it stands though, 3/10 firm.

I concur and can confirm that.
You completely misrepresent what Cap believes, claiming it differs from Peter, when in reality they have essential the same belief system.  You also stated he's pushing an agenda which isn't the case.   Captain America is not making superheroes travel around the world fighting wherever they're needed. He just wants to be able to do that himself, just helping because it's right, and not be hampered by a governmental agencies, that we *know* are prone to infiltration.   My entire first comment is spelling out the places where you're wrong in analysis. 
The American sports system is so much better than Europe's. Soccer needs a salary cap.
Which of them? Didn't see any in your inventory so figured you had them on another account.
Sure, Jan...I mean Ron. The thing is, Ron and Jen thrive on chaos. It's probably all they've ever known. They both like to be the victim, bring others in to their bullshit for validation and attention, and get mad when they are told things that they don't like to hear. Like, "Go to the lawyer, and get your shit together". They also get mad when after they told their friends, family, etc all of these horrible things about their s/o, and when they back peddle (as seen above), they get mad when people call them out on their hypocrisy. "Well, that was before. We're (magically) "changed" now. We're in a "good" place."   I don't think Ron and Jen would even know how to function in a healthy relationship. What pisses me off is, Ron was crying last night. Not just solely for his daughter, but for himself for attention. Jen is a crazy fuck and Ron is a crazy fuck. Another Sid and Nancy. However, unlike Sid and Nancy, there is an innocent baby involved who doesn't deserve ANY of this. I think the next time Ron cries wolf, the roommates should just go about their business and ignore him...but then that might backfire, "My roommates are never there for me! B-O-O H-O-O"

Yes, but the revolution didn't have an impact on Britain. You are learned about in the context of the World Wars, League of Nations, and the American Civil War.

So I've been going to this dentist since the early 2000s. Around 2008 this dentist built a building across town, rented out most of it to other businesses, and he moved his practice to the 2nd floor where it has done quite well. Both the building and the practice were named after him, last name of course. When they opened in the new building they put in the latest computer filing system for dentists, and I think they've switched it since for another newer one. While they kept all the original paper files, they never bothered to enter them in the new system.   A few years back he sold the practice and the new owners changed its name. At least three times I have had to argue with some young dental tech, that yes, I have had this surgery.  $dentist did it 15 years ago, twice,  back in the old office, back when the practice had a different name, different owner,  different filing system, and different location.

My ex's dick tasted just fine. Only dick I've ever sucked so not sure if it comes down to cleanliness or something. There's a way to not really taste the cum when they jizz in your mouth. 
no

hey so you're getting a bit hairy, i'm not sure if you've noticed that, just saying is all...  it's fine, you're cool, i mean, i don't know..  listen, dude, you resemble a fox man, and it's really freaking me out.  it works for you, i get it, it suits you, but you've changed man, you've changed.

&gt; certainly heavier than Stone Age but since when was more depth a bad thing.  The problem is, it's more complex but that complexity comes not with a lot more depth. "Heavy" is the result of width and depth. Complexity is width, strategical options and paths to victory are depth. More rules in general, more finicky rules, more exceptions, that's all more complexity without more depth. The opposite is Go. Just a handful of rules and strategical choices for centuries.  Stone Age is a very good worker placement game for entry level players and is even good for the more veteran players. If you just play with veteran players...play something meatier like Viticulture, Caverna, Tzolkin, Russian Railroads or Anachrony.

Whispers is another dark episode for O’Brien   http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Whispers_(episode)
Because we totally all want an open world Hulk game right? Some heroes powers just translate to video games better. Plus Spiderman has never (to my knowledge) ever had a real chance to shine in video games, and certainly never on the scale of this game.
Watching this game on the Fox Sports app means the same commercials every time. The same 6 commercials. I think I’m going to start memorizing them. 
Indeed I can - they open again at 9am so I shall ring them then :)

YES shows too many replays for the other team. I swear they showed V-Mart's homer more than Stanton's 300. 
Wikia, unfortuantely, doesn't care. They make their money through advertising revenue and we've been putting up with it for a while. It's pretty frustrating for us too as people who maintain it. But, watch this space I guess.

Rembrandt was born in Leiden, so very much Dutch. Though, there was no real difference between being Dutch and Flemish at the time; culturally the same... the only difference was that the Flemish were under Spanish occupation.  As for William of Orange, we've had... kind kind of a lot of them. Eight seperate people in fact.
Oh shit you're right it does

well I have 500 gigs left on the M.2 SSD I am using for edditing. I like to think I have a small map...  It should have less then the length and with of the island.  if I have my math right it is 9th the size of the island.  is that still to big?  I plan on bumping this thing up to 46Gigs of ram soon.  I am just wondering where my problem is.
While that's definitely something people should be doing, in this case its unlikely the owners could pay for the surgery, and I highly doubt the good guy in the video has been able to do that to the animals he's taken in.
It’s what’s called a false dichotomy. “Well they both can’t be racist! The worse one is racist and the other who aren’t so bad are not racist.” Except they can both be racist.
Hi!!  First of all, the loading times are quite cruel. I'm commenting as I play, if it wasn't feedback friday I would just give up.  I have had some issues of buttons appearing on top of texts too.  The system seems complex enough with crystals and wands, which is cool. I can't see every part of the controls because the screen cuts off though. It does seem a bit overwhelming with a lot of stuff.  I like the in gameplay graphics, looks way better than the UI stuff. I think you would better have a tutorial to introduce the controls.. Maybe. Putting X as the button to leave the game is a bit upsetting, maybe use ESC? Easy to press X by accident.  The camera troublesome when you entered closed spaces, not sure how you can fix that though.  Best of luck, here is my game if you have time! https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9bq8m7/feedback_friday_304_fascinating_finds/e56oro7/
Amen. I want home uniforms for both teams always for this game.

LOL I wonder how many times you screamed tryna put out the fire properly on the map 
I can't tell you how sorry I am that you are left with such a bleak outlook. It's totally understandable of course, and I feel that way myself some days, but I hate it when the bad guys win, and the bad guys win when the good guys lose hope.  Totally agree about the right wing propaganda machine though. I know a lot of factors contributed to Trump falling breathless and exhausted on the finish line, but without Rush and Faux News etc. he wouldn't have had a chance.  The First Amendment was supposed to guarantee that voters had access to accurate information, but, as with so many issues regarding the constitution, the founding fathers could not have imagined the technology we've created or how easy it would become to spread lies and bigotry to millions if people instantaneously.  Anyway, please don't give up hope my friend. Sure, your country elected Trump and Dubya, but it also elected FDR and Obama (imagine what he could have accomplished with a cooperative congress) and there will be more presidents with honor and ethics that truly care about the welfare of the American people. Keep fighting the good fight!
Yeah sure, wait till you're affected yourself :)
Yeah for sure. Hindsight is awesome. I should never have risked my life over a fucking lane lol. Kinda amazing how if the right events line up we do stupid things we'd never do otherwise.

Hi!
True, last year there was a fellow freshman who was at least 6'2 and gigamogged everybody.  I switched to the school late, but he came even later, and the first day he came girls were trying to hold hands and talk to him.  Second week he already got a gf.  But he was chill tho, definitely a bro Chad
There's more than just the trackpoint with the Yoda II. From my point of view, it's also the awesome and massive aluminium case as well as full, operating-system-independent (and rather easy) programmability.  And with the kit without switches, it's a real bargain from my point of view. Thinking if I should get another one in form of a kit. But then again, the even pricier Tex Kodachi has even more nice features from my point of view. Just waiting for the new [CandyKeys.com](https://CandyKeys.com) website to see if they also have it as kit.

Who is suggesting this should be applied to crimes in general? The "anti-rape class" approach is based partly on research that suggests that people who commit rape/sexual assault actually don't consider what they are doing to be rape/sexual assault. For example, from [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/health/men-rape-sexual-assault.html)  &gt;men who commit sexual assaults...usually deny that they have raped women even as they admit to nonconsensual sex....Most subjects in these studies freely acknowledge nonconsensual sex — but that does not mean they consider it real rape. Researchers encounter this contradiction again and again.  &gt;Asked “if they had penetrated against their consent,” said Dr. Koss, the subject will say yes. Asked if he did “something like rape,” the answer is almost always no.  This research does not generalize to other crimes. So it is not surprising that we see intervention to try to teach people what counts as rape/sexual assault and why it is bad, but we don't see this for other crimes.

r/worldnews is discussing putting Putin in front of The Hague. Now you might think that discussion would dissolve into a bunch of nonsense because no one understands International Law. You would be wrong.  Instead it has dissolved into a slap fight over jurisdiction, because no one has decided whether they are discussing the 'International Criminal Court' or the 'International Court of Justice', both of which are located in The Hague.

Acredito eu que a melhor forma de resolver esse problema é você juntar 8-10 vizinhos que tenham interesse em adquirir internet e juntos solicitarem a expansão do serviço de uma outra operadora para a sua rua!  Se a Vivo já está na rua, dificilmente vão querer aumentar as velocidades disponíveis para suprir apenas um assinante. Eles precisam do interesse de vários clientes para aumentar a disponibilidade de banda para determinado endereço.  Aumentar a rede de fibra é um negócio caro e que sem retorno razoavelmente garantido não vale à pena. O caro não é a fibra em si, e sim os equipamentos em ambas as pontas!(Na central e no armário de distribuição).  No pior dos casos, você pode falar com os técnicos da sua região e ver a possibilidade deles puxarem um link para a sua casa! Isso sai caro e depende de ter um bom relacionamento tanto com o técnico.

  &gt;using an original Pontiac GTO as the starting point.  I'd say a [65 Chevy El Camino](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/1964_El_Camino.jpg) was the starting point, seeing as how these are GM A body platforms.  Probably not that difficult of a mod to do, and would involve mating a GTO front grill and fascia or entire front clip onto what is essentially a very very similar car. The belt from the Pontiac clip would have to be carried along the entire length of the body, as on the the 63 and 64 El Camino it's much wider but not nearly as pronounced.

Right! I can’t even throw a straw wrapper out the window. I would love to meet the person just to get some sort of explanation.   We might have found each other the hard way but we’re in for the long haul! I went back and looked for mama or siblings but didn’t find any so I’m hoping this was just some sick one-off thing.

Im sorry to hear that and it must be rough but you cannot quit, just not an option. You have a boyfriend who hopefully loves you alot which in my opinion is worth more than friends.

Just hang in there, it'll get better.
So.. you have never received any information on communism except the Red Scare propaganda that exclusively tied Fascism to 'Socialism' and 'Communism' so that people ignored the fascist advancement of the US government in the 50's?  I would suggest reading up.  There have been libertarian societies. There haven't been communist societies in about 1200 years (arguably up to 3000 years if we make less guesses about genocided populations before the word genocide existed.)
Hey, if our intelligence group IS helping to screw over Trump/Russia, then I'm happy they are getting some good punches in either way :D
Trump needs to go, be impeached, but we need the Mueller report to be written, disseminated, and explained in full so that every last Trump supporter understands.  The Trump supporters are being willingly complicit in a very dangerous game of deceit, denial, obfuscation, blame shifting, etc.  None of Trump’s words or actions are genuine.  What he does is continue to sow discord among Americans and America’s traditional historic allies.  Perhaps, at the direction of Putin influence.

This has a solid foundation. I dig the direction and vibe you're shooting for, especially the flute-ish sounds and metallic percussion (has a bit of an odesza influence to it). 3:16 was an unexpected switchup (the twinkly lil synth reminded me very much of flume's newer stuff).   I feel that there are a few essential things that could elevate this track greatly. Try your hand at learning more complex chord progressions, to give a bit more expressiveness and accuracy to the atmosphere you're trying to weave. Try to have your lead synths not always exactly mirror your chords, build sounds in layers rather than the same progression in multiple layers (if that makes sense).   From a mix down standpoint, I'd suggest introducing some much needed high end to your percussion, to really give it the snappiness it's lacking. Multi band compression will also enhance this (make sure you don't over-emphasize the transient, you'll just end up making the sound less impactful). More drastic panning on synth layers rather than just perc will enhance the stereo spread of the track. A deeper sidechain over all the synths, not just the chords, may provide a better groove; ultimately there's no rules to any of this, just do what sounds best to you. Not bad at all man.  &amp;#x200B;  Mine: [https://soundcloud.com/veleko\_variants/blacklight-1/s-ZQoRl](https://soundcloud.com/veleko_variants/blacklight-1/s-ZQoRl)
Page builders like Elementor or Divi make it very easy to make many designs without custom code or custom styles, but they don't really let you make every sort of design or functionality, and they don't help make large sites manageable.  for example, elementor pro offers several styles of "testimonial slider", but there aren't enough to have an option that matches every site's intended look and feel. if you want a testimonial slider that matches a specific design or layout, you may need to re-style the normal elementor block, or you may need to build your own.  In the same way, if you have many pages on a site that need to show many testimonials in a slider, and you want to update them regularly, it is very hard to have to go to each page to change the testimonials. With custom coding, you can design features for the specific needs of each site. So, for example, you can have a custom post type for testimonials, which provides a single place to edit them, then you could have a custom block that pulls in testimonials by category, onto different pages. For a large site, that would be much easier to maintain and update than separate testimonial sliders on each page.  The last limitation of page builders is that, if you have seen enough sites built with them, the designs start to feel very similar and stale. Even with all the layout and block combinations possible with Elementor and Divi, sites tend to feel very similar and somewhat "cookie cutter".  That isn't a huge issue at certain price points, but for larger clients, you really need to be able to deliver something that feels tailored specifically unique to their brand.

I do a similar ride and have done for almost a year. Setting it in my mind as "this is how I get to work" has been the thing that keeps me getting on the bike. I have other options (public transportation) and while they can be faster, they can also be muuuuuch slower. So I just set it and forget it. It can feel like a long ride at first, but you'll level up into it can (sounds like you've done this before, so you know how it goes).   Out of curiosity, what are your reasons for picking September, and only September? Weather? Work schedule?  Have a great month!

Same here. 
The government has a history of legally imprisoning people without due process. The internment camps are one example and the civil war is another. Civil forfeiture is where the government can and will steal your money. Welcome to America. This is what happens.   I wasn’t talking about SCOTUS but the Constitution doesn’t give them the ability to declare things constitutional or not. They made that ability up and awarded it to themselves. For now, they’ve said internment was unconstitutional. They’ve also said internment is constitutional. 
I love this mentality.
The dislike of what Nathaniel represents is real and justified, especially the sexual harassment part which feels even more integral than the cartoonish contract killings.  It's good to discuss that critically.  The line I keep an eye on is judging other fans who ship trash for whatever reason.  I don't think anyone in this thread has crossed that line, maybe just toeing it a bit, a few downvotes aside.  I've seen some jabs in the past.  But I can see how it's a point of sensitivity for those who know they ship trash but also know they don't deserve to take shit over it.

I know that feel bro... it took me 4 years to realize I hate doing shitty code for others. In 4 years I've worked for 5 companies and it's always the same result, I end up hating what I'm asked to do so much that I can't even write a single line of code during my working time. As I only worked for small companies, I often had to manage servers by myself and found out I preferred doing that for work. I'm trying to get a new job as adminsys but I still love programming for myself and free softwares.   It's normal to not have the knowledge for some tasks when you're a developer, even more when it's your first year: our job basically consist of learning new things everyday. It's normal to not answer your boss when you're off working hours and to not always do working overtime, you deserve to enjoy your private life. I hope you'll find a company that will respect you as a human being, you were in a really disgusting working place.

Make up who you are, do what the fuck you want and just log back into your main when you are home. 
I was afraid of the side-effects as well. Thus far though, I haven't had many it's also helped my joint pain and all that, blood tests look better than before but I'm still flaring (now) so I'm not sure what the hell is going on, my next move would be FMT in setting of Crohn's or maybe Remicade. Uff. I don't know how you deal with it, it's soooooo hard on you. I've tried those as well, didn't help and WAY to expensive like you said... wayyyyy to expensive. At least for Humira I pay $5.00 but it's like 18k on my insurance paper. lol, per shot.

Everything I posted on Facebook when I was 13 that I try to forget, but then Facebook generously reminds me.
\#1 suggestion is to TAKE PROFITS. Sell 20-30-40% when you're up 100% in a week or two. You may miss out, but having money at the end of the day is always a good thing.
It won't be, trust me

Politics in a nutshell
Select the colonist, select their "Health" tab, and look on the "Overview" pane. It's the first option below where it tells you their gender and age, just above the row of medicine icons that you use to select what kind of medicine they're allowed to receive.  By default it's off, so you'll see a big red X above the "Defaults" button. Click it to change it to a green checkmark - that pawn is now allowed to tend themselves.  You can see it in this screenshot: https://imgur.com/ECAGef2  (Ignore our shitty camp, we were starving because toxic fallout destroyed all the food sources at my base so we had to caravan out to look for more food. Although I seriously considered eating Neal...)

What about brockers? :(
There's another cool scene where it shows Pennywise as a demon in the 1600s and kills a villager's baby. That's the kind of world building and history of Derry the movie needed.  When I wrote my IT script, Patrick Hocksetter is killed by a ton of Wolf spiders and Huntsman spiders (instead of leeches). It was so creepy writing it but damn that would've been a legit scary scene. Another scene is I have Pennywise coming out of a movie screen theater (inspired by an Are You Afraid of the Dark episode) all creepy like.  I hope to see creepy stuff like that in the sequel. Hopefully WB lets the director have more freedom now that IT was a hit.
You remind me of the babe.

Are you serious? If you are serious and not kidding then you must be incredibly biased, but perhaps that's kind of expected by the general sentiment of this sub.   A typical story is that every year many American kids discover that steaming pile of shit book named Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" and feel they're handed a secret that appeals to their low-information teenage self, who is just seeking to rebel against their parent's world view. They now feel they're in the know and can see through things and start parroting the idiotic commie pseudohistory, where USA is the evillest country in the world never done anything right.   That's very American thing especially in the internet.

Yeah if you're selling more than a couple pairs a month you will probably pass the $600. It's not too awful to claim and you don't have to write what it's from, just remember to put some money aside for this purpose. 
He does have already a decent number.  Ash, Zofia, every Frag in the game, anything that disable It (you gotta be fast After It, nothing different than acting after a Lion drone), Sledge...   It's not many, but it's more than the counters that, hell, Bandit himself has. 
Through my job I see a few provincial campsites in the Rocky region, and it amazes me that people would go to campsites there - countless huge trailers 10ft from each other with maybe 200 other trailers, outnumberimg trees 3:1. I mean if that's what you like, then go for it, but it's not for me. Give me Spray Lakes any day.

I hope so!!   The anti stance is 95% from the commercial developers in the SD area. Theres 2 major ones either side of the 8/805 junctions.. they used to be against each other in business but this one time they are working together to stop any football (I'm done using the word soccer) being played at the land. They want it for their own ideas.  I was going to a lot of the council meetings about this. Its a JOKE how corrupt/bias/bought the council members are. I learned first hand about lobbyists via this lol.  I saw a lot on facebook and twitter. I'm 'careful' with what I "like" on FB and I noticed I had liked an anti SoccerCity page. Not a chance - turns out they've been buying accounts and turning it into something else or somehow getting my like. IDK.

You mean it shouldnt also stop killing Russians just because they oppose Putin, right?
3LW with Heinen as 3C I think. 
The engines make the cars too fast, resulting in more danger. We should have a 200km/h speedlimit everywhere.
Yeah, I didn't find it that bad at all. I don't comment when people rage that "it's major surgery whhhaaaa" because they do not want to hear it _reeeally_ did not feel that bad. Felt like normal surgery. Not fun but otherwise unremarkable. I was only on panadol after my epidural and I stopped taking that less than 5 days after the section. 1 week after I was a but tender still. 2 weeks after I felt completely back to normal.
Oooh like the "I'm not angry, just disappointed" kind of belt?  Good old days!

I agree, this skin is legit becoming rare asf. I bought it when it first came out and it's been over 140+ since it re-appeared. I rarelyyyyy ever see anyone with it ingame
We are ultimately deciding not to get the amnio because I can find no reported cases of a CVS returning 100% cells affected where the fetus isn't also affected. I am still planning to consult with the doctor one more time to be sure, go over some questions I have. But I'm feeling more confident that waiting will do more harm than good.   My D&amp;E will likely be on Friday, assuming nothing comes up to make me question that decision.   I'm hurting because I feel like I didn't enjoy the last ultrasound. I didn't really get to see him and now I never will. There are all of these fears that I have for the next time. Between things that could go wrong and more petty notes, such as what if it's a girl and I feel sad that I lost my only son. I'm really pissed that I'm still feeling sick and I'll be going right back into another miserable first trimester once it's safe to try. There's more anger here than I had expected.   In the end, I know I'll survive. It could have been worse, in a lot of ways I feel lucky that we found out so quickly and were able to get in to see the MFM doctor immediately after finding out.   I'll be surfing through your post history. Reading similar stories has been helpful.
Ik how much I wanted to reach out on their birthdays...but didn't, I took the advice. Because possibly having a ruined birthday sucks. Needless to say they didn't reach out on mine either.

&gt; They give everyone stash space and for those that want they can have more if they pay, whats wrong with that? it hurts no one, it is the same as saying here have some free cosmetics but if you want more you can pay for extra costumes. Some will want to others not, hurts no one..  They intentionally give everyone a small amount of stash space to make them want to pay, when the amount of stash space is virtually free for them. It's not like stash space is a finite resource. They are limiting it specifically to make you want to pay more. It's a cash grab for a AAA game that is already full price, and it is **not** the same as cosmetics that they have to pay developers to design and render.  The Division is a loot farming game, so they restrict the amount of loot you can keep and hide more space behind a paywall. That may be fine for a F2P game, but wholly unacceptable for a full price one.
I think you highlight a rather important point. Scientifically speaking, any theory of alternative evolution or how life could/can evolve faces a major problem: We only have evidence for the emergence of life and civilization(s) on one planet and—as far as we can tell—one particular set of circumstances. Should we ever find a distinct emergence of life/civilization(s) somewhere else, or find that life emerged in some distinct manner on Earth, then the amount of evidence we have increases by 100%—that's a rather significant lack in the pool of evidence. As such, even the most speculative of hypotheses face the massive burden of zero means for verification.
Seriously, I ended up doing this two years ago. There is a shortage of affordable rentals. Unfortunately, most people looking to rent don’t have a downpayment saved up. 
I personally haven't seen comments from these divisions, can you point me to where you saw these?

You’re worried about the emotional ramifications of breaking up with your stalker?  You should be more concerned about your physical safety IMO.

Even if you didn't "know" that rule - doesn't it strike you as odd to wear white knowing that traditionally, brides *always* wear white? Isn't it weird you knew that but also chose to wear all white?

Yooka Laylee was supposed to be the new Banjo Kazooie, it was made by the people who made those games and everything. And being a dying breed doesn't necessarily mean that nobody is interested in it, dinosaurs have been dead for millions of years despite all of the people still interested in them.
It's not a fetish, people are allowed to fucking like and prefer physical games 
Okay, thanks! I will try to check it out
Seriously the women there are very violent.
Carbon Monoxide poisoning doesn't make any sense because why would she die and have visions and nausea and everything and no one else in the family?  The mother might get a pass if it's true she wasn't around the house that much, but three small kids? Even if Estefania was able to hold out as long as she could, it doesn't make sense that she would be able to only succumb to the poisoning while her baby siblings were fine.  I know they said they kept seeing things or whatever, but that's not anything compared to what Estefania endured. If anything the opposite should be true, and the children would have died from the poisoning far sooner than this teenager would have.  Upon commentary of the sick policeman, I noticed no one ever mentioned the fact that some people are very superstitious and susceptible to becoming ill through radical belief and delusion. It was a pretty fucked up scene apparently, all that religious shit and destruction everywhere, it's not uncommon for people firm in the belief of the supernatural to inadvertently succumb to illness out of an experience they believe to be tied with the paranormal.
People are overreacting to the shit show that was Season 19
