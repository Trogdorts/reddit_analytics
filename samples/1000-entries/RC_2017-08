I'm not arguing that making university free and accessible is bad. Thats incredible and done correctly it would be amazing, possibly revolutionary. My problem is that if Peterson successfully pulls off what he's trying to do, then it would be hard for him to avoid the same issues he had with the universities of today and of the last 50 years. His political influence on the subjects would most definitely shape the students of the program, which would be fine if there were alternative education systems with different beliefs, yet in this video it's clear that his plan is to eliminate his educational opposition. 
I like whisper-whistle obsessively, just barely moving enough air to make a sound. I'm sure it drives people insane.

Invasion of privacy ain't cool, and making judgements about him based on what you found is double uncool.  He can be *curious* about this kind of thing without necessarily *approving* of it or *wanting to do it*, so it isn't fair to jump to conclusions.
If the mid caps you are refering to are the Elite Force 140rd mids, they work in my Mk.I CRB, they are my backup to the G&amp;P RPS mags. When it comes to mags with Krytacs, I found that they are all different, some work with K120, others with Elite Force 140, PTS EPM, etc. IMO the best way to know for sure is to try them out, not saying waste your money, but try  them out until you've found the best one that works for you, I would say the best one, but EPMs are byfar the best

This was on some of my very early lists, upwards of 6 months ago.  Always fun when the unaffected see a brand new animal. 
Sure, but when they change in comics there is usually a "necessary" reason. Usually because the character has become stale and unpopular. For the most part, even when undergoing a lot of change, it's part of the story. It's incorporated into the continuity.   Here Domino has been changed from a bone white woman, into a black woman, and the only reason I see is to pander to people for money. You could argue that it is their job to sell the movie, I say that doing it like this cheapens the character. Makes them a token to sell tickets.   Besides, most established characters like Domino either don't change very much, or when thy do, it's because the entire comic line is changing. Like the transition form the golden to silver age. It wasn't out of place for heros to change because everything was changing. Here we have an established character being redesigned for no really good reason as far as I can tell.   As it is, I bet that people would be really upset if they made Storm into a white girl. But for some reason because Domino was made black, it suddenly no longer a marketing ploy. 
That's... a really fair point. Lol!

Is suppose it's preference. Some people may like the concept of bondage in scenarios such as the ones posted by said user but dislike the strict nature of actual restraints. Some people enjoy the strict rope. Myself, I don't like content that doesn't include any actual 'bonding' such as harnesses and shibari, but it's all encompassed by bondage in one way or another.   Like the others here have commented, you can block users if you dislike the content they post, but I don't think it's disappearing any time soon.

From what I've seen, many of the internships at industry research labs are reserved for PhD students. It's definitely possible to get one as an undergraduate if you have a strong referral (e.g., your postdoc tells his buddy at some research lab "you really should hire this guy"). I'd encourage you to ask him if he has any connections. Academia is very much about who you know.   If you want to get into a good PhD program, all that really matters is research experience (ideally with publications) and faculty recommendations. Standard software engineering internships don't really count for much at all. So, you might want to take that into consideration if you're genuinely interested in the academic path.   I would also encourage you to ask your postdoc about your chances of getting into a decent PhD program straight out of undergrad. I understand the desire to do the MS first to strengthen your application, but remember that many terminal MS programs cost money whereas PhD programs will pay you (not very much) to attend.

It's not against reddit's rules and no one cares what you think.
You have already benefited from the labor of your forebears, that is why humanity is entitled to your labor, you are tied to both your past and future within this construct called civilization. Nothing that you have now was not bought by the blood and sweat of those who came before you, you have been privileged by this and it would seem you are not aware of this. You are not an wholly an individual you are a part of humanity and you cannot separate yourself from humanity's machinations entirely, it is necessary to respect that.  I understand the Tragedy of the Commons, that is why you would need governing bodies to prevent such things. You would in essence still need a state of some variety. I'm not convinced that stateless communism will ever fully emerge, because we as humans have a great capacity to act on narrow perspectives, and we will need collective reason and authority to rein in our natural shortsightedness.  You do realize we are both arguing for cooperation right? I'm just going the extra step and saying you don't need possessions to be cooperative, you don't need that delineation between mine and yours, that delineation is what causes divide. Apathy and ill-use are bred by purposelessness, one should not find purposelessness when operating cohesively and cooperatively.  * "So what if my labor doesn't go towards everyone's benefit? Not everyone is entitled to my labor for their benefit. Would it be nice if I was charitable? Sure. But no one gets to claim the fruits of my work as their own or decide for me what the "fullest potential" of my labor is."   --Fullest potential of the hammer, not you as a laborer, is what I was stating. Your response seems to be confusing items of utility and your personal labor, I was stating if you are putting the needs of others on the same plane as your own needs as an individual it will become clear what "ITEMS" you may claim as your own personal property and what would best serve all by being utilized by all.

the model 8 .25 is viable is cqc, thats the only place it really is viable. sure you could use it outside 20m, youll be outclassed. and the model 8 .35 shares the .25's cqc dps aswell, given that they both start at 3btk. the luger 1906 and model 8 .35 are skill cannons, and yes, while not easy to use, are the best gun as their respecive ranges. most of the time the mp18'll beat the hellreigel factory and defensive(the factory variant is actually a storm variant), and it still has a lot of horizontal recoil. every other stat on the model 10 isnt that good, it really isnt op, the reason it seems op(along with the automatico) is the bad map design on objectives, where they really arent bigger than 20m across, which gives the illusion of being op, when it's really just an issue of poor mapdesign, but thats a whole other issue.   the mg15 can be used, most other lmgs have a better ttk. i honestly forgot about the bernet mercie, as i dont generally play support. but yeah its prettygood at range.   i mentioned the m1903 experimental because its pretty viable in cqc. and allows a scout to make effective use of their spot flare.

These are funny indeed, but what I remember was definitely scripted.
The influx of complaints (negative steam reviews) after Insurgency implemented BE seemed strange since PUBG, H1Z1 and R6:Siege use it but not many complaints over there. Theory goes that many of the reviews were from paid shills (new accounts) plus salty cunts that got caught cheating by it.
There's an argument against this as well. Playing numbers in Canada have fallen dramatically. In Russia and most of the former Soviet bloc they've collapsed completely. Talent doesn't get you to the NHL; it's skill *and* having the luck to be born into an upper-middle class family. At the same time, expansion has bloomed the number of roster spots available.

I think more Republicans are truly concerned about Trump than let on.  The problem is that publicly talking about isn't a guarantee to make anything better.  They are still worried about the Trump voters in their districts and backlash from the party leaders - a huge problem with Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell leading Congress. They have to toe the company line as much as possible, but they're not all complete idiots.  They know what type of person Trump is and there was a reason none of them had any interest in supporting him in the first place.  Whether Jeff Flake is truly concerned or not, its important to realize that Republicans in the Senate and House are taking a firm anti-Trump stance.  There will be more over time since the White House craziness isn't going away anytime soon, and eventually/hopefully it will reach a tipping point to get him and those complicit with him out of the White House.

I've been doing the same. Poloniex is bad news waiting to happen.
I would say the theme(s) revolve around family and communication, ultimately saying that people should communicate and be open with our problems with those we love and not running away from them. Even if the problem is with family/ loved ones, that's all the more reason to talk about things with them. Forgiveness also plays a huge role. Of course, that's just my interpretation.   It's a really slow movie, but I found it to be the most emotionally affecting film I've seen, which is saying a lot.

I have female friends, am I supposed to ignore them or not look them in the eye anymore when I talk to them?   I feel like a relationship should give you the freedom to look at an attractive person and think "*I'd have sex with that person, but I'm not going to because I'm in a relationship*". You should have enough trust in each other, otherwise the relationship will never work out.
Personally, I think it's fine. It's meant to support esports and I'm cool with that. No one should be buying every shader.. that's insane.. just spend a few bucks and buy your favorite.   I think *later* down the line though (in a month or more) Neatherrealm should consider awarding random "rare" shaders as rewards for special multiverses... however, I fully understand that with the current glitches this probably won't be a thing until they can figure out a fix so people can't exploit them.

A lot of anecdotes about a fired up defense cheering and supporting each other like crazy throughout practices.  Seems to me like a bit of a change from the past.  Who in your mind has been responsible for creating such camaraderie throughout the defensive unit.
A few years back, my uncle confessed something to my mom. He was 16 and had run away from their home near Angleton. He was picked up by a younger guy who kept telling him about his friend Dean and how they were throwing a big party and how he should join them. There'd be girls and alcohol, etc. I don't remember how, but he managed to get out of the car. Something about the guy made him uncomfortable. I guess a little bit later, he saw on the news about the Dean Corll murders and recognized the accomplice and it all clicked. Apparently it really haunted him for a long time and he never told anyone else but my mom.
yep
OP said in another comment that they know him, so presumably it was taken with his consent. Would be nice to have confirmation from /u/Tartan_Unicorn, though!

I also play both variants and I've generally performed well with the Giratina version, bats can sometimes get a little clunky. With regards to the list, I think it would be a good idea to include a Ghetsis and maybe a Shadow Triad as well. If you go first, a Ghetsis can often ruin your opponent's hand unless they have Supporters etc. In any case it's highly disruptive, even during item lock you can sometimes use Ghetsis to shuffle the items back into the opponent's deck and make it less consistent. Shadow Triad can allow you to reuse the lasers. I also run a single Energy Loto just to make sure I don't whiff on the energy, otherwise the deck loses it's purpose.

That's true, Pocono always does get big ARCA and small truck entry lists.  Most of the ARCA short track races (the "meat and potatoes" of the schedule) end up with about 25 entries, though, and six to eight of them are in the garage by lap 50.

I mean I saw more ranged heavies that you are telling me here throughout the whole match.   But old things beside. I'm a rep 23 Shinobi. If you want to learn some things, I offer my help. If you don't want it, which I can understand after this horribly bad treatment, then that's okay.
I would say the bulls, knicks, kings, suns, and nets will finish below them.  
Welcome to "American Dream" week! And no I am not kidding.
I downvoted you out of spite for that comment.
So... why exactly was he dictating a response for a meeting he supposedly wasn’t at and didn’t know about?  &gt; But within hours, at the president’s direction, the plan changed.  &gt; **Flying home from [the G20 summit in] Germany** on July 8 aboard Air Force One, Trump personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said he and the Russian lawyer had “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children”   Also interesting that this is almost immediately after [his undisclosed meeting with Putin](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-undisclosed-meeting-putin-20170718-story.html).  You know, the one that was penned in for 35 minutes and went to ~~over two hours~~ a little under an hour? The one with only Trump, Putin, and Putin’s translator present...?  *Hmmmmm...*
My original thinking was actually to take the loudness in LUFS from the right and left channels, find the difference somehow and that would some how relate to how wide the sound is? Does this make more sense? I need an abstract value, so it may turn out that the best algorithm ends up using a combination of these things.
Seriously.  When I was 18 (and I was "gifted" and in all the hard classes), I was like "derp derp science derp math derp."  STEM is *college stuff*, not high school.  Unless you're comfortable with an 18-year old designing a nuclear power plant? :-P  P.S.  You can sometimes find a full classroom set of textbooks for $50-100.  They're used, of course, but if college teaches us anything, it's that "new editions" of textbooks basically consist of nothing more than changing the font on page 942.
Very true, but some are worse than others.

Im not saying hes a sociopath and im a huge fan of Jon in the cage, but it is fucking hilarious that giving a 1 minute speech calling DC a good guy was literally all he had to do for people to be convinced hes changed.   He has been like this his entire life. People are just eating up the bullshit again like they were at the start of his career.   That said, I'll never miss a Jon fight. But I'll also never believe a word this motherfucker says, because hes been full of shit his entire career.

I would have loved to see John become more and more deluded and almost unhinged, and then have Fred call his ass out on it.  John is my favorite character ever, but I wish he could have been shown to be wrong in Halo 5.

&gt;Chips are hard to come by in Brawl Stars, and unless you have the luck of the Irish then you could be without a Legendary brawler for quite some time. Plus it doesn't seem fair that you need to trade in 100 gold and only get 1 chip back if you get a duplicate common Brawler.   Absolutely, it's very aggravating.  &gt;There should be an alternate way of getting chips besides getting duplicate brawlers.   Agree, or you should get more chips for dupes.   &gt;Here's where the Brawler Achievments come in. For each Brawler you have a set of achievements per week, or biweekly.  Sounds fun!   &gt;(Be the last hit on the Safe on heist,   No, this will encourage people to not necessarily play for their teams best result, instead waiting to get the last hit (or picking sub-optimal characters as they have high damage-per-shot, making this achievement easier.)  &gt;win a game without dying,   encourages passive/non-optimal playstyle  &gt;win a game without using your super,   Encourages people to play in a way that will damage their team  &gt;get the most kills in a game) tell me your thoughts! :)  Encourages over-aggressive play, perhaps at expense of stars/gems.  Good idea, but I think your suggestions for the quests are all flawed. No quest should encourage actions which may damage the team's chances of winning the match.

That fight changed him to the perfectionist he was. He came back and slaughtered him. Woodley vs Marqaurdt and Rory werent close at all. Lets not forget his split with Shields. Losing to serra at the time wasnt expected but Hughes was a monster back then and gsp was basically a pup at the time. Woodley lost badly to an aging recently release Nate.

Mathematically speaking, if you see that you can spread E to 2 or more people in a fight, always do it. You could have EQEQ in that window of time, but if you can EEQ you'll deal almost the same damage in total (180% Q damage vs 200% Q damage) AND you'll have the shield, movespeed and the time between your E cooldowns to reposition. If its 3 people and above, always go for it. If it's late game, and you're double tear, and you happen to see the enemy ADC got flux on him but he just stepped back, flash forward to E(spread flux onto everyone nearby) Q(duh) W auto(2 Muramana's proc) and he should probably be dead. As Double Tear Ryze late game you have a 2k HP shield on your seraphs and your overload passive when combined, so if the enemy ADC (or APC) is the only real damage threat (like Juggermaw teamcomp, tanks only exist to peel), you don't have to worry about being killed (in fact most of my flashes are used for flanks, this "supryze backline flux spread" thing and sometimes in lane). Or jist Zhonya Ult out.

To an extent, it's like a race. It's fair to say that NVIDIA is leading the GPU race. In order to pass them, you have to first catch them. Right now, AMD is trying to catch NVIDIA. It's fair to say that the Vega puts them nearly wheel-to-wheel now.   You can't come from behind to lead without first being equal.
I'm just saying out of all the things to get annoyed at Fox for doing, a different hairstyle and patch of skin is a pretty dumb thing to get worked up over.   If you're not crazy about the look, that's fine, that's your opinion, but acting like it's a Halle Berry Catwoman level of character betrayal is a *huge* overreaction. 
&gt; Does contributing to a pension actually save me more in tax,  You come out ahead with the pension because 25% of it is tax-free at drawdown, even if you don't have a lower marginal rate of tax at retirement.  You are likely to pay no tax or low single digits, during retirement, because you have multiple years of personal allowance to apply your income to.
Angus Gardner is the top SH ref right now imho and can't even get a flag?
Could be, but I think a more simple explanation is for simplicity's sake, the show never told us the name of Elia's babies and "Aegon" is a recognizable Targaryen name that no other character in the show possesses, making it easier on show-watcher.   I do hope that book Lyanna would do better than give her son a copycat name, especially when Targaryens are being hunted down. I can't see it mattering that much in the books though. It would be more thematic than practical. With 2 acknowledged, strong Targaryen claimants to the Iron throne in Dany and Young Gryff, I don't think there's much appetite for *another* Targaryen.

This made me laugh. Good use of adjectives. 
Cheers. Yeah I like all the MasterCases by Cooler Master but it was really the colour that made it stand out for me. I'd like to paint a case myself but my rooms in Hong Kong are small and without a garage or workshop I just won't be able to do it. The Silverstone fan hub is controlled via pwm but all fans will run at the same speed if they are connected to it. So if I choose a speed of 2000rpm then all my fans will run at that speed. So I can't have different speeds for the fans on each radiator or control whether I have negative or positive pressure in my case. It's not the best but it'll do for me for now. It's quite small, looks good and uses sata instead of molex which works better for me.

&gt;Basically she wanted me to be her friend, but didn't want to be my friend in return.  That's a great way of putting it. I've had to let a couple of friendships die because I was the only one putting in any effort to keep in contact with them. It's a bit sad but it's for the best, I think; your true friends are the ones that will want to be around you just as much as you want to be around them!

Well, I knew a girl from Zaire a few years back. I grew up mostly around blacks throughout my entire childhood. I know that most of Africa is blacks. If it walks like a duck....  As for Spaniards. They're Hispanic. The only thing I can go off of is the sensus bureau, and most likely what Spaniards consider themselves, Spaniards. According to the census, a large majority consider themselves white. http://statchatva.org/2014/11/04/what-race-are-hispanics/  Now I could make a fake web page full of statistics, show it to you, and you'd probably believe it. Or I could use common sense and say blacks are from Africa, and Spaniards live off the Mediterranean near Greece and Italy. I can also look at my skin and determine I'm Caucasian.

I agree it's not that Flash couldn't be changed at all or whatever, but he's a lot more than "Peter's school antagonist." The character in Homecoming didn't really resemble Flash in any way. If you're comparing to the other movie Flashes you could maybe make the argument Homecoming's is better, but comics wise no, none of the changes improved on the character at all.

Frothy said it was the best one during one of his older Tactical reviews. But I've stayed loyal to Grapple ever since the start, just way more fun and much quicker to reach places without having to learn ridiculous movement system tricks. I use it to gain speed despite often failing at it and getting stuck, and just use very short bursts of grapple to move around quicker and reach wall running surfaces.  If the telemetry showed how much I used it, it would be over 90%. I honestly can't stand some maps where I spawn far away from the battlezone so I grapple back into action.
I didnt' know that. Thank you.
True that's fair and as a pro analyst that's a good policy. I am being judgemental and wouldnt make that statement in an objective academic paper. My judgement is just based on performance and their decision to pick up idream. Literally, any up and coming player would have signaled a drive to improve and work toward a new successful style. Instead they chose idream which didn't work with their team and seems to indicate they are just having fun playing with their friends.   Yes I remember EiD is there. I also remember EiD drastically improving since joining. I also remember that HiD has three great assassin players already.   Maybe you're right on the Zuna tank. Maybe NA has gotten that much better.

Thanks for the info! Really helpful!  The iced coffee that was chalky tasting was quite bad.  The chalky flavor overwhelmed any other potential flavors. I'm not sure if it was just a different taste due to the filter because this was simply awful. From what you are saying, it seems that using a mesh filter shouldn't make the coffee *bad,* just different tasting. Perhaps the issue I ran into was a brewing/roasting issue.  I've experimented a lot with different iced coffee brewing methods (including cold brew and Japanese pour over).  I suppose my general concern when seeing coffee being served from a refrigerated container (but not cold brew as these places offer both) is that they are just brewing some hot coffee and then putting it in the refrigerator.  I've been to several places where the hot cup of coffee is delicious with many different flavor notes, but then when I've had a black iced coffee, it's like there is nothing there. Conversely, I've gone to places like La Colombe and every time my iced coffee is quite flavorful.  I'll definitely PM you about farmer's markets. much appreciated!

Max Power Limit but no overvolt = ~2Ghz, give or take a boost bin in different loads.  I don't recall, but I'm pretty sure it sat at 2012Mhz at the offset I have w/out oV.  That's not to say it wouldn't see still stable gains on less voltage (like many see with Pascal), I didn't take the time to try yet. I'm quite happy with a 2Ghz card that doesn't throttle too bad with fan speeds under 75% - this one fits the bill.  Most other Windforces I've seen seem to float in the 2025-2088Mhz windows as well under sustained loads.  So not a great or super-quiet cooler, but an adequate one.  Whoever bought a small 3-fan setup on an average sized heatsink, wanting a silent GPU when under load and OC'd w/ an aggressive fan-curve, then complains on here it's "loud" - there's a good chance they don't know what they are talking about.  If silent high-efficiency cooling was their goal - they wouldn't have bought this cooling design in the first place.

A better team top to bottom!? LMAO. You have a better offensive line and RB than us. That's it. That's literally the only thing you have better than us. We outclass you at every single other position. Oh, and LB too I guess.   What do you mean "like Romo did"? The Giants beat Romo on the path towards 2 SB's. In 2011 they swept you guys, ended up winning the division, and then the SB. In 07 the famous "WAAHHHH that's my quarterback." We swept you this past year. We'll sweep you this year too.   Eli has you guys figured out and is going to -KEEP- beating you until he retires.

It has very little to do with protecting actors or actresses. As someone else mentioned for men who were less endowed prostheses could be used, just as women's nude bodies are often altered either with make up, merkins, or digitally(this is done more and more frequently) to make their bodies more desirable. It has much more to do with the male gaze. The vast majority of TV and Movies are filmed, directed and produced by men (usually straight). Because of this most sexual content is made specifically to cater to male taste, thus women are shown fully nude much more often, and men's penis' are very rarely shown. In fact, this is even more of a problem when a show is specifically known for nudity. You mentioned Game of Thrones. The first season of Game of Thrones did actually contain some male nudity, but as the show became a phenomenon that was known primarily for two things (violence and naked women) it became more an more focused on nude women, to the point of gratuity(not that I'm complaining. I too am a straight male). There is also a generalized expectation that men enjoy sex more than women, hence why most sexual content be it in TV, movies, or even porn is catered specifically to men .   (Edit for grammar and spelling)
Can you post a pic of how you normally wear your hair out with a headband? 
Just saw a bunch of middle-aged men at 4 a.m. earlier. They were playing Tumbang Preso on the street (this was in a subdivision), swaying about and throwing their tsinelas haphazadly, and completely missing the can. Their aim was **shit**. To be fair, they *were* intoxicated and their age probably doesn't help either.   Still, I wondered how they ended up playing Tumbang Preso. How did that conversation even go? Surely it wasn't just "Hey, wanna play Tumbang Preso?" but knowing the power of alcohol, I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.   My question to you is: If you were middle-aged and had some free time, would you, with a bunch of your friends, play Tumbang Preso, Patintero, or Agaw Base?

I brought up wanting to do this to my doctor (and I had been doing it with 20mg adderall XR) and she shuttered at the thought and instead wrote a script for 4 * 10mg XR adderall a day so I could take 10mg at a time when I wanted since my schedule can vary day to day. Weird thing is I swear there is a difference... I don't feel like 10mg capsule feels the same as splitting a 20mg. Yes, I know it's a rough estimate mg-wise, but I wonder why the difference.

Yeah it happened to me. My HS &amp; freshman year of college boyfriend texted me congratulations when I got engaged.  We've been on polite if not friendly terms for the past 8 years or so. Things were a little messy when we first broke up but we do talk every once in a while and catch up.  That said I was surprised he went out of his way to congratulate me.  IMO it really impressed me how mature he was about it.  It was a fine relationship in HS but we never would have lasted long term and we are better as aquiantances now.  In your case it seems things are more recent/raw and it's better not to respond but his message seems mature and well-meaning. Maybe he truly regrets how your relationship ended but with it being so recent it's best not to engage with him.
That sounds like a fucked up way to handle politics. I'm sure most Americans aren't petty like that, but it's pretty fucked up that the politicians are like that.

&gt; in America, dozens if not hundreds of innocent black people are murdered by police without any repercussion every year.  &gt;In America, black people are more likely to be stopped by police, they are more likely to be arrested, they are more likely to be convicted, and they receive harsher sentences.  1. I think even "dozens" is an exaggeration, let alone hundreds.  2. This is statistically negligible, and doesn't even compare to the way minorities are treated in other countries.  OP mentioned a few, but there are so many more examples of ethnic cleansing, racially-motivated massacres, etc. in much of the world.  3. What you're talking about is law enforcement.  This isn't even a "western white people" thing.  Many of those killed by police are killed by black/asian/latino police.

Having friends nearby is the best course of action. I'll bet on a Spitfire in a duel, but two Spitfires versus two 190s or 109s is a different story. In the 109, you can usually climb about as well and your plane is *really* good at repeated vertical loops, and at low and mid tiers should outrun the Spitfire. Keep your distance if you're on equal footing, and seize the first opportunity to get over them by even a little so you start forcing them to bleed energy evading your repeated loop attacks.   With the 190, be mindful of your speed (you don't accelerate as well, but you should go faster in the end) and like the 109, avoid engaging until they're distracted or at a disadvantage. Instead of looping like a 109, you want to extend away further before coming right back. You shouldn't need much time on target to get the kill, and if things go south and you haven't bled your speed off too much you can disengage to reset.

That was maybe the reason why around a year ago for a few months I would sometimes wake up, gasping for air in the fear that I have stopped breathing. Everytime it was shortly after falling asleep.  I guess that my body was already asleep, controlling my breath (I know it's not the body but you get what I mean) and my brain was partially awake trying to control it, but not being able to.
The best way I've seen it done is to have the opponent go all the way do to the mat for the kick or whatever setting it up, then hit the Scissor Kick as the opponent is getting back up to their feet. Not just sit there bent over.

The NHS has psych wards?  Funny story, for years I've had crippling anxiety and depression and a very low tolerance for stress, didn't want to see a doctor because of the anxiety and because of all the bad things I've heard about the side effects of anti-depressants.  Finally had enough of work stress so went to my GP hoping to get some joy pills, only option they gave was referring myself (I mean that literally, they give you a referral letter and you have to call the team yourself to enrol in treatment) to this third party non-nhs therapy program to talk to someone about my issues talking to people.

I've used Le Volume for years.  I've tried mascara after mascara (both cheaper and more expensive) and have never been able to replicate the results I get from Le Volume.  I've tried both the ones listed below (Lash Sensational and Super Sizer) and neither impressed me much, nor did they give me the same results.  There have been some other decent (and cheaper) mascaras I've tried (Roller Lash, Kiko Milano Extra Sculpt, L'Oreal Lash Paradise) but I wouldn't consider them dupes for the Chanel since they have either a different brush or different formula (or both).  What I do is wait for the Nordstrom B2G1free sale and stock up.  They had one in May and another will be in either late fall or winter I believe.  I know it's still not cheap, but it does help with the high price tag.  I wish I could find a suitable dupe but I've wasted a lot of money trying and still haven't found one.

Okay, so let's back up then: all you've said is that having an insecure border where thousands of undocumented immigrants is "not the answer."  You admit, though, that you don't have the answer.  But you want the wall. To keep immigrants out.  This begs the question: Why do you want to keep immigrants out if we obviously have a need for them here in this country? Why not simply make it easier for them to become citizens? If you're a fiscal conservative (are you?), you're missing very basic math.  Tons of squandered crops = bad  Spending tons of taxpayer $$ on a wall = bad (if you believe in less spending, of course)  Let immigrants in, make them citizens, and we need no wall, so we save $$, plus crops get picked, plus tax dollars from labor = good.   The only arguments for not allowing immigrants in are generally couched in racism or ignorance. If the economic arguments don't make sense, how can fiscal conservatives still support a border wall?
One reason I believe the album is getting torn apart so much is that we had to put up with a tacky marketing campaign that started out funny but got tiresome close to the release. Many people were rationalizing it would pay off with the album, but instead we got the most heavily marketed AF album with the worst content. I liked the tracks everything now, electric blue, put your money on me, and we don't deserve love, and think they would make an excellent 4 track EP, however the rest of the songs honestly hurt to listen too, knowing this is the same band that made 4 fantastic albums.

Did you end up being lynched? Also I enjoy your stories a lot so I started doing the same about my own interesting games. 
They just released vega. with their budget you want them to pull new uArch out of their ass? Common! RTG is squeezed for budget they don't have the budget nvidia does for their GPUs to pump a new uArch every 18 months. Sorry. They are too far behind in both power and performance. AMD simply can't pull Navi out of no where if its not ready! Even then I think RTG is in their own bubble now and they have given up the gaming field to Nvidia for now. You know when your product sucks and can't compete you ignore every fact and talk good about it. Its like Trump! Everything is fake other than the stuff he makes up in his head. RTG is the same, no matter how much more power vega uses and how late they are they won't acknowledge it. I think they won't be competitive for a while. It looks like RTG is making bulldozer equivalent of GPUs and AMD CPU division is more competitive probably because of it.

I wouldn't say it would 100%  eliminate it, but yes there might be a drop in single players playing squads initially.  There are many workarounds, I'm just saying that Bluehole is handling it poorly and should either alter the in-game rules, or drop the topic altogether, but banning people on a first offense for doing something the game allows and doesn't even warn against is very bad community management.  I like the removal of the ability to harm a downed opponent, but I think a better solution is the traitor mark as well as a solution that someone else described to me recently:  &gt; when a teammate kills you then you have the option to deny them your lootcrate. That way they have nothing to gain from it other than the fun of killing teammates. When a person has a number of reports and were denied lootcrates with each kill, then a ban is obvious.  At the very least though: in my opinion there should be an in-game warning about team killing and no one should be banned for the first offense or even handful of offenses.   In League of Legends when you go to rage quit, there's a warning against it. In PUBG the end game screen when you team kill should have a warning in a bold red text   &gt;We noticed you friendly fired a teammate this game. Just so you know team killing is unsportsmanlike and repeated offenses *may* result in a ban  Obvious bans would only happen after a number of reports, and reports would only happen to intentional trolls (more often than not). But this first offense ban nonsense is bullshit. 
But are they allowed to kick someone out just for playing the game really well?
&gt;You never ever use the "MWD+cloak" trick on a ship that uses a covert-ops cloak and has a align time of under 10s, because its does not help you in any possible way imaginable.   You should really work on your reading comprehension, because I gave you a scenario where this maneuver absolutely gives you an edge.   But let's break it down a bit more for you with two scenarios:   You jump a gate, everything seems clear, and you initiate warp and cloak. During your align a sabre decloaks and bubbles you, and your warp is canceled and you now move at ~30m/s and dropping (basically w/e speed you were traveling at when the warp was canceled). You can't activate any prop mod because you are cloaked, your max speed is ~300m/s. This gives the sabre a fairly small sphere of space in which to decloak you.   I, however, never initiate warp and use the trick. When the bubble goes up it has zero effect on me, and I will continue to build speed. This high speed makes that "where could I be?" sphere in space much larger, making decloaking much harder. It's not about how fast the sabre is, it's about maximising the area of space I can actually be in. If you had a spoon of lucky charms with one hidden marshmallow, and I had a large bowl with one hidden marshmallow, who do you think would find the marshmallow first?

Seems like you actually understand them all pretty well from your summaries. One thing I will say about Penelo though is that you may have overlooked her relationship with Larsa. She is the one who initially sparks his realization that the Empire's course may need readjusting and basically catalyzes the future of peace he begins to pursue between Archades and Dalmasca. He'd never had the chance to speak to a normal person from Dalmasca before he met her and it made him realize how out of touch his initial perspective was.  Furthermore Penelo just wants to go wherever Vaan's going, and so if he wants to keep flying with Ashe, Balthier and co. then of course she's going to stick with him.  And then the ending scene with the letter she writes to Larsa is actually a callback to Cara's letter to Mid in FFV, which is pretty cool in and of itself despite the sappy J-pop song.  The game has a lot of subtlety to its character interaction, arguably to a fault because it's difficult if not impossible to get a full picture on the characters after just one playthrough. The more times you play the game (or even just read the script) though, the more nuances you pick up on. For instance, Vaan and Penelo probably bond the most with Basch over the course of the story as he sort of adopts the role of guardian/chaperone to them. It's never explicitly stated or given its own scene, it just sort of becomes evident throughout the seemingly innocuous side interactions that dovetail various big scenes.  FFXII is a game that has to be studied like a play to be fully understood, and its characters have to be viewed like a web with consideration to how they all interact with each other rather than isolating each one into a vacuum for individual analysis.  Also the next time you play, something you might enjoy is to keep a running tally of how many times Ashe tells Vaan not to interrupt her. Like, the stuff you were talking about in his paragraph is deliberately acknowledged by the game's writers and it's hilarious. Vaan tries to pipe up with something relatively pointless and Ashe will be like "stfu kid the grownups are talking." It's fucking savage and the most underrated comedy in FFXII.
Oh I know it's a stupid in joke that someone on Twitter made.  She occasionally shows up in Nashville I don't live far away.

The German totally adds to it I think. It's not an "action" movie, and in many ways it's not a traditional "war" film, it's about people and tension, claustrophobia, immersion, etc. I think that English in bad German accents would detract from it (like it would if Hunt for Red October wasn't a popcorn film). I know some struggle with subtitles of course.  I liken Dunkirk to Das Boot in many ways.

Loss was a comic by CTRL+ALT+DEL. It's generally considered the high point of bad webcomics because the author mentioned that a character was pregnant, promptly forgot about it forever, and then out of the blue, tried to drop a serious webcomic about a miscarriage. It did not go over well, and has been parodied by the internet mercilessly.

It also has a lot of issues with its targetting system. I tried playing it a couple months ago and noticed in the undead burg that with sorceries it'll lock on to whatever it wants to rather than what you're directly looking at.  There's also this weird thing where if a small enemy is a certain distance from you,  you'll fire over their heads when locked on instead of firing down. Those reasons, among some others just make me really dislike the game and I can't bring myself to finish it. Sure, I could play as a melee class instead but that takes away all the fun for me if I'm forced to do it a particular way.
apply and try to hit people up directly. dont ask for a job from them, ask for advice on landing the role. hit up a recruiting agency and see what they have (this is usually free on your end, company pays for recruiting firm to source talant.) Tune up your linkedin and get the top subscription so you can inmail people. keep going its not easy. look at your local real estate meetups and go there and introduce yourself. if the person cant help you he will prob know someone that can or at least guide you in the right direction in terms of where to look and apply. get infront of peeoples faces and be agressive, nobody cares about you if you dont put yourself out there. if you need help or have specific questions on how to frame emails or templates or if something doesnt make sense dm me.

No joke. After completing our snapshot to an offsite NAS, I would just walk up to the server and remove a working drive. This tested many systems at once. I could see how long our monitoring system would take to find the offline drive, see how long our T1 helpdesk took to receive and acknowledge the high priority ticket that was automatically created and then see how long it would take them to call one of the senior techs and tell them what happened. We treated a drive in a array going offline like the POTUS would treat a nuke launch. I've pulled engineers off other sites to send them to a client with a bad drive before. 
Well, I'm convinced

It really comes down to something a lot of people sort of kinda ignore.  Roe vs Wade is an effective right to an abortion, but it isn't an outright statement of a right to abortion.  It's more of a right to medical privacy to have a medical procedure.   So if you are medically emancipated, you have this right. But sometimes you can lose your right to medical emancipation. It's actually an important distinction used very occasionally.  A big one would be circumcision, where you have absolutely no legal or medical emancipation whatosever at all ever. Other times would be when hospitals and courts "act on your behalf" against your parents wishes.

The word "please."  It's manipulative and *usually* pointless in spoken language.  The only time I think it makes sense is if you accidentally let your tone or word choice come off as demanding. It doubly annoys me that I am going to have to teach my kids to use it because some assholes will pull out the "What's the magic word?" on them.
Hey friend.  #1 - have you emailed your professor to ask if you need the newest edition or if it's required in class. If neither are true, find the older edition if needed online if at all possible. #2 - do you even need these books?

Here are my three go-to questions:  1.  What do you like to see in your successful teachers? Or what does it take to be a successful teacher in your school?  2.  If I were to contact some of the teachers at your school, what would they say about working there? (If you ask this question actually email some of the teachers in the grade level or subject area that you interviewed for and see what they have to say).   3. What kind of science extra curricular activities does your school offer that I could become involved in? (My specialization is science so tailor this question around what your specialization is).   The first question shows that you're interested in improving yourself and working towards being a better fit for the school. The second question shows that you care that you find a school that is right for you and not just jumping at the first opportunity that comes up. It also lets you know what the principal thinks her teachers think about her and then you can find out what they actually think by asking them yourself. The third question shows that you're willing and excited to get involved in things outside of teaching at that school. Principals want people who will be willing to work the extra curricular activities in addition to teaching.

Would you consider adding a more expensive upgrade to the scroll? When the patch notes teaser came out I was pretty hyped for it to work the way it initially did, but now it's not really useful to me. I was excited for having an extra bonus gatestone to a fixed location, but now I'll probably end up gating the smuggler anyway.
Cómo te va escuchando? Eso es lo malo que tienen muchos profes de inglés, que tienen tan poca fe en su capacidad de enseñar que ni siquiera se esfuerzan con la pronunciación. 
You're right. Not worth the price hike going based off the MSRP ($64) but at $82 it'd be a nice upgrade. 
Maybe we can use these tactics to our advantage and start infiltrating the two corporate parties with undercover Berniecrats. They can sell themselves as champions of the status quo to get into office and then turn around and betray the corporatists when it comes time to vote.

Depends on the song for me. If I can't understand the lyrics (eg. Red Lights by Vib Gyor) then I don't mind, same if I don't mind the meaning of the lyrics. But if the lyrics are about something that makes me uncomfortable or something that annoys me (bragging etc) then it's off putting enough that even if the music is nice the lyrics will ruin it.

I'd think the Aqualad Traitor-Tigress plot was much bigger than SB-MM. I think Green Beetle is where it deviated from reasonable to unecessary focus.   Its to be expected that blue gets focus on his character origin story, which is essentially what the season was. Even though Asami &amp; the others were some of my favorites of the season they probably could have been left to the Metatrafficking Season and theyd have had more time to work on those that needed it making it feel like a Blue Beetle show.

Your last sentence is exactly why women seeking sterilization get so defensive. Many times, a woman has to go through 4 or 5 doctors before even finding one who will simply listen to her. A lot of us have BINDERS full of studies to back up the reasons for seeking sterilization, and too often, it just doesn't matter. Being condescended to as an adult woman is incredibly insulting, and people tend to revert to that when they find out you want to be sterilized, physicians included. My doctor took the time to talk me through the options, but accepted it when I gave her logical counter-arguments. I was honestly glad she was taking it seriously enough to offer options. It is surgery, and shouldn't be taken lightly. 
That's what I figured as well. All I remember was 3.5 in high school and I thought it was weird they wrote she in the manuals.
Do Americans ever realise they aren't the only country in the world?
Only in the case of major damage or harm (even potential), but if threaten them the first time it happened.  Don't threaten to hurt them, take a picture and tell them you're going to sue their parents if they hurt you or your car.  You can find out who they are thank t the photo.  But only if they are being dangerous.  Otherwise the worst d do is encourage them to get filthy while having the time of their lives.

It's Berserk. It buffs our raw attack power number by 30%(2000 attack power goes up to 2600 attack power for that 20s) not potency of attacks which puts us closer to DPS level attack power letting us break 20k Fell Cleaves and Upheavals rather easily.

Plausibility - 7, definitely feels realistic but probably going to be a hatsu of an one-off character.  Strength - 5, due to memory overload and hatsu proficiency, I don't see the user being able to win in most straight up fights with it.   Adaptability - 9, since versatility is the main point of this hatsu, its only natural that it scores the most in this aspect. It has something to assist in movement, defense, and resource collection on top of its primary purpose of being a weapon. What a lot of people aren't realizing is that not only does it work well in close combat as a buzz saw and long range as a laser, you can also potentially use it as mid-range bladed projectile by creating larger than normal fan blades and amping up rotation before flinging at your opponents.   Cooperability: 3, Definitely feels more like a hatsu used in one on ones since the fans and laser could possess danger to allies in crowded situations. Not to mention there really isn't any aspect of the ability that can work well off other hatsus.   Room for Development - 4, this sort of hatsu is going to have low room for development for the same reason why it has low strength. Too many hatsu categories are being used in it.  Emission Focus - 4, Similar reasoning as for Strength and Room for Development, too many hatsu categories. While emission is definitely the lynchpin of this hatsu, the severe need of transmutation and manipulation to work dilute the focus of it.  My comment: This hatsu would work much better as a pure Emission or pure Conjuration since you can reasonably do all the things with manipulation and transmutation within either categories and simply add the lasers through limitations. Also if you are going through the emission route, not having a handle and instead making them float with be much more dangerous and simple as that way you can make more elaborate defenses and have higher proficiency in mid-range combat. 
It can be influenced by a lot of things, from diet, exercise to simple biology and hormones that flare up.

Um, what? Living as a woman has nothing to do with whether other people recognise me as a woman, though. Being treated however people in your culture treat a woman? Yes, that's dependent on interaction with people. And yes, that can affect aspects of your life, of course. But living as a woman, doing innately woman specific things, is ultimately limited to reproductive and physical aspects.   If I lived alone on a desert island and never saw another human being, I would still be living as a woman, and experiencing woman-specific things.

From what I was told, the FAA doesn't care about airspeed in this case. Nowhere in 91.119 does it mention speed or trading speed for altitude. It only mentions altitude. Something similar came up in a training session (it was to do with aerobatic flying) and the CFI didn't know the answer so he contacted the FAA. From what he told us, the FAA rep said it refers to the current altitude, not what could be attained (potential altitude) because that might not come to pass.

If the judge lets him off light (let's face it, trial in Tuscaloosa, it's going to be a light punishment on the legal side. Probably like 30 hours of community service and shadowing a cop for 10 hours or something), I really hope it's on the merits of how the law itself (DUI while not driving) doesn't really help anybody and not because he's a football player and he works really hard in other aspects of life (looking at you, Cam Robinson)

I feel like you have excellent insight.  Your dad sounds jealous of your success.  Any ammo you give him, he uses to push your buttons.  You told him you need to relax, and that's when he explodes and makes your already nervous self more nervous, so you can screw up the test and he can be smug and knock you down to his level-but my guess is that he would never take the blame for this.  What you are doing is good.  You've heard the term no contact before here, I'm thinking the less contact with him, the better.  Also, maybe talk with a professional counselor.  They can be very helpful.

He didn't expect to be president, he doesn't know how to be president, and he doesn't care about being president outside of it's ability to make everyone focus on him and drive his own ego. It's exactly what it looks like. It always has been.

I was at a party, my friends were all getting lucky with girls after girls, and I had been rejected for the third time that night. So this really not attractive girl just jumps on me and starts kissing me, for one nanosecond I was like "Holy shit, this girl is abusive, I should push her away", then I was like "Nah, fuck this shit, I'm not leaving this place without a kiss"
ok thanks anyway bob

I used to catch the train to work &amp; enjoyed blocking out other commuters with my headphones.   But, for the walk to -from the station I enjoyed the sounds of nature / life. It also allowed me to think &amp; daydream without the music in my ears.
No. Lol. But this was funny. Credit yourself for making me laugh (and I have not laughed much lately). Great job on day 16. Rage is probably less dangerous than despair when it comes to relapse risk.  Fuck that guy!
&gt; I know I beat the original main storyline and was moving through the quests that come before Heavensward. My last goal was getting the Ironworks set....but I don't know what I should be doing if I jumped back in.  You'd still be working towards the same goals, actually! Continuing the MSQ is always a good goal to have, and getting Ironworks (and then augmenting it) is something every fresh 50 should be working towards. I talked more about how to do that [here]() just now, if you need a refresher.  You may want to run through the Hall of the Novice to remind yourself of your class's basics and of how dungeons work; it also rewards a nice XP boosting ring if you wind up wanting to level any other combat classes.  &gt; Additionally, I think I read a couple weeks back about some Realm transfer incentives. Are those still active and something worth looking into?  It's probably not worthwhile for you - there's a bonus for transferring from any world to a new world, but the only new worlds are on the European data center, so that's not a good idea if you're in NA. There's also a bonus for transferring from a congested world to a preferred world, but Hyperion isn't a congested world. You can read more [here](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/5e1a319accdb6ec98b54ef82e35d22338cf55ce7).  &gt;PS: Is there anyway to review the story (spoiler-free) up to a given point besides through the quest log in game?  I'm sure you can find some stuff if you google around, but there's also the book in the Inn, which lets you re-watch any cutscenes you've unlocked.
As a support main, I CANNOT STAND that passive. It's infuriating.

I for one am definitely not digging for reasons, some are just too big to ignore. Personally I don't mind any of the logistics involving the Greyjoys, but I can see why others do (Dorne is on the way to Casterly Rock by sea so how was Dany's fleet even separated when Euron attacked?). What I really can't suspend disbelief on is that the Lannisters who've been at war almost all of the series just roflstomped the Tyrell forces *in a siege*. I don't care if they got Tarly, you don't win a castle siege without some incredible trickery, diplomacy or an overwhelming numbers advantage and extremely heavy losses. They made it clear with dialogue that it just came down to straight fighting and the Lannisters won easily. At this point, it's impossible to speculate about any battle because it's clear that all rules have been thrown out the window in favour of "the side will win that the plot demands and we won't even pretend to justify it".

Its currently being worked on and more sizes are added frequently. If yours isn't available yet all the data comes from bratabase.com, so you can still find it it just won't be conviniently laid out like it is here. Not all sizes have lots of data tho, if you have a size that doesn't have a lot of data please add your bra measurements to bratabase! =) also you can look at the data for sister or close by sizes to get an idea of what bras in your size might be like, they aren't exactly the same but they're often pretty similar.

Renegade marines have fallen from the Imperium for various reasons, but have not necessarily (yet) fallen to Chaos. Many renegades do end up turning to Chaos, but there are renegade marines like the Knights of Blood who claim to still be loyal and fight for Imperial interests. The Knights of Blood came to defense of Baal with all the other Blood Angel successors, but then got the hell out of there before the dust settled.  The same goes for Imperial Guard and the like, there can be renegades who have not fallen to Chaos - Imperial secessionists are a somewhat common thing and can be untainted by Chaos, or they can be thoroughly corrupted. The Imperium will still try and bring them to heel all the same.
I agree, but do you go with the bad reality TV angles WWE does, or do you book it more like a sport like NJPW and would that be successful in the US?
She wouldn't necessarily have time powers like Max, though. Dontnod have said that Max's powers are like an extension of her personality and who she is, slow, methodical, afraid of making a mistake and always wishing for the perfect outcome. Rachel isn't that, in fact she's almost a complete opposite so I don't think she would have Max's powers.   On the other hand powers that would suit both her personality and who she was (which was a model, as opposed to a photographer like Max) would be a charm-like power that made everyone in love with her and that made everyone see her in the best possible light. That feels more Rachel powers instead of handmedown Max powers.

Now, we *could* do that, but Singapore is a country built on immigrant labour. There always has to be someone doing the blue-collar jobs. (would you want to be a FCH from FASS and end up driving buses?)  That, along with the fact that our fertility rates are one of the lowest in the world, leaves the government little choice. Unless you want them to legislate "three or more" into law and force everyone to get married by 35?

However, as well as the interviewer wanting to know that you can program, they also probably want to see _how_ you program and deal with future problems -- Making FizzBuzz with just a switch-case for all 100 cases is the least future-proof while having a solution like Tom had near the end of the video is definitely scalable. It's good to make things as easy to improve and fix in the future as possible, and showing in the interview as if it's no big deal for any future projects either can definitely improve your chances of getting hired. 
While I do understand that you can / could get to many buffs to show, why not making the stacking smart? As in if the buff is passive, like from a monk or crusader or other item, then it would stack with others like that, and if that isn't enough then keep stacking less important buff together. It's just a little weird that 2 buffs gets put into the same icon, while I wanna see how much time I got left.   Just an option to turn it off would be nice, but I guess i'll have to press the keybinding for expand and collapse buff icons.   And thanks for the explanation.

With an email list of 10K .... **why** would you need a publisher?  Say only half of the list converts (buys) every time you release a new book and announce it to them.  (($2.99 * 5K)*.7) = $10,465.  Unless you are a celebrity or otherwise in a position to have a powerhouse Hollywood agent who can land a six or seven figure book deal for you ... there is no publisher anywhere that will pay you even a third of that ten thousand you just made.  "But royalties!" will be the response.  "The advance is just that; but the publisher will pay royalties too, so you need to add that in."  Okay.  8-10% is typical.  And returns (the unsold books the stores order and then send back to the publisher) are often charged against your royalties; making you pay for the system that encourages stores and publishers to not think or plan strategically for how they sell books.  There is a reason only a very, very, very, **very** small percentage of traditionally published writers earn enough from their traditional publishing to live off of.  As in, a single digit percentage number of the trad writers.  And finally, if your email list can consistently push 5K sales, that's going to do amazing things for your rankings.  Making your books extremely visible, which puts it in front of a lot of non-list customers.  Some of those will buy too.  Their buys will help your titles maintain or improve their rankings, which creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.  Any would-be writer who has the luck or skill or whatever black magic necessary to become visible enough to be interesting to a trad based solely on the visibility does not need the trad.

That's a lot of pressure on someone so young. Make a list of things that you like or would like to do, talk to people doing those jobs, and whittle it down.

Metallic and Chromatic dragons differ in where their power comes from and why they are chromatic or metallic. Originally, they were completely non-magical beings of boring colors and firebreathing glands. Then, a subset of dragons was infected with a nanobot virus. These dragons became metallic and got "magical" powers from the nanobots. To keep from getting this "illness" dragons pretty much literally made a deal with the devil and began injecting genetic material of demons into themselves, gaining a measure of their psionic abilities, these dragons became the chromatic dragons.

helmet hair - the issue only brought up by people trying to justify MHL to trivialise the issue.   Take a really good look at Australia's ratings on cycle safety - MHL has a huge part of why we are at the very bottom. Get rid of the ridiculous law, get more people on bikes, suddenly they aren't an outgroup to be close-passed and taunted, they are people. on bikes.  It really shows how people assume what they grew up with is right and normal when we are a massive outlier in this regard and held up as an example of how to make cycling more dangerous in the rest of the world.

Why do you think this is the reason your game lags? A game shouldn't take 100% of your ram. Open a bunch of sites on chrome and a game and see if you go above 53%. What settings is your game at? A10 + 1050 is a decent set up for games at medium settings but I wouldn't expect anything brand new to play on high or ultra. Also very weird combo on processor / video card. The A10 is a good little hybrid unit but overall isn't stupid powerful. Is it possible though maybe your game is using the built in graphics of the A10 and not your 1050. Just throwing ideas out there.

Sounds like you both have some toxic communication patterns. It doesn't make you bad people necessarily, but it's best to get it checked out by a couple's counselor or with some books on effective arguing skills.
Frontier!
The answer is usually because they're bad, and that's fine. Not everyone has to go for WR, and if you're not going for it guaranteed PB is probably more important to you than a chance at a slightly better one. People who are genuinely good at optimized speedruns don't do this.

The basic and Critical versions are considered separate bonuses so the cap for one doesn't apply to the other. Since they are multiplicative reductions, the diminishing returns are built in where they interact.  Since the effect values when Special Effects (Critical) is working are not directly shown, I don't know if it bypasses the diminishing returns but my guess would be they still exist.  I'm away from my item box at the moment farming a revenant for Ethereals (ugh, these rates suck), but I do believe the (critical) versions have the same breakpoint of 40%, further contributions halved. I honestly wouldn't use the Critical versions at all outside of full Fanatic, the returns will be dinky with just accessories accounting for increasing it. You'd be better off just using the regular ones twice since they'd always be on.  The only stats I know of with a breakpoint like this are Evasion and Dash stats.

I have little to add to this post as it's almost completely perfect. I especially agree that experienced players need to be giving input on the balancing side of things. And not just one or two, either - to get a better perspective overall then dedicated players who frequently talk about the game inside and out while also being skilled should have their opinions being taken into consideration. At least for Ranked, specifically.   One thing though - the youtuber promotion is sadly a good thing. Yes, it causes a lot of stupidity and toxicity, but a lot of players wouldn't be here if not for that introduction. (Myself included - here from TrumpSC.) At the end of the day, BMG wants to make money from this and appealing to a wide audience of both hardcore and casual players is the best way to do this. Serious players will find their way into Ranked.  Apologies if this comment sounds stupid, I'm drunk as fuck. Praise autocorrect.

Not sure but I highly doubt that there are any other more salacious news organizations spewing inciteful messages from within Israel's own borders. Because the Al Jazeera name carries with it a gravitas of legitimacy, which it has earned through credible reporting elsewhere, it is perceived to be a generally credible source. Reality is, Al Jazeera is great on 95% and rabid on the Israel - Palestine question. I understand your point of people deciding what they want to hear and going somewhere else for it - but let that somewhere else be a known Hamas mouthpiece rather than from an otherwise respected source where people believe its credible info.

&gt; people had been waiting months for  Yep. I think you're right about that. They've had all this time (over a year) to hone on the jokes, writing and plot lines and we get a generic episode with no real point.   I rewatched the episode and a few of the jokes were a little too on the nose, which I think shows should avoid if they want to be timeless. I liken it SOMEWHAT to the GoT episode with Ed Sheeran. Pop culture references don't fit in the world (might be wrong but I don't watch GoT so I'm going off to backlash).
Well it has been a legit problem in the past years, this year being an exception doesn't change that. It also wasn't predictable that it would be so easy this time around, hence the hindsight comment.

Holy shit you're actually clueless. Also, cute strawman.

Mere spectator? Do you assume I'm not praying? I don't need to say any set words for my prayer to be United to the priest. If I sat there and only watched, you might have a point, but no one who frequents low Masses is doing that - it would be the most boring and monotonous thing ever.  I don't need to be given a spoken formulaic part to feel I am connected to the Mass. I do not need to be given little bits and pieces to feel special. I am participating more by praying fervently than I ever would by repeating words I've memorized while my mind runs blank.

Ace high are among the worst hands in your range. You are going to have AT, TJ, 9T, maybe A6, 56 to call down with in that spot.  You don't need to bet river to make flush draws fold. Flushes are below average hands in that board because any value hand is at least a full house.
&gt; May I ask where you think that isn't happening?   It's happening, but it's not scientists doing the communicating so much as science journalists, and I think that many science journalists aren't very good at getting at the nuance of current scientific debate. In  particular, I believe many debates (such as climate change) have gone poorly because the message is that the science is settled, which is incorrect, and should have been more about the strength of the evidence that things are going badly wrong.   &gt; As an aside, I'd also be interested in knowing what scientific field you are in.  I do research for a large corporation, broadly related to computer science and physics. Fortunately it's not in a field containing many ethical dilemmas.

A good option is to talk to China about reunification. Are they completely against it? Maybe hang the possibility of withdrawing US forces from South Korea after reunification.  I mean China, if its intelligence community is at least a bit competent (we don't know it, but let's bet that it is), would most probably already have a lot more plans on how to make reunification happen than the US does. They would have a lot more intelligence on North Korea, would be in contact with the other higher-ups in the country's political and military elite who could possibly stage a coup. The biggest reason for North Korea's existence supported by China is to be a buffer state against U.S. forces, and the biggest reason for U.S. forces existence in South Korea is due to the threat of North Korean invasion. If America can trust China enough to do a tit-for-tat, the North Korean problem could be solved without any nukes dropping anywhere. But it's really up to China, and South Korea getting on board with such a proposal.  The thing is, this solution makes a lot of sense to me but would probably be so unpalatable to Washington war hawks who want bases everywhere on Earth that it wouldn't happen.

Exile the first 2 non-land cards from your opponent's deck would only be good if they didn't shuffle afterwards and you could mana-flood them for a few draws, but even then that's a relatively weak tempo play and not enough to make milling a concern.

WHAT are you kidding me?!?! I am in shock right now holy crap...You paint so beautifully.  Thank you so much, you kind, talented, good pizza. &lt;3
There has always been bad rap and there is still lots of good rap, but to be fair the 90s are pretty hard to match. The list of albums that came out in 94 alone is mind boggling.

I think someone's super stupid. I don't open packs, I'm not a gambler who wants to throw away money on lottery tickets. Hell, this could be completely fake and we have no way of knowing. Where's the video of him opening the box? And where's the pics of the boxes that are below average? No, this just contributes to confirmation bias and is actually harmful to the community.   There are good reasons other subs ban these kinds of posts. 
The problem isnt the fact that it requires a smart phone, the problem is that it requires the internet.   I'm big into smart home / home automation and I see this a bunch there. All these companies want their hubs and devices to be connected to the internet for control. Fuck that. I run my own hub on my own server in my basement. All my smart devices are local control. The internet can go down and I can still turn my lights on.
My partner helpfully pointed out one day that whenever I'm showing someone how to do something, I don't actually instruct - I just visually show them and say "and like so..." for every single step.  Had no idea, but I'm constantly catching myself now.
Im mp 1000 and i hate joining games in progress
Personally, if I were to be a little bit safer, I'd actually exchange one of the Skull Invitations (which you called Skull Judgement) with the copy of Coffin Seller you can get from Marik. It has a similar effect to Skull Invitation, except it only deals damage to your opponent whenever a monster is sent to the Graveyard.
When I was in IET we had to change in the bathrooms because we had female drill sergeants "who might walk through at any time." People got away with changing by their bunks sometimes but if a DS saw you so much as taking your ACU top off in the bay they would lose their shit.
There's one in Yggdrasil, marked by a comm station
Se você não elaborar mais suas respostas, não dá para discutir. Aí fica parecendo que você só está querendo me contrapor.
That's insane tbh, does your job require you to be in LA or could you leave and find work?  Note taken to stay away from LA
Remember when auctioneer was a terrible card until the standard change? I think we just need to wait for the next one when the coin and some of the value 1 cost spells rotate out so that we can see how well auctioneer can perform without extra coins
I think it's referring to stock Android. Some OEMs already include this feature, I think even my LG Flex 2 had it.  
No, that's a snake.
I hear camping at the dragon summon at Supply Depot is pretty good with decent guns (mk3)
Keep watching it for a few days to make sure it's still dead
That sucks. I'm helping plan one too. [Here's my vote for a shower game.](https://www.etsy.com/market/labor_or_porn) 
ya it is.  per the band, it means "a message from another world/dimension"
Yea I would have had no problem with that he was acting like he was bout to leave the session and we hadn't friended each other. He was gonna do the solo lobby glitch by changing his wifi code or whatever and then I would not have been able to get him
Dana working double duty tonight to get that overtime cheque lol.
Thank you sir!  This was insanely helpful, in particular to the link the YouTube channel.  I've been watching his videos for the last 3 hours while downloading tiles for Ortho4XP.  Seriously - thank you so much.
It would also match this ti's aquatic theme.

Where was this?
Belly dancers would like a foie gras goose.
Minor Slayer works on the skeleton.  Also, the 5% bonus is additive with other percent damage bonuses (CP, Minor Berserk, execute bonuses like Impale or Radiant, etc.)  So say you've got some attack that does 10,000 damage with no bonuses. Then add some damage done bonuses ... let's say 40% from Minor Berserk and CP. So now the attack does 14,000 damage. Minor Slayer would buff that to 14,500 (10000 * 1.45), not 14,700 ((10000 * 1.40) * 1.05) as many expect.
