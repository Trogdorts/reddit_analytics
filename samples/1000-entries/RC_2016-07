Not in the Midwest where there's grain production.  10 to 12 thousand per acre here and up to 20 thousand per acre for irrigated in Nebraska. 
Very interesting.   I actually had this thought about a year ago and how it could come to fruition. Guess we aren't far off from starting the zombies! 
What's bugged about it?  Haven't kept up on melee skills. 
Aw man... I feel you. 
Depends on whether you like the directing or the story. Studio tend to hire the familiar people, but it's best to keep tab on the key staff instead
no, but it means that the others don't understand their platform/his platform enough to convince.   i can be a shitty debater, and probably still prove that humans tend to be altruistic, but put me against some debater who I think is clearly wrong, and he'll have some points I can't disprove.

oh no!! Dairy products on sale are the worst temptresses. We'll just have to hang in there until science catches up. (maybe they can utilize CRISPR to give people the LCT gene artificially? who knows)
Ditto, Bandwidth difference for 75hz vs 60 is negligable at best, an HDMI should be able to handle 1080p decently, but 1680x1050 is absolutely fine for HDMI (Even though I don't personally prefer HDMI, purely because of how prone the cables are to breaking, my 1680x1050 monitor is on a dual-link DVI w/ my 144hz 1080p on Display Port. I'm using HDMI for my 32 inch TV which acts as a 3rd monitor and the HDMI cable has broken 3 times purely because of my cats walking over it.

There is absolutely nothing that indicates they're being sequestered. In fact the opposite is true, as Glenn did several interviews about his time in the BB house, which indicates there is no such sequester.
Matz still had the third best AB of the night. 
Sorry I just copy and pasted your comment, didn't noticed it didn't post your name.
The 390 is a pretty good deal. It's equivalent to the new rx480 people are recommending, but at a cheaper price. It should be fine for 1080p gaming for a couple of years.
And the championship. And the rest of english football.
Yep, I grew up buying some of my own school shoes and books, now it's hard for me to spend money on things I want without feeling guilty. It's called lack mentality or poverty consciousness... there are apparently things we can do to change these mindsets.   E.g.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brad-yates/watch-lack-mentality-pove_b_5679690.html  P.S. I've not tried this yet, just giving examples for those who are curious. 
It's annoying that's for sure. Too many times I've been in arena and had someone dodge 4 turns in a row on low health and then kill someone on my team.

I just love Amerikkka's most wanted. Super amazing album. 
My advice to you is that while you're in school you work with a good therapist. There's a reason you've been using alcohol the way you have at such a young age. A good therapist can help you find out what that is and heal it so you don't have to use booze or food to feel better. Life can be really great. I was in your shoes when I was 18...except I was about to take a Navy ROTC scholarship.  I ended up turning it down and drinking a lot during college. I got sober a year after I graduated and 12 years later I have an amazing life. Therapy was/is indispensable. Changed my life! Hang in there!

Sure, but those things don't have nearly the scale that Burning Man does - the stuff that is created out there and possible solely because it happens on a flat hard surface is pretty amazing. Being out on the playa in a city created for a week of fun that you know is going to disappear is a different thing than camping in the woods with a couple thousand muddy people.

Ugh, I Fucking had it out with some stupid American kid in TeamSpeak.   I was born in Africa, and was talking about it, and he tried to correct me every time I said 'black'. He would cut me off and say "you mean African American", and I would say no, I meant black.  He could not wrap his thick little skull around the fact that Africans that had never been to America were just called Africans.   I'm pretty laid back, and takes a lot for me to snap, but I lost it on him, lol.

Years ago I attended a few Toastmasters just to be in the audience. The speakers are usually interesting and the critiques are gentle and constructive. The critiques pointed out the uhs and ums, so as the speakers get more and more aware of them, they get better. You have to practice not using them.   Of course now, I find it painful to listen to a speaker who is full of uhs and ums. 
are you sure that the rx480 is compatible and fits the case and mobo with the components? my brother is worried.

if I recall correctly, he deliberately made the dishes worth less than the ingredients used, because he didn't want people to feel obligated to cook in order to maximize profit.

I am an atheist but thought the Passion of the Christ was very well done, I wish more historical dramas would have the courage to shoot in Latin/Aramaic.  One criticism though, they really undersold the "why have you forsaken me father" bit, copped out by making Jesus too perfect when that part of the story is about his doubt.

&gt;I don't agree with describing us as under siege due to freedom of movement.   I think it's the perception of being under siege that matters   &gt;I agree with his points about the rigid nature of the treaty. Though somehow feel he might be more keen on it if it was 400 years old, based on how I've seen him speak on other matters, though this may be unfair. It's similar to how the American constitution often seems too rigid to me though of course there are mechanisms to change it somewhat.   I don't think Scruton is a particular fan of written constitutions; they're too top down.  &gt;I think he brushes off the economic arguments too easily. It might be fine for someone in a position of relative wealth and privilege but it may quite reasonably be the most important thing for some who struggle to get by each week or may not be able to find work in the future. And of course the standard line of economists always disagree with each other lol so don't listen too them is a cheap and lazy shot, especially with the general consensus the profession had on brexit.   Yet those who were likely to suffer most also tended to vote to leave. These people aren't stupid; they know that a world outside the EU will not be one of milk and honey, at least not on the short term, and yet they still voted to leave.  I just watched David Starkey on the Daily Politics say it best: (to paraphrase) 'the referendum was a culture war.'  And the right have won.

Yeah we still need to wait for polls with green party's Jill Stein in them because alot of Berniebots will go to her, polls look dirty anyways with dem oversampling.   Trump should still win these states but they are too close for comfort right now, alot of conservatives are still hoping Trump gets replaced at the convention, especially the Cruz crowd who are the loudest to bash Trump about being a liberal. That's why Trump needs a staunch conservative as his VP to quiet that crowd and put them at ease. Sessions is the guy Cruz always kisses up to because Sessions is the leading conservative voice on immigration, https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/why-does-ted-cruz-keep-name-dropping-jeff-sessions/2016/01/29/b6c7d122-c6d0-11e5-b933-31c93021392a_video.html Sessions is the real deal and the only true fighter for immigration and trade in congress. He is what Cruz pretends to be. Sessions as VP obliterates the #NeverTrump movement.

You need *grave reason* - because the primary purpose of Marriage is *children* and denying that is dangerous and sinful.  Birth control is trying to take onto ourselves something that God has reserved to Himself; the creation of the soul at the moment of conception is *God and God's alone* and we should tremble to dare to go against His will, or fear that he would give us a burden too great to bear.
They are also plenty of actors of Asian descent who are native English speakers and I'm sure they'd love some work. Why not just make everyone Japanese and have it take place in Tokyo?
Apple Music allows you to upload any personal music you have to the cloud, and access it from the app. There is no size limit. It tries to match the songs with music already available in Apple Music, and otherwise just uploads them so they work just like Apple Music tracks do. iCloud storage is for files and photos, it works a good bit differently.

Uh, there's a bar that I like to use for first dates. It has a good beer selection, decent food if either of us gets hungry and the bartender always knocks a beer or two off my tab.

No problem! Let me know how it goes. I am sticking to 90 for aim assist right now I have played with it for an hour or so and feel I am winning more of my battles.  Maybe it is just me about the whole stickyness of the aim assist. I do play a lot of Rainbow Six Siege and that game has NO aim assist whatsoever.  R6 taught me to always go for headshots so in Overwatch I found it hard to aim for the head because the aim assist is a bit too intense that I can't adjust my aim for moving targets and for headshots. 
That is a fantastic way of going about it. I feel like I don't absorb things unless I actively think about them and write them down...tactile learner and what not. When I'm reading these fantastic books I get inspired by them and see all these cool things I could do but instantly forget them when I sit down to write. 
Yep. Watchmen.

I wasn't picking on you I was picking on NBC for not including that info in their article.  The media likes to claim everything is terrorists or ISIS. Look at Turkey for instance, the media keeps swearing it was ISIS but they never give up any evidence on why they think it was them. But apparently it has the "hallmarks" of something ISIS would do.... Whatever that means.

Dogs make great boating companions! There are even brightly colored life jacket harnesses that you can fit the dog with.

I have some shirts that retain smells after a while, where the armpit doesn't smell clean even after washing.  Ones I got from old navy seriously are the worse offenders, every time.  Synthetic blends don't breathe as well as natural fibers, and some deodorants really stick to the fabric.  A good way to get that smell out of your shirts is to throw some white vinegar in the wash.  If they're really stubborn, add some white vinegar to a soak cycle/let it soak for a while.

FaZe *was* a top EU team before their roster changes, they definitely aren't anymore. They have yet to prove themselves as the team they once were, you listing their achievements from their past roster means nill.

I'm not trying to take sides here, but just as a note I often do this with Twitch's F2. If I know which room someone's in, I'll just unload a clip into the wall at some spot and hope that they run into my bullets. Where he aimed was a good spot too, since the bullets would have gone all the way through the room and out the door into the model room, catching anyone in between.

If you can, DO NOT come to Disney World in the summer. If it's just you, the spouse and a child under about age 4, stay the fuck home until they're 6 or so, and come at Christmas or Spring break.

I think jumping from such a budget PC to nearly top of the line is a bit silly. Something in between does the job for like 99% of gamers.  For maximum gaming effect for the price, bump it up to an i5-4460/4590/4690, stick with the RAM as-is, get a new PSU, maybe an SSD, and get a nice value card like a GTX 970 or RX 480.  Plenty of power for 1080p gaming.

If Jon is ice and Dany is fire and both of them are Azor Ahai candidates then Jon shows us what a good/heroic Azor Ahai looks like and Dany shows us what a villainous/evil Azor Ahai looks like.  If you've ever played Fable then the concept is similar. You're destined to eliminate a world threatening threat regardless of whether you're good (and want to save the known world) or evil (and only save the world to conquer it later as a tyrant).
I think he just said on a radio show that Christie isn't a top choice.
Romanza (is it by Paganini?) works pretty easy on the girls' bedroom eyes and a its no-brainer to learn. Loads of youtube tutorials on that one.

?? It says it's releasing September... Why would the PC version still be in development? If they haven't gone gold yet, they have another month to do so, and I hope they haven't because I don't like what i see so far. The lighting needs work.
I think the OP in that thread mentioned it was a business expense since he uses it to run VMs for his security position.

&gt;Well, if things are manufactured in China for low wages, with no environmental laws and no labor protection...perhaps that is bad for the world?  Nope. Low wages + low operating costs for the company means lower production costs which is why the price of technology is so cheap. And then you ask the Chinese worker who doesn't have to beg for money or barely survive in farm villages anymore, who can afford to send their children to college, and of course who are now forming the bulk of a new middle class in China, whether their lives have improved, and they will say yes. Because Chinese people (or for that matter, people in general) aren't so dumb that they work in crappy conditions for no reason and us Western Whites have to save them. They have plans and take actions to achieve those goals. So yes, that was good for the world.  &gt;That the main beneficiaries have been corporate bottom lines, and a culture of cheap, disposable consumerism?  I agree with half, that corporations are becoming too rich and powerful, and would support tax policies that target the richest people in the US (corporate tax rate here is too high compared to the rest of the world) who own those corporations. I don't think we have a culture of cheap, disposable consumerism, and generally allow people to buy what they want to buy without passing judgment. The fact that people can buy things for less money is a good thing imo.  &gt;I commented on your powers of discernment, based on the words you wrote. Saying that voters for both Brexit and Trump are simply poorly informed is sloppy, arrogant, and topically ignorant to boot - likely, you are not aware of what exactly is motivating them  I guess that's why I doubted your integrity, since you seemed to be calling me uninformed for no reason.  But yes, if you supported Brexit or Trump you are actually poorly informed. For the Brexit, all smart analysis suggests that leaving Brexit would spell at least a recession for Britain's economy, especially this idea that you can continue trading within the EU without having to meet conditions such as accepting free migration or adhering to EU regulations. Trump has few policy proposals, and is constantly lying or recanting those few policies (his most consistent policies have been the Muslim ban ("a total and complete shutdown on Muslims coming to the US") that he has now been stepping away from). I can understand why angry people upset with political correctness, as well as racists (although not all supporters are racist) would vote for him, but they are voting based on emotions and not logic.  &gt;You, however, have nothing by which to base your assumption about my honesty or integrity; you simply made it up from your own prejudices  I was basing this assumption because you seemed to be calling me uninformed for no reason. But whatever, let's leave ad hominems out since they're pretty much retarded.

You probably will see significant improvements with bloating. It's much harder to eat a lot of salty/fatty foods on a vegan diet. I don't think I've eaten a meal and hated myself after since going vegan. I've been full, but not in a painful bloated way.

Assuming one has 4 or 5 science consoles losing a small damage boost is absolutely ok when you get a good cooldown reduction and an increased firing cycle haste.   It is the same as using +Beam when you only have &lt; 3 tac consoles, absolutely ok when you see the advantage of the terran beam with AP weaponry in comparison to full AP.   Results on my nicor before skill revamp were an average of 78k when with 5 tac consoles and an average of 82k when with 4 tac and 1 timeline.   It is the same as with current top sci scimi builds: 5 plasma consoles, 2 flagship + timeline, leech, maybe bioneural lobi console and the last one or two are +Beam consoles for disruptor weapons and a herald AP array, with M6 computer upcoming its likely to happen that this one will be better than a tactical console.
Yeah, been there, done that.

I went to the park on my 1st day of not smoking.  A grandma was sitting at a picnic table under the shelter by the playground, just shouting at her tiny grandson to "climb the ladder!" while she smoked.  It broke my heart that she did not have the energy to be close to him while he played.  So glad that you are trying not to be that person!!!!

No, there are two types of posts you can submit to reddit, links and self/text posts.  A link post is one such as this one here where you have linked to an image. Other examples would be posts that link to a news article, video, etc.   A self/text post is one that does not link to anything and only contains text such as posts in /r/askreddit.  The double delete doesn't appear for link posts, only self/text posts.

Par 3s are hard.  Only a handful of tour player average under 3.  That's actually true of par 4s as well though.  Only on par 5s to tour guys always average under par. [only 10 guys average under 3](http://www.pgatour.com/stats/stat.142.html)  I was the same way; placed way to much pressure on myself to do well on par 3s since iron striking is my strength.  Once I found out even tour guys don't blitz par 3s I was able to back off mentally and do much better.

Late game you would be using electric furnaces, they don't require fuel. But even if you stuck with steel furnaces in the late game (you don't want to do this because you want to utilize the productivity modules in the electric ones whereas you can't use them in steel furnaces) one belt would be sufficient, the ratio of coal to ore is really high in favor of ore.

Rebel says he has 1000 pages of transactions. That's 20,000 completed orders. To flag 43 is laughable. That's damn near .2% if I'm not mistaken. Case closed. Now that's what I call egregious. It's highly likely there was a glitch but at the rate some of us are moving cards you're not even going to notice the added stubs because you're always lowering and upping them. Those 43 better be all in a row because spread out through 20,000 you're not going to notice

Well, they claim that, because the resultant children are multiracial, that the trend of interracial marriage will eventually lead to "pure whites" fading from existence, and in their eyes that somehow counts as a genocide. They often cite the UN definition of genocide which includes "imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group".  The problem with this is that there's no evidence of some shadowy group intentionally pairing whites and non-whites together for this purpose. All the evidence so far points to...and this is shocking...that those who are intermarrying *actually love and care for each other*.  Scary, huh?  PS: Even if mass intermarriage did lead to the eventual disappearance of whites as an ethnic group, wouldn't it also lead to the disappearance of *every other ethnic group* as well? In the end, there'd be no race but one, and therefore racism would end. Wouldn't be a *good* thing?

On a whim, I started using the P06 yesterday and was absolutely destroying people.  I remember using it before (all snipers really) and struggling to find myself in enough engagements to earn XP at a decent rate, but I was cranking out 40+ kill games with that and the MR6 like crazy.  I'm actually excited for when it's time to move to the Tempest to get the calling card for all these reasons!
nah
If only your anecdote represented the norm.  The vast majority of people spouting off the "GG EZ", or general shit talking or name calling every other sentence are often purposefully trolling for reactions BECAUSE they know it works.  Responding in any way other than blocking them usually only intensifies the trolling.  Prevent OW from being toxic?  HA!  It was already toxic well before release, and it will only get worse as days pass and people become fed up and leave.  The toxic element of our community is destined to condense and increasingly consume the time and patience of what shrinkingly remains.  This game is doomed to meet the same fate as all others before it, it is but a matter of time.
Me hizo acordar a una profesora que tuve hace unos años. Un día llevo la notebook para conectar al proyector para ver una cosa. De fondo de pantalla tenia una foto de Nestor y Cristina abrazados y decía bien en grande "EL AMOR VENCE AL ODIO."   Todos en la clase nos miramos instantáneamente con una cara de _cringe_ terrible.

The problem with alignments is people get caught up in what they "think" the alignment is supposed to be.  Lawful good is Lawful stupid, etc.  I've played evil characters in groups very successfully.  The trick is you don't use the alignment to be stupid and disguise it as alignment roleplay.  Parties can work together for the same goal without having the same alignment.  My favorite way to describe this is the princess trapped in the evil wizard's tower.  The lawful good paladin goes to save her because that is the right and just thing to do, and the wizard is evil and breaking the laws of the land.  The evil rogue goes to rescue the princess because he thinks he will get a reward for his action.  He doesn't care about the princess at all, he just wants the fat sack of gold or the increased access to marks he might gain by befriending the princess and her family.  It's against the interest of evil characters to go all psycotic murder hobo.  They will gain the unwanted attention of guards.  They will be put in prison or killed.  They will be blacklisted.  They will have bounties on their head.  It's in their interest to stay off this hit list and instead live and prosper.

Uh. That *isn't* true. At all.  Burning Man has *always* been a leave no trace event. It's the largest in the world. Hundreds (or thousands?) of volunteers stay after to make sure the area is spotless every year.  The government is involved because it's government land so they can charge for holding an event there. The ticket is paying for permit fees / the police the state makes them hire as part of the permit, etc.  Don't spread misinformation.

Yeah, if you can't see a Semi driving perpendicular to you in the middle of the day, you really shouldn't be driving.  I think this is an unfortunate case of the autopilot failing and the driver not paying attention.   Because it was the white trailer that was not seen by the autopilot, it seems like the truck was at least half way through the turn, meaning the driver really should have had enough time to hit the breaks.   Sounds like the driver was a very intelligent guy, but we all make stupid mistakes from time to time. He made one here and unfortunately paid the ultimate price for it.

So I looked into it.  [This watchdog article provides a more in-depth analysis](http://watchdog.org/199387/new-jersey-expensive-roads/) and also reiterates the 2m/centerline mile.  If you review the [linked report](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/) it makes no mention to NJ Transit, so why NJDOT reports NJ Transit supplements is beyond me.  Further, [DOT Commissioner Fox](http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/02/report_claiming_nj_roads_cost_2_million_per_mile_t.html) stated that NJ has 3.6x the number of line miles vs centerline.  So let's assume for a second that the national average is 2 lane miles per centerline.  The 200k/mile doesn't begin to pass a basic apples to apples comparison.  The RU report cannot possibly be based on the nationally reported data, and probably has convenient carve outs.  Other states seem to pay local road supplements, so Transit is the only X Factor that doesn't actually tie to the roads themselves.  I'd have to [presume that the report is only including the nominal $33 million state supplment and not the entire NJT budget](https://www.njtransit.com/pdf/FactsAtaGlance.pdf) because the 2012 ["Total Disbursements"](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/hf2.cfm) was 7.2B and Transit has a 2B budget.  If you look closely at the chart, everything is 'roads' and not railroads.  I know I'm looking in some places at 2012 and some at 2014 and 2015, but let's concede that our overall expenditures can't be so far off between years that they make that much of a difference.  Edit: 212k per lane-mile puts us at 763k/mile if they have 3.6x lane miles vs centerline, with some fuzziness for on/off ramps so it could be as high as 1m/centerline line depending on the total 'non road' distances one counts, like the mile long ramp that takes you from I95 to the GWB, etc.  That's cost isn't out of hand, it is closer to in line with MA, NY and CT.  However, the other 1-1.25m/mile is probably a 'maintain' vs 'construct and maintain' definition. That kind of constraint on definition is typically how government career people make things sound less bad than they really are to their political leaders and the public.

Indeed.  People looked down on that sort of thing, but it's not like today, where any conviction like that might as well be a death sentence.  It was a different time, with different attitudes.  The ease of background checks, the ease of gathering information, the offender registries and the fact that the fear mean those days are long gone.

The Japanese in Brazil, the Chinese in Africa, the Koreans in Central Asia (Stalin moved lots of them from Russian Far East to there so there is already a base set up) etc do know their old lands will be doomed sooner or later, and are securing their lebensraum.   There are quite a lot of out-of-reach, both physically and literally, places where the elites can flee, although I am a bit skeptical whether they can re-create civilization from there.

Then either you need to sync it to your phone or you need to check the box that says "manually manage music" under your phone in iTunes.

You can only sync to one library at a time.

It's not that doctors won't write for anyone, they just only write for people who cannot be treated with other avenues.  They would prefer people do a more holistic approach or even some PT, Stim, etc.   My PM doctor refuses to write for anyone that comes in with a back injury.  He just thinks they are too easy to fake and would rather not get into a situation where he's writing for someone that shouldn't be a pain patient.

Bah, you're right, BUT... and this is a big butt... you forgot to account for the ballistic coefficient (BC) of the pellets, the weight of the pellet, the Coriolis effect, and energy behind each pellet. Estimating a range of ~356 yards (you can estimate this from the way it is), and accounting for weight, BC, energy, wind resistance, the Coriolis effect, and curvature of the Earth you can quite obviously see that the total number of pellets fired becomes a function of the Schrödinger equation. Thus we see that both 1,439,318,655.824 pellets, and 33,072,986 pellets contacted him at the same time, and at no time, resulting in a calculated 6.023x10^23 pellets.

I would consider the issue is that they're on Vista-era hardware.  Vista only came with computers from around 2007 to 2009 - which would mean the hardware is between 7 and 9 years old. Laptops have a life of around 3-5 years, and desktops generally up to 7 years, but past this you're too far outside the curve to be considered for most applications.  RuneScape was designed to play on these computers funny enough, but it can't run 'well'.
I'd never say no to more beer - even if it wasn't drunk that night, it'd be nice that the new person thought to bring some. Cans are usually preferred.  If you get yelled at, don't take it too personally. They might be trying to yell over the wind, or warn you off doing something dangerous for the boat or yourself. This goes double if you're racing - the skipper might need something done ***now***. Hopefully you don't have a Captain Bligh style skipper though!  Turn up ahead of time, and be the first one to offer a hand to get the boat ready. Equally though, if the skipper says they need you to just sit while they do some things, do that (it can be exhausting trying to explain things/find things a new person can do sometimes).

Yeah, been there a number of times. It only got worse and worse to the point of panic attacks, fear and cry each time I noticed they've grown again :(  Seriously, the worse to feel like you might be outsized of bras and only a couple of houses in some country in the world are the last options, and even then the bras are prone to hurt you through the day for the sake of high tits :(

It wasn't generic in 1992. Armin is educating you
&gt; a room full of you, this time you all have a gun. you hear a gunshots. you all take out your gun and start shooting the person with the gun.  See? You said it yourself, if we all have guns then we subdue the shooter.  &gt; 50 people with no gun and a shooter. if they are like you, they just die. if they are like me then only some of them die and there's 1 or more heroes  Your plan involves many of the 50 people dying in the process of taking down the shooter. Why would you risk so many lives when there would be much less risk in everyone having a gun?  &gt; if they are like you, they just die.  No they don't, because if they are like me then they would all have guns and there would be little to no casualties, unlike your plan that involves mass death because no one has a gun except the shooter. It's obvious that all people having guns turns out much better than only the shooter having a gun.

I'm wondering if you could enlighten us a little bit as to why you think this?  I'm by no means a Benning apologist, but I can at least see that he is doing what he can with the parameters and the assets that he is given. Some of his contracts are... not ideal, much like some trades that he has executed, but after what happened yesterday I think things are looking even better on Benning.   If it takes one of the best young left wingers in the league (the best?) to get a young middle-pair dman then I actually think Benning is a rocket scientist for sending McCann (a kid who is best served in the AHL next year and only shows promise to be an under-sized second line centre) with a 2nd to Florida for Gudbranson. It's becoming obvious that defence is becoming a huge value in the NHL.  Also, a lot of what he's done was essentially clean up after the Aquilinis refused to let the team embrace a rebuild a year or two sooner.

At least GB is man enough to show his face and the fact that he actually does shit outside of Reddit. I would eat my sock if /u/dick-nipples actually held a full-time job which requires his undivided attention for 40 hours a week. Otherwise his life consists of continuously checking the top posts of the hour so he can get to be the first to get in a witty comment.
Confirmation bias.
People are bitching about how Wenger will get blamed because of some fake ITK's rumours, but Wenger doesn't get the blame for signing players we were never in for, he gets the blame because he doesn't sign ANYBODY. There's no excuse to not sign anyone in positions you need to reinforce. "There was no-one available" is the biggest load of bullshit as well.

His station was UA Bombed prior to his jump. People learned that if you sell a large number of Unknown Artefacts in the commodities market of a station it causes "damage" to the station. The effect is that the mission board and other things can get shut down until repaired. This happened to Jaques Station before it jumped.  &amp;nbsp;  The way to "cure" a UA bomb lockdown is to sell Meta-Alloys at the station that was bombed. Ostensibly the station market uses the Meta-Alloys to counter act the damage caused by the Unknown Artefacts.   &amp;nbsp;  Once players cure the station and stop the plague, Jaques station will come out of lockdown and we'll get the mission board, repair, refuel, Universal Cartographics, etc back, making it a viable outpost for exploration.

Yeah, that's definitely a possibility. If that's the case, then there's nothing to worry about from the league's perspective. If there isn't something formally put in place, then I think we could see some teams follow suit because who cares about a warning if there's no way for the rest of the league to stop them without altering the rules?

I don't know about other countries, but at least in the USA it's impossible for a mainstream (i.e. democrat/republican) politician to get *anywhere* without taking in massive donations from various individuals and organizations (some noble, many less so). Corruption isn't just money envelopes switching hands under tables.   Part of the reason why the system is perceived as corrupt is that politicians argue (bicker?) over surface-level issues, but both sides of the political spectrum seem to be content with the status quo when it comes to bigger questions. Things like foreign policy, militarism, trade deals, economic inequality, war on drugs, militarization of the police force, mass surveillance, etc.

&gt;Come on, you can't be that stupid.  **Ad Hominem.... again...**&gt;   &gt;John Cook is not the source, he links to peer-reviewed sources from actual climate scientists. Also, the link I provided was to Tamino's blog. Tamino is an actual climate scientist.  **I will repeat this again, when I link to Tisdale's peer reviewed sources, you will take this back?**  Baaaahahaha.. Ok I'm better now...  &gt; Tisdale is the actual source on that blog, and he's not credible.  **Jesus on a bicycle, do you want an example of Cook doing this? Honestly I don't know why I ask, we all know the answer..psst "it's cognitive dissonance"** &gt; I don't care where the science is hosted, if the person maintaining the site is a cartoonist or an accountant - what matters is that the source itself is scientifically legitimate. Tisdale isn't.  **You sure seem to care a whole lot what label the person has when you do not agree with them, but when they agree with your Cast-In-Stone unchanging dogma, then well let's move the goalposts shall we...**   &gt;So if I show Tisdale links to "actual research" are you going to take that back?  &gt;His interpretation of the research and how he tortures legitimate data is the problem. Of course, I don't expect a quasi-religious fanatic like you to be able to understand the difference.  **Never met a altered dataset ya didn't love have ya? (As long as it supports your predetermined world view..)**  &gt; I am honest, and knowledgeable. You, on the other hand, are maybe one of the two.  **Another Ad Hominem, I also like how you pay homage to yourself in that one too, nice 1-2 punch**

They make money. Simple as.  Jump scares are the "pie in the face" of horror movies. People with no taste, and who just want to watch mindless slop, pay a lot of money to be entertained. Jump scares cater to a very broad audience. The audience that listens to pop music and spends $400 on Air Jordans.

So 75% of the things you buy will now be more expensive? What's that going to do to your bank account or how much you can put into savings each month?   We have the 3rd or 4th highest tax rates in the world. That's a big reason why these companies leave? Shouldn't we fix that instead of imposing more taxes?   Do some research into our country's history of passing similar tariffs. Almost every one has sent the nation into a recession or depression.

Yes, hence why the title says (UC) in it. I used the Ultimate Cut when it was accidentally released on Cineplex a week before the official release.

Ok.
Black market marijuana would get less expensive because they have more competitors, and ones that are guaranteed to keep both the buyer and seller out of legal trouble. There is a direct economic trade-off when breaking the law (buying/selling illegal goods) in this case and if other similar industry behaviours hold for a marijuana market, then most people would pay the difference between illegal and legal prices in cash, rather than criminal risk.

I don't understand the hype. Is there any?
My original response was gonna be maybe you just aren't hostile enough.  But then I watched your d pick vid - which I glanced over but didn't click a few minutes ago. Gz on pick!  Anyway, I think that 10 minute video is what got you dislikes/no feedback. If you had posted a picture, I bet you'd have gotten better results. If it's going to be video you should probably make it a short(er) clip, or point out what time the important part of the video happens. *Edit: I didn't watch the rest of your video, since I assumed the d pick was the only worthwhile/mentionable thing because of your title. Maybe you should've named it (your reddit post) something else if your intention was to show more than you getting a d pick.  You baited me by saying "comments appreciated". What do you expect beyond "gz on pick"? Did you expect me to watch the whole 10min vid? Easier to click dislike after waiting nearly 2 minutes into your video to see you actually get the d pick (and react like it was a pet drop) and then be faced with another 8 mins left on your video.  *Edit2: I didn't dislike your video or downvote your reddit post, but if I was going to those are the reasons I would.

Well, different folks have different experiences with these things. Just 'cause it didn't happen to you isn't definitive proof that it didn't happen to anyone.

This comes down to evolution, more or less.  We tend to think of domestication as something we do to animals, but the traits that make an animals domesticate-able are randomly evolved.  They become extraordinarily advantageous (in the evolutionary sense) for a species because it ensures that said species continued existence is protected and ensured by humans (many species will tell you that its not so good to be on the bad side of humans...).  As for our ability to willfully domesticate animals, the answer is complicated. Time is the factor.  The entire topic of "breeding" is that of selecting out traits.  The famed russian fox experiment took 50 years to get wild foxes to the point of being friendly house pets.  Thats way longer than a typical domestication effort would support so most animals have become domesticated through random selection, rather than breeding.  We clearly _can_ domesticate animals willfully, but how often are we going to spend 50 years to do so?  (and it'd be a lot longer with animals that breed less frequently!)

This is actually a really old Judo/JuJitsu technique called Katate Hazushi Ichi.  It does work, but its used as a wrist escape.  It's definitely more effective than "chi/ki" powers.

En donde yo estaba también...  y me llamó la atención, que ya estuviera eso tan avanzado, cuando a las diez y media estábamos ahí (y la que se iba al juzgado con el sobre, saldría sobre las once menos cuarto...).  En mi colegio  (Alicante) no hubo interventores,ni nadie a la hora de constituir la mesa, sólo unos apoderados que aparecerían después a ratos y al final para recoger el acta (El de PP sólo vino al mediodía a presentarse y no apareció más, por lo que no se llevó acta alguna, y la del Psoe sólo se llevó la de una, por que tenía 'prisa' y no quería quedarse "hasta las tantas", después de haber intentado 'liarla' al mediodía..). El de podemos si se llevó (por cierto, muy agradable y atento con todos los que estaban en la mesa y no lo digo por que fuera PODEMOS...).  El administrador de la junta, fue muy majo también, pero cuando no cuadró la cuenta por un voto, y la presidenta de la mesa le preguntó que qué hacían (iban con prisas, por que alguno tenía que trabajar al día siguiente...), éste le respondió que se pusiera como voto en blanco y ya (algo que no me pareció correcto por su parte siendo el que venía por parte de la junta electoral...). A mí la verdad, el sistema me dió que pensar. Y sí, en mi mesa se vieron muchos votos al PP pero no más que Podemos, (en éste caso iba igualada la cosa... ), después el Psoe (que serían como la mitad de Podemos) y luego C's (en comparación con los anteriores pocos...). De los minoritarios, el Pacma es el que se llevó algo.

Whenever people ask about Super, I usually say that the first two arcs which are just rehashes of the movies can be skipped unless you are really into extra banter.

I'll have to disagree with that. I'm 34 and I watched Hockey Night in Canada every Saturday since I can remember. I was only 6 when The Trade happened, but I have *very* clear memories of him when he played for the Kings, later with the Blues and Rangers, and definitely when he retired...  not to mention various international tournaments, the Pro-Stars cartoon, and his general pop culture ubiquity.

You're not.  He's never done a direct copy ability outside maybe somewhat 72 transformations.  Generally he does things similar to other things in the game but that is hardly a crime, Jing Wei is actually just the same thing as several other things in the game with slight twists. This guy just hates Fish for some reason and seems to have gone through the whole thread on a tirade against him.
So you're writing an ensemble piece, similar to a Robert Altman film.  The conflicts and what those conflicts expose in the four characters is your story.  At least, that is one useful way to look at storytelling.  Consider the Harry Potter books without Ron Weasley.  No one with arachnophobia. No one from a poor family.  No redhead.  No one with a crush on Hermione expressed as juvenile indifference.  
I was too young to remember  [Iran Air flight 655](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655) so I looked it up...  &gt;The incident took place in Iranian airspace, over Iran's territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, and on the flight's usual flight path. The aircraft, an Airbus A300 B2-203, was destroyed by SM-2MR surface-to-air missiles fired from Vincennes. All 290 people on board died.  &gt;According to the United States government, the crew incorrectly identified the Iranian Airbus A300 as an attacking F-14A Tomcat fighter  Just wow.

Hi, I'd like to give my opinion cause I'm a pretty newish player only level 22 who plays support seriously. When I first got the game and my boyfriend was teaching me there was huge thing he had against support eg:  -boring -don't get kills -actually have to input into the team to help achieve victory -etc  So basically I never new what support was and was told to go mid/top/bot (but stay away from jungle) and go nuts. I think there's a huge negative connotation attached to support so when someone cant get mid etc they go troll support cause they're mad they couldn't get the role they wanted. (but you probably knew all of this information anyways)  I'm not sure what can be done about it because I've had games where someone has called a role then all of a sudden goes a support role, and completely fucks the game intentionally. Why???? No one knows it's annoying.   Maybe you could make a new account and start all new and level up in adc that way? Cause lower level people are way nicer I reckon and if you say do this or whatever they're usually pretty chill. I'm not sure if this helps at all.
Also from North Carolina, we also can't merge for shit, generally.

The wave you describe exists, but the OP article is not part of it. Sortition is obviously not better than elections in every way, but a system of electing representatives, as we have seen in the past several years/decades, absolutely has certain vectors by which it can be exploited in anti-democratic ways. Sortition does not have these same exploit vectors, and the exploit vectors it does have are not present in systems of elected representation. The author of this article is not advocating for the wholesale elimination of referendums or elections, he's promoting the supplementation of these democratic practices with sortition. Just look at what he uses as an example of sortition working at its best in the real world: the Irish constitutional convention. In that case, a group of representatives chosen by sortition worked with a group of representatives chosen by election to draft a referendum. Was that somehow undemocratic? &gt;This is fucking hilarious, a., because it presupposes that a smaller number of people will somehow come to a better consensus than a large number of people (why?)  Because getting a smaller number of people to agree on something is easier than getting a larger number of people to agree on something, or even just discuss something cohesively.   &gt;And further, the argument rests on the same insulting presupposition that undergirds the whole "people can't be trusted to govern themselves" thing by saying that sortition works by giving this random, unelected group of citizens "a chance to learn from experts, listen to proposals, talk to each other and engage with politicians" in coming to their consensus.   I wholeheartedly disagree that sortition presupposes any such thing. Giving ordinary citizens direct access to elected representatives, not just through phone calls and letters/emails that will only ever be glanced at by some overworked intern, seems to very rightly be placing much more trust in people than our current system. Giving those ordinary citizens a voice in actually creating policy instead of a simple boolean yes/no reaction to the policy or the representative's reaction to the policy is giving ordinary citizens a greater deal of trust than in our current system.   &gt;Do you honestly think that the plebiscite doesn't do this just because they sometimes come to a consensus that you don't agree with, or that may be harmful?   I think that people have busy lives and don't have time to make themselves well informed on every issue. I think that commercial media promotes sensationalism and soundbites because it's profitable, and that exacerbates the issue, especially when wealthy interests deliberately exploit this to mislead people. I think that also giving randomly selected people the obligation and opportunity to hash things out, in person and over a prolonged period, with other randomly selected people with different viewpoints about how given policy will actually affect them in their real lives will lead to better decisions than *only* having politicians paying lip service to win points with their base as they posture about legislation that will never affect them to other politicians who aren't listening but are only waiting for their turn to do the same. I think that elected representatives are subject to some very anti-democratic pressures that randomly chosen people would not be subject to. I think I'd be willing to trust randomly selected people in such an environment to represent me more than I trust establishment, career politicians.  &gt;Disregarding the idea that sortition is basically representative democracy without that pesky elected legislature, I don't see how you can call restricting aspects of the legislative process to small, unelected but somehow "representative" samples is anything but undemocratic.  Who's calling for replacing all elections with sortition?  &gt;Who selects the sortition samples?  Who selects who gets jury duty letters?  &gt;Of whom are they representative?  That'd depend on what they were selected for.  &gt;Why, in the name of God, would a group of 66 randos come to a better, more informed decision than 66 million?  Because those 66 "randos" as you so derogatorily refer to them (you seem to have a lot of respect for "voters" as a single entity, but almost none for any individual voter that would be included in sortition) would be given the time and resources to do so, as well as in person, regular access to the people  representing entirely different demographics/view points (both elected and chosen through sortition), which is not something that can be provided for 66 million on every issue. And that's not even starting on the issue of how you expect 66 million people to cohesively and democratically draft what's being voted on in the first place.  &gt;It's amputating your arm because you've got eczema.  Or, if, as the article actually suggests, you supplement existing democratic practices with sortition where it makes sense to do so, it's like taking medicine for your eczema instead of insisting that it would just go away on its own if only you keep doing the same thing you've been doing which is also somehow how you got eczema in the first place.  When you do everything through elections and referendums you're limiting constituents input to the political process to only two things: "yes" or "no". Sortition drastically expands upon the level of input that ordinary citizens have in the process.

Now let me ask you, Ms. All That, what would you like to do?! SONG OR NO SONG?!?!
&gt; FDR was secretly a communist. Before he became president, he was part of a red plot to crash the U.S. stock market, consequently leading to a nationwide economic depression. When he became president in 1932, he put forth a series of legislation which would be a stepping stone toward turning the country into a communist state, I.e., social security. Republicans in Congress were so appalled by what FDR was doing, as well as the fact that Americans approved, that they engineered a Nazi plot to burn down the German parliament building and blame it on communists, thereby leading to anti-communist and right-wing maniac Adolf Hitler being given full dictatorial powers. They then encouraged Hitler to make aggressive moves in Europe, forcing FDR to halt his communist chess moves and focus on the impending world war. When it was obvious that the war was coming to an end in 1945, FDR was assassinated by the same Republicans, who made his death look like natural causes. Also Obama's a terrorist.  Better?

A professor of mine who studied in Quebec used 'donc' as a filler. She said it was common there. 
Not necessarily automation, even human-controlled mechanisation can be a big help. Where I lived 20 years ago, garbage collection was done by a gang of several men hanging on the back of a lorry jumping off to manually lift metal or plastic bins into the back of the truck. Where I am now it is one man who never leaves his cab: he just pulls up, pushes a button and an arm reaches out and empties the bin. That has apparently caused wage to stagnate for the remaining dustmen, because what was once an unpleasant (and even dangerous) manual job is now a comfortable one which anyone with the right class of driving license can do. It has also saved on fuel and maintenance by speeding up the rounds.

Please for the love of God do not buy from cyberpowerpc. You're overpaying by several thousand dollars. I'd build the damn thing for $100 if I was nearby. I guarantee most Reddit users here would do a skype session with you and help with the build.   This is a case of more money not really equalling more performance. Most of what your cost is comprised of is either the cyberpowerpc markup, or stuff that won't equal more than a few percent real world performance and certainly don't make your PC last 10 years with no upgrades. Custom liquid cooling is also a massive pain in the ass, and only for people that over clock or do it for fun. No amount of money is going to get a PC that will run all future AAA games without compromising the fidelity or performance. Today's top of the line 10 year old hardware won't even meet the minimum for most new titles. My recommendation, spend 3k on a PC every 4 years. After 3k, you really don't see much real world performance gain in gaming. There are some good suggestions around here. I highly recommend taking them.

Not necessarily. Let your reader's imagination do some of the work. Or even most of the work. 
He is so fucking boring.
1. Although they are legendary, that doesn't necessarily mean that they need to have such amount of restrictions on obtaining them. A game where one of the main themes is collecting cards and leveling them up shouldn't be based on making them near unobtainable to the common player. Look at Hearthstone, which is a good comparison for a collecting card game, where the legendary cards are hard to get, but are realistically obtained through paying and dusting (selling) your cards you don't want or use, and getting the new one. SC puts unrealistic standards on how to get them, and essentially make them top tier play restricted and leveling.   2. Can't really respond to this, no basis.  3. Despite it being a meta, it's awfully poor at best. The fact that on the official CR forums there is a tab specifically for card balances for the community to suggest, and that tab is always active, means that it's not just what's meta and what isn't, but that balancing isn't done right. When this game gets thousands of games of data a day, and cards are consistently winning, losing, or controlling games, there should be real balance changes, and a lot more regularly than waiting a month. Also, balances should not be focused on focusing certain card vs card, but rather, an individual cards performance.  4. Tournament mode is a solution, but the game shouldn't have skill in many scenarios be overridden by card level. Essentially, unless you are perfect at the game, with unbelievable amounts of knowledge and intuition, the game constantly stops you by having players with better cards faced up against you.   5. Not a problem anymore, but an actual balanced gamemode where people play on equal grounds shouldn't take 3 months to come along. Maybe it is impatience here, but a true skill vs skill mode is overdue.  6. Agreed, but similar in similar context to my previous point.  7. A problem that has yet to be recognized, let alone brought up, discussed, or fixed by SC as well.  8. ^  9. True, and I won't argue against that. This was a bit more personal opinion after looking back at it, but it's poor nonetheless. Changes could be made, but the prices are unjustified the higher you go. Unless you are getting epics, it's usually better to just request every time.  10. If you look at the reddit post that linked the post on the forums, you can see that it is overwhelmingly hated, and unjustified. The option to mute would satisfy many players, while at the same time, emote users can still use theirs, but they just won't be seen.  11. 2 months for a card collecting game, with all of 54 cards to not have any additional cards is horrid. In a game setting like this, a lot of cards is healthy to keep the game fresh, a constant changing meta, and keep more cards in check with counters and combinations. Instead, with how few we have, there is an all to obvious power rating of cards, and a constant state of imbalance.  12. But is it good for a company to have it's players constantly hating it. Do you think the community will want to stay if they are ignored, and treated like cattle for money, rather than the players that give the game it's life, money, and additional players?  I would like to give a solid middle finger in your direction for this last comment. I make something based off of my view on the game in it's current state, and you make a comment that dumbs down to not worth reading, don't upvote. Why don't you offer another point of discussion rather than a half assed statement of disagreement.

Mate, Karakorum had a permanent population, that’s was precisely why I mention it. It was the center of an Empire, the place was full of Persian administrators and Mongol noblemen.  Before it “Mongol city” meant “bunch of yurts” (Avarga wasn't a real city), but here we have a description of a stone city with actual edifications but no permanent residents, this place can’t be like Karakorum.

The in-game model isn't as good as I remember, but looking at it now in Dolphin in 1440p, it's just different polygonal tiers of the same model. It's at the very least, not 'different styles', just polygon culling for performance, which is still even common with brand new games, so I don't know why Code Veronica would be singled out for it.
This is good news! I'm not against development, per se, but governments need to start acting responsibly in having meaningful conversations with First Nations and other Aboriginals, and also with their broader constituency.

I wasn't aware looking at facts was racist. How can people believe there are certain genetic differences between races, say, with Vietnamese males who average around 5'4 and Dutch at 6'2, and still believe that something so complex such as intelligence can't be partly hereditary. Sure you can say Dutch people are taller because of environmental and nutritional differences, but the difference is too significant to only include those factors. It wouldn't explain why Africans in impoverished countries are taller on average then Asian people. Why is height considered largely hereditary but intelligence can't be? Why is it racist to say black people score significantly worse on IQ tests then whites? Why are poor white kids on average less likely to go into prison then black people, why do poor white kids on average perform better then rich black kids on standardised tests? No one would accuse me of being a racist of saying Eastern Asians are smarter then whites on average, who are then outdone by Ashkenazi Jewish people, but when it's black people being scrutinised on statistics and evidence, then you're somehow a racist.

A giant is also counted as an error, because according to the box, it is a packet bigger than the configured MTU. I would start with checking to see if the Giants are being dropped, or if they are a red herring. Would hate to have you checking out the giants as a real error, if the packers really are not being dropped because of it. I know some IOS versions would count a 1504 byte packet (with VLAN tagging) as a giant but still happily forward it. (Cosmetic bug only). Only way to really know why the slowness is occurring is to fire up wire shark on one end or both and see where the drops (if any) are occurring.
Hey! We broke 200 LOB for the month!
They have talked about it before. It's not fake.
It happens a lot of casual before I realized it spelled minimum in the field lines.
I suck at this game, and I agree with you.
Basically something very similar to bicycle reflectors that would go in the spokes of your wheel. I need them to be a nice crystal clear and not something brittle that will be full of hairline cracks though. They're small enough that I think they could be done on a parts tree like model cars come, and you could probably fit several trees in a mold
I was hanging out in a global channel in Path of Exile and just learned that the manga is back on hiatus? I haven't read in a very long time and I wanna get caught up, the last chapter was before the hiatus, they were preparing for I think the Dark World, can someone tell me which chapter I should start off from? Thanks a bunch!

Yeah, Friday's even better, (for me lol), but I bet for Dave too, for the same partying factor. But maybe it conflicts with his shit. At least Thursdays.
Thank you. That's good to know!

I mean, why would you torture us
I don't know what it does. Nobody really knows the mechanism, just some of the effects. Hasn't been studied for long, and it takes a long while to reach scientific consensus.  I'm pretty sure fascia is not going to 'break up' from 'myofascial release' because if your fascia broke up from a soft thing being rolled against you, you have a severe medical condition. Or are dead, and decaying.  Got any clinical experience or research to back up your one anecdote? I don't, but I linked to a guy with relevant experience in both lifting and working with athletes through injuries, and application of foam rolling.
I think anyone young, hydrated, and active would be the sweet spot. But I think eating teenagers would considered one step too creepy.

So legit only fear I have is of leviathan type creatures. Including whales. So this part of the game will stress me.. especially if they get VR.

Mike Bibby, Big Z and Eddie House playing meaningful minutes.  What a weird team that was. 
That really depends on where you live in this country.
Like I said, it depends on how you define "rich."  If you're making $200K a year, you're driving a BMW or a Mercedes, not a Ferrari or Bugatti.  You don't own a private jet.  You probably own one home, maybe two.  You don't own four homes in four countries. Regardless of how much money you have in savings, you're dependent on your paycheck for your lifestyle.  That's not rich.  
Bahaha yes I do!

I love how jerma just taps his foot to the spinning t-pose spy
&gt; Take this groovy line for example which iterates over a list of numbers and prints all the numbers below 6  &gt; [1, 5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 7].findAll { it &lt; 6 }.each { println it }​  What if you want to stop when you get to your first "3"? There's no way to put in a break, so it's back to *foreach*. And why is another list being created, i.e. [1, 5, 3, 5], when all that's happening is it's being printed? And then why would you even use a list when only the array-like nature of the data is being used, i.e. traversal? Arrays are just as syntactically messy to represent in Groovy as in Java.  Better to use a language that's statically-compiled from the ground up (e.g. Java 8, Scala, Kotlin) with more dynamic stuff (e.g. list/map shortcut notation) added later, rather than a dynamic language with static-typing shunted (e.g. Groovy). The real problem with Groovy is it was initially designed by its creator (i.e. James Strachan) to be a dynamic *complement* to Java, but was repurposed by a later manager (i.e. Guillaume Laforge) to be a *competitor* to Java.
Give it to me, please?
I have a problem with the timers because they feels a tad too arbitrary. I would have enjoyed if they brought more reinforcements or something instead.
the nerf was due tho the fact that everyone was using the same meta...as i expect them to do with this tanktician. I believe once that is fix people will have no choice but to build around their weapon as the game was intended for them to do...so in other words bring on the nerfs....whats a loot base/mmo without em?

I guess not, the odds are only around +250 for Browne and -300 for Cain. I thought it would be higher (around +400), I just haven't heard any/many people say they were picking Browne to win. I wouldn't touch it at current odds, but still think Travis has a good chance.

Foreach is a function that walks through the array and, for each item in the array, it calls your function and gives it the item, position (index), and the original array just because it's useful.    Array.prototype.forEach = function (callback) {    var array = this;    for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++)  {     callback(array[i], i, array);    }  }   In this case, `callback` is your `Info` function. You hand off your function to foreach and it gets invoked with each item.   Does that help or is it even more confusing?

Yeah there is a fee, usually not much, just to cover equipment and maybe a little extra. in this case it was $25 for three days so I don't reckon they would have made much profit.

You're telling me a world in which the bringer of the end times, the massacre of every living thing on the known world and then its subsequent destruction, who is conceived via rape by a Norscan Marauder, is unsuccessfully aborted in an ocean due to the machinations of a demon named Be'Lakor, is finally born, killing his mother in the process, and goes on to basically become the most destructive force in a fantasy universe isn't grimdark?  As far as I know Warhammer Fantasy (up until Age of Sigmar) is one of the only fantasy settings in which the bad guy actually wins.
Fuck the meta
&gt;Another point to add to this is that the people you least want armed will definitely be the last ones to give up their guns  The people you least want armed are the people you don't even know have guns, because they are felons or mentally ill or otherwise not allowed to purchase them legitimately. Before you even got to those people, you'd run into a lot of people who legally and legitimately purchased their guns who would also be very reluctant to give them up.

I could really care less.   I just don't think such a large decision should have been: 1. put to direct democratic vote, 2. allowed without minimums set for number of voters and greater than majority percentage of votes.  And even accepting that that's what happened, I do think that this vote was too full of emotion and manipulation and elements of a perfect storm that the vote truly needed experienced and more informed voters, aware that "this isn't a game" situation.   And if you think it's just "tough titties" and that 49% is too little to care about, I don't know what to tell you.

Fry as many eggs as you did potatoes. Put them on top and some ketchup and mix it all up, yolk and all. Mmm. 
Whoa!  Well, this seems radical. None of the new code proposed is legal in current C++, which is good, but how easy would it be to change existing compilers to accept this?  Not sure.  ...  Well, after some thought, I like it.  I can definitely see the need, I can't see the downside (aside from "C++ is already huge" which is a legitimate argument of course).
I think it's the fact that there are better players at each position. Odor is doing great, but not better than Cano or Altuve. Beltre is having a great year but not better than Machado. Desmond is killing it, but there are a lot of great outfielders. Why Hamels didn't make it I'm not sure, maybe because he is new to the AL.
Well, you do realize that division wins don't equal division title right? A team could lose all 6 division games and not lose another one and as long as the other team is 9-7 the team that went 0-6 still wins the division. So that doesn't even really matter.   And yes, I do devalue wins against the Jags and Titans....when we do it to. Those *should* be easy wins.

I own the Vampire.   Are you sure those good stats are not remnants of a time when the Meteor and Vampire had a BR of 7.0?  Why do you not use aircraft performance to determine Battle Ratings anyway? Just looking at the Top speed and climbrate of the Meteor mk 3 compared to the Mig-17, it's a hideous mismatch.  Using your system right now, the only way for these two planes to have the Battle Rating changed would be for pilots to intentionally fly badly.   Might i suggest that when you have some free time (hard for a CEO I'm sure), you play some 8.0 british jets and see how much fun it is to face Mig 15's.

Not really. Sure they make great cars, but they have been deceiving in the last years. The Civic used to be a fun, dynamic car, and they made it into a grandpa's car. It looks like they've got their lesson, because the new Civic seems to target younger consumers, but we'll see.

Uhhh ok, I don't think you read the comment thread. He/she said:   **You still typically pay a dollar to buy a dollar of debt.**   You said:   **sometimes people even pay a PREMIUM for it.**   So even your comment is saying that the OP is wrong. They also say that they are a fixed income quant when any type of "quant" should know that you typically don't buy debt at a 1:1 ratio or else there would be no point in buying it.   Edit: Also could you tell me one situation where you would buy debt for more than it is worth or even for exactly what it is worth?

If only they also made a website that would receive these faxes from a computer and also display them on a computer. We could call it an e-letter or something. I'll work on that idea.
My guess is no. However it doesn't hurt to swing by and see if it fits!
I'd also like to point out that the context of the incident at the Laugh Factory was that this girl **heckled** him (something you absolutely never ever EVER should do at a show)   So he wasn't literally saying "it'd be funny if she got raped" he was saying "she's an awful person and I hope something bad happens to her. not to mention she's WRONG and any topic can be funny" Plus the absurdity of an unprovoked gang-rape is hilarious  And it was an off-handed, in-the-moment, comment that was frankly, kind of funny
These things happen a lot more frequently than we think.   When I was 15, I moved to middle-of-nowhere Georgia from a major city mid school year. I had to take a psychology class (later renamed "community studies" because the teacher wasn't qualified to teach it), where all we did was hangout and shoot the shit for about an hour a day. Basically a loose study hall. As the new student, my teacher thought it'd be appropriate to do an ice breaking exercise with me at the front of the class and let people ask me questions. Everyone was pretty chill. Until the teacher chimed in.  Teacher: "Since you happened to arrive during the week where we're exploring human sexuality, I'm curious as to what input you have personally. Are you a virgin?"  Quickly devolved into him allowing the male students to raise their hands and ask me questions about my favorite position, etc. etc. I stated that I was a virgin, and was heckled the rest of the semester.  As a kid, I felt trapped. I was new, in a bad place, and he was everyone's favorite. I didn't want to tell my parents, as they were already dealing with a lot at the time.  Thankfully he was later fired for drinking at a bonfire with underage students in the woods.
...How in the actual fuck? That's impressive, i'm impressed.
I'm so happy the Huffington Post still hasn't gotten back to journalism. Their go-nowhere puff pieces are much better now that they've turned on the Democrats. Too bad they lost legitimacy during this election cycle. I give the paper a few more years till it folds. 
Ok, gg.

Isn't he only shutting down access to the beach through his property, but not trying to claim he owns the beach, therefore people can still use the beach if they get to it (such as from other water-based access), even though that could be very difficult?
Thank you! I think that the Bagon is about 5 IV-ish, I'm not certain, since she was bred with a 6IV and a 5-6 IV parent duo, so I hope you enjoy the Dream Ball exchange!

I'd recommend it for an introduction, but you'll need to supplement it with some YouTube lectures to fully understand. His course on Coursera is extremely mathematically basic, which means he does basically none of the calculus and very little of the linear algebra. It can be hard to gain a mathematical intuition from his course.  On the other hand, if you don't know calculus or linear algebra, it's an excellent starting point, but you're really shooting yourself in the foot if you want to get serious with ML without the math. The general ideas and programming exercises are pretty decent.

If superfluous violence is something that bothers you, I'm amazed you've made it this far into Game of Thrones. I feel like this season might have been less violent than the previous, making this act stand out more, but in the context of the show as a whole, it hardly surprised me.

I hope so too!! I'm happy to hear you're trying it out-- you've got a smile plastered to my face haha. Good luck! :)
It can stand but it is false. You lie to yourself so it will not be anything new from you. There are classified tests and documents in the 9/11 Commission's Official Report though. That is a fact.   You should ask your leaders to let you in on their secrets.

Never, ever underestimate the strike speed of a turtle. These guys rival snakes when it comes to biting speed.  The crazy thing is that snapping turtles aren't even the worst of the lot. Look at giant soft shell turtles. (Jeremy Wade caught a medium-sized one by accident and it struck at his guide)

É assim que se reduz a pobreza. Desse jeito os prefeitos vão realmente investir em projetos que façam as pessoas saírem da pobreza.  E essa reportagem tá muito pequena, só um paragrafo. [Aqui tem mais completo](http://zh.clicrbs.com.br/rs/noticias/politica/noticia/2016/06/governo-federal-vai-premiar-prefeito-que-reduzir-o-numero-de-beneficiarios-do-bolsa-familia-6282136.htm)  edit: Aliás, eu acho que não deveria ter nada a ver com o Bolsa Família. Um prefeito deveria ganhar prêmio se conseguir um progresso significativo em fatores como IDH, renda média, acesso a saneamento básico, etc. Quanto mais esses fatores progredirem dentro do mandato do prefeito, maior deveria ser o bônus no final. Isso sim geraria bastante evolução.

I own both and I had to do side by sides on them to determine which I enjoyed more.  I actually felt I could aim better with the 700, oddly enough.  I think it's more than the feet on my 300 did not glide very well, so i was going to replace them with hyper glides, which would elevate it a tad more and make it better.  Overall the 700 felt a lot better switch wise to me, which the 300 feels a little clunky with.  Everything off course is up to personal experience, which is why I really wanted to side by side on them.  Is it smart to spend money on both?  Maybe not.
They should have named him something more vague and cool like jigglypuff 
Yes
It's the same questions and the same answers being posted on AskReddit every few days or so. Get original questions, damn. Sick of seeing the same copied-and-pasted answers every time.
Either way they make money?
Absolutely. The scene here is booming, not to mention our healthcare system, minimum wage is quite high and if you work somewhere like Melbourne, the transport infrastructure is quite good. Based on my observations, if you know .NET, you can snap up a job just like that, but Javascript is definitely an in demand skill and there is a bit of a shortage in decent Javascript developers as well.

You got anything to show me that proves this isn't just media rhetoric?   The only thing that I can be certain has changed is the ease to express your opinions and connect with other groups- which explains perfectly where you get the idea that "people are way more sensitive." Vocal minority etc. etc.
I wonder if there could be a prenup which may give her more money if she files?  I don't know/remember either of their professions though, so I guess I don't know who is actually the breadwinner...
Nope. I'm just a regular there and when I walked in the cashier asked if was looking for a small but good piece. I said I'm always looking for a good piece.   I've probably bought 5 or so bongs there and the guy decided to give me a deal and threw in the chillum. Great place. 
That game against Liquid at Manila when he singlehandedly bought them like 10 minutes because they couldn't push into his Ench was quite amazing.

Yeah, I thought planner sounded like a good idea, but it doesn't appear to be implemented well. Or maybe I just tried using it wrong.
i guess the fear still lingers from back in the day i tried 3-4 times and gave up when it used all my resources, but now i play the game 1000x more efficiently than i ever did back then but i still haven't tried to kill jad, and like i sad i keep making excuses for myself.

Suppressors aren't exactly overpowered, they decrease damage and don't hide you from player in any way, it's dumb how you can hear silenced shot from same range you will hear not silenced one.
If you liked this, then you will like the show. It's one of my favourites for scenes just like this. The first few episodes are pretty weak, but you should watch to the end of season one before deciding if you like the show.

It's the trade commissioners position, I'd bet nearly every other member of the EU is against this and I wouldn't be surprised if she was booted out if she kept insisting on this.
I've said this before and I'll say it again... new abilities do not shake up the metagame unless they're on competitively viable Pokemon.  If Bruxish is the only one that gets the ability and it has bad stats or a bad movepool, it's not going to change anything.
All I can think of now is Mastercard. Priceless.

You can use 'adb' to backup your save on your Android device without the need for root or any paid software. Look into how to install the drivers/software on your respective OS (should be *relatively* simple, I think), then all you need to do is adb backup &lt;soda dungeon's package name&gt; &lt;file to backup save to&gt; then adb restore &lt;backup filename&gt;.  Hope this helps!  P.S. I might have mixed up the order of the package name and backup file save name. You'll come across instructions on the command when installing the tools anyway I imagine.
Maria Sharapova and that dude from Nova. Big Alan Alda fan alright?
The worst part is that sometimes, it's not even the internet connection, but the server of Blizzard: like I got disconnected, my connection is fine, not even a lag noticed on Teamspeak. Why would the player be punished in this case?

You can only break status quo so many times in quick succession before there isn't a status quo to break anymore. Then it can get horrible.
It’s amazing, all this technology and it all comes back to the same two things: Make be beautiful &amp; find me love. We can zip to other continents in mere seconds. We can taste foods that died on a vine 400 years ago. We’ve found ways to seek out the past for answers, to make cars run on the heart beat’s energy, and can even fucking travel through time (if you’re willing to lose a finger).  But those suffocate underneath the quest for a button nose and a tight jaw. Why — I’d love to say it bothered me, but I’m not an idiot. Why fight what the people want. And who can blame them? We’ve conqured beauty.  You can have tom’s fat ass in your lips and he can put your celulite on his abs. Beauty! Beauty is finally a buffet.  People laughed at the name at first. Beauty Buffet? For a Gym? But, we’ve soared into our first million dollar sale. People are waking up at the crack of dawn just to exchange their fat to have a crack like Dawn’s!  The idea is simple. Michelle wants a bigger ass and Bobby wants a flatter stomach. Switch it! Claire wants a smaller breast and Johnny wants a bigger cock? No problem!  The procedure is painless. The matching takes no more than a month. Sure, now everyone kinda looks the same. Sure, I feel weird touching a woman’s breast knowing it might actually be an ass from a fat fuck. But everyone’s smiling! You can’t beat that. Business is good.  Everyone’s smiling. Sure, it’s stuck like that. But a smile’s a smile!
You should have indicated that you were joking in the first place then.

Ughhhhhhhh So it's been a rough like 20 hours. I'm meeting up with my parents this weekend for the holiday and I called last night to talk logistics and mentioned that I had taken some steps (aka HRT) that I wanted them to be prepared for. Well instead of helping it freaked them out thinking I was going to show up wearing a dress or with boobs (lol I wish HRT worked that fast) and so I had to call them back to explain, although I don't think that helped. My parents still think I'm going way too fast, although it's fine for me, and it doesn't help that I haven't talked to my dad in person yet. Anyway, psyched myself out the rest of the evening, only feeling better when wearing my bra and playing video games.   Cue this morning. I decided it would be a good idea to send my dad an email essentially coming out to him officially since I hadn't yet (everything was through my mom). So I sent this long email talking about my history and what I feel and all and then crossed my fingers and waited for a response. I did get a response in the early afternoon and it was disappointing. He asked about RLE like its a necessary thing before hormones (its not per WPATH SoC) and asked about what I'm going to do with my hobbies such as ultimate, like "is there a "trans" ultimate league?" (lol yeah right, not nearly enough of us to even form a team even if we wanted to) Also he was going through and asking like, what about your friends, what about your job, what about your family, have you thought about all that? And its like, yes Dad, I have, I've only been spending 8 hours a day on this for the last month and a half. ANYWAY, it was disappointing, but for the most part it seemed like it was misinformation/not knowing more than bigotry so maybe in time he'll come around. And I sent an extra-long email back addressing every point and question and now I'm waiting nervously again for a response.   So yeah, it's been a stressful almost 24 hours. Plus actually starting HRT and I'm feeling all sorts of out of whack. And I see them tomorrow afternoon, so we'll see how that goes.... Wish me luck ladies, and I'll maybe do updates here as the weekend progresses.... Man I wish this were easier...... Also sorry for the length lol it's been a long day
If you can search my comment history and look up "Hazard" youll see i actually rate him highly! Its the abismalness OF this last season that leaves me not skeptical but worried. Me and you both know when its Hazards day hes in the top 3 world class players. But he cant seem to shake the blues loose when its time. No pun intended.

Issue is Oesterle shouldn't be sitting in the PB, he's still developing. He also doesn't have to clear waivers. Lots of teams don't necessarily have their best 7 D in the NHL. Not sold on Gryba. Not surprised Chia wants him back though, given he's exactly the type of player he looks for.   Wis is a risk I agree, but that risk depends on a) his AAV and b) his health. To me if the doctors clear him and his cap hit isn't high for one year the risk is pretty minimal, worst case he sucks and you waive him. But when he was healthy he's easily better than any of our current guys on the PP.

The fact that you're going with 'public services' as a single entity means I know you haven't put any thought into it.  100% of them are necessary as they currently are? It's 100% efficient as well?   Get real.

That's slightly different, since, as I said, indians are a Western Mythos character.  Depictions of them are not inherently negative or positive.  If you dressed in red face, had a bottle of booze, and wore a blanket it would clearly be intended to be offensive.  But just dressing as an indian is like dressing like a character from the movies.  It's likely that the person admires Indians in some way.  But there's also nothing negative about being a butch lesbian.  If someone wanted to be a butch lesbian for Halloween, why would that be offensive?  I have red hair.  If someone went around as a "ginger" with over the top freckles and pasty white skin, I would laugh.  It's Halloween, people are having fun.

Go to India.  Stay a couple months.  It's a gorgeous country, the people are incredible, you will spend almost nothing while you are there, and you will be stripped down to your essence - whereupon you will be able to figure out what you should do, and where.
