Yeah nice... Except for the fact that everyone who contracted AIDS back then did not even know that the disease even existed.  He is clearly alluding to gay sex as being the cause as this is what religious nuts like Paul used to cry about.

Saying Karthus and morg counter Xerath because they can land skill shots when locus is active is silly. Locus Power enable Xerath to do long ranged, safe harass, and should never be used to make him vulnerable to attacks. If anything, Xerath counters Karthus and even morg to some extend due to his superior pushing and killing potential. Fizz and Sion on the other hand are pretty good counters to Xerath.

Hallo?
I was introduced to it by hospital staff while recovering from a surgery, so I'm not really sure how you've decided it was "exclusively" designed for tourists mad about a TV show. You sound like one of those people who moved to NY after college and is now bitter because it isn't the pleasant bohemian experience you want. If that assumption about you is inaccurate, then consider fucking yourself for being a hypocrite who generalizes about others out of turn.

In 8th grade I decided to love Green Day and be a lesbian and got made fun of for that. Maybe it did some good because I have a better taste in music now. It bothered me but I decided to experiment with the "tell a teacher" method that I had been taught since I was little. Let me tell you, our school had a big name for their anti-bullying policy and that sign was up everywhere, but no way did those people do anything worthwhile. If someone had said that I should punch the shit out of them and not give a shit what trouble I got into, I know that would have stopped them sooner.

I should be clearer. I /have/ used Dev C++ (back in 2005-2006 when it was considered 'good'). I didn't find it crap though that might have changed.   However I haven't used dev c++ portable (and can't verify it actually works without administrative privileges). The OPs constraints are awfully limited as well. 'Quality' is not such a driving factor as much as portability, no administrative privs, etc.

And frankly, all this saves taxpayer money. They spend 60k on this and then have fewer people in the hospital on the governments dime.   It's the equivalent of giving out first 60k worth of first aid kits, which will prevent 500k of costs on our provincial healthcare system because people don't have to go to the hospital as often.

-**Ribeye** is my favorite and easiest to cook. -**Porterhouse** to me is meh, it's just a strip sirloin and filet mignon on different sides.  More difficult to cook, filet has no beef flavor. -**Flatiron** is one of my more favorite cuts as its cheaper than most other cuts and has intense marbling but tends to not be as tender. -**Skirt** is alright if you are poor but most of the time its cut to be super thing and looks like flaps not ideal for steak cooking but for carne asada yes. -**Hangar steak** hard to find but it is firm yet a little bit tender and full of beef flavor, one of my new favorites. -**New York Strip**: one of my lesser liked cuts as its tough and very little marbling, if buying only buy prime cuts. -**Sirloin steak**: its tendy with a nice beef flavor I think of it as a between a ribeye and strip steak in terms of tenderness and beef flavor. tri tip: depending on price I will pick up prime grade if I can get it for the price of choice ribeye.  So my top 3 are: **1. Ribeye 2. Flatiron 3. Hangar** I know the last two can be hard to find so sirloin is a nice 4th option as well.

&gt;I hate to say it but I feel like the biological time to mate is during puberty.   It's really not. Women are most fertile between 24 and 26, iirc, and teen pregnancy carries a lot of inherent risks that more mature women are not vulnerable to. I think *guys* are most fertile or whatever in their teen years, but either way I don't think the "biological" excuse actually applies here at all.

When I chose to be a werewolf, it was one of those moments that deserved chanting and dramatic music. Aela drained her blood into the basin in the Underforge and I took it greedily.

I really wanted being a werewolf to actually make a bigger difference than it did.

I agree. Our secondary and run game will hold us back. We have a potent offense and our pass rush and defense against the run are top notch. I can see us beating a lot of teams like San Fran. But QB's like Rogers, Brees and Brady can do terrible things to our secondary.

As soon as you include content, you are obligated to support it. Bethesda's quality control is already laughable, imagine if they were expected to provide support for community code as well.  Most of the time, when a great idea is modded into the game, the development team simply steals the idea and adds in their own version instead. No legal qualms, and they maintain source control. See minecraft's pistons, or WoW's UI updates for examples of this in action.

Well signals generally come in the making out. the person have his/her hands all over you and kisses enthusiasticly. When your hands goes under his/her clothes he/she moves in ways to assist you, NOT twisting away, forcing you to be rough to reach where you want to go OR just lying still, ignoring you.  The person assists in his/her own undressing and helps pull the clothes of you. Actual moving to help with the sex.  If the person stops moving ABORT ABORT as he/she has now likely fallen asleep and sexual acts with unconscious person is rape.   If the person just lay there like a dead fish even though you KNOW he/she want's sex? Stop because what could be more of a turn off.

I agree.  It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging.  However, I'd say that games like MMOs, such as WoW, lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers.  Back when I played WoW, I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did, the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages.  With members of a guild, that was different; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids, etc.  For team FPS games, I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages (unless I'm staring at the spawn screen).  Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player, even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP, is beneficial to gameplay, in my opinion.

&gt;The results are not a measure of you.   This is something I've got to remember.  However, it's hard to agree with sometimes.  How do you go after something, not get it, and not think "if I were better, more skilled, etc. I'd have suceeded"?  I really do agree with the "don't be outcome dependent" mentality, but in the moment, sometimes I lose it.  How do I get there? The truth is, I'm just impatient.  I want the skills now.  The answer, I'm sure, is just experience.  Maybe I'll take this as a lesson to improve my inner game and remember my values.

That's apples and oranges. You can't say "Direct sunlight in a nutrient devoid system doesn't grow algae, so too much light usually isn't the problem" when a tank is not even comparable to that.   The fact is that too much light is the cause of most kinda of algae. If your whole plan for keeping a tank algae free is to remove all the nutrients, then how do planted tanks get by?

Check out my New Year's article from Time Square New York.
I don't think ideology is really the problem. It's more structural, the realities and necessities of power. Ideology serves only as rationale, justification, rhetorical cover as people who seek power, or seek to hold on to it, implement policies that are of benefit to the rich, influential, the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for.  Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover, while implementing corporatist BS. Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism. See e.g. USSR and Maoist China. This is the lesson of Animal Farm. Those who are convinced capitalism/free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand, Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted, and used to do great evil.  So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level, but try to improve people's understanding of the political system. It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul, they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians, or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology, or something.  They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs, or funding Israel, next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us.  System runs on hate and loathing - liberals and progressives need to be made to understand that this shit works just as well on them, as it does on RedState Rural Redneck Cons.

It's mindblowing.  In the same vein, consider the theory that there are an infinite number of universes; this means that if you were to imagine any sequence of events happening that are physically possible, no matter how long or complex, there is a universe where that has happened.

Well, eggs aren't vegan.  So no, you wouldn't be a vegan, but it's a convenient shorthand for when you're in restaurants.  Your chickens are probably not near the top of my list of things to be extraordinarily worried about, but I'm not going to say it's okay either.  (I don't think the eggs or the chickens belong to you, but "vegan" and "humane" aren't necessarily the same goal)

windex doesn't do anything that hot water wont do.  Ammonia will react with anionic salts to produce ammonium chlorides. NH4Cl is highly soluble in water so the use of windex may increase solubility but it is not necessary.  I use Hoppes 9. 
These are my husband's food groups, sweet and salty. His cholesterol is bad, but not the way you'd think. Because he's got Crohn's Disease and is missing half his large and a third of his small intestine food goes through him like shit through a goose, so to speak. He takes handfuls of Colestid pills to slow down his gut. This further reduces his cholesterol. Last time he had it checked his total cholesterol was 17.   If I ate his diet, I'd be dead in a year. 
It's not as easy as that. If someone opened the "Star Wars Cafe", clearly catering to Star Wars fans, that would be blatant trademark infringement despite being a different industry.

It's okay friend.  Yahoo mail's UI is vastly superior to Gmail atm.  Christ I was saying this to someone and he was like "oh did you try out the new gmail yet" and I thought maybe google improved it somehow yet when I chose to use the newer version, they managed to make it look even worse.
It doesn't matter what he thinks; this is a judicial matter not an executive one. If you are voting for a president soley on the content of their character then ron paul still trumps everyone else regardless of this seemingly backward libertarian view.   Sexual harrasment is a form of discrimination and is protected against under title VII of the civil rights act. Ron Paul can't do a darn thing about this. Also this was written 30 years ago; lets ask him if he and his views haven't evolved since then. I question how politically informed he was at the time he wrote this.  &lt;/end apologizing.

Drunken idiots and drug abusers in their own home should have no problems with cops. They won't be bothered there. It's when you do those things in public and disrupt other people. It's easy to not appreciate cops when they give you a speeding ticket, or you hear about one abusing his power. But when I see a cop standing in the rain at an intersection directing traffic, I feel differently.   Getting sloshed at home isn't illegal. Do it in public and you've got a problem, not that I agree it should be a problem. I understand the nature or policing people. I'm huge about minding your own business. But policemen are just doing a job, trying to provide for their families. If you don't like what they are enforcing as a whole, take it up with the government. They are the ones who create laws. 
[This NYT article](http://loyalopposition.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/beyond-eeny-meeny-miny-moe-sorting-out-the-g-o-p-field/?hp) helped me a lot:   **Michele Bachmann** is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer, who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washington. Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn, but it doesn‚Äôt fit. Ms. Bachmann is the real deal ‚Äì and for that reason, I think she has no chance of winning.  **Rick Santorum** is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held. Mr. Santorum doesn‚Äôt just talk about these issues, he‚Äôs voted on them repeatedly. He is inflexibly opposed to a woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her reproductive life. He is clearly religious but doesn‚Äôt exploit it like like Gov. Rick Perry, who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts, like a Nike swoosh. And if you really care about abortion, as in banning it, Mr. Santorum is your guy.  **Rick Perry** is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith, and don‚Äôt mind that he‚Äôs going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way. People who miss George W. Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr. Perry. That also goes for death penalty advocates. Mr. Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration, but I can‚Äôt imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office. Kind of like Mr. Bush.  **Jon Huntsman** is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions, has experience in international affairs (remember when Republicans actually cared about that?), has governing experience (as governor of Utah) and knows his way around the executive branch. You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose, big.  **Ron Paul** is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy (like admitting he‚Äôs to the left of President Obama on Iran). You have to be a libertarian, which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy. I get what happens on Day 1: You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions. What do you do on Day 2? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting?  **Newt Gingrich** is the front runner if you believe the polls. Personally, I can‚Äôt believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him. But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help, then Mr. Gingrich is the right choice. He is anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-gun control, anti-judge, anti-almost anything you can name. The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system. His positions, starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary, are far too radical. (By the way, his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate.) It‚Äôs hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman, when really he‚Äôs a history influence peddler, or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. But, if you‚Äôre a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn‚Äôt mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises, vote for Mr. Gingrich.   **Mitt Romney**. It‚Äôs hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr. Romney, because we have no clue what he actually believes. If you‚Äôre opposed to health care reform, and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area, you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes, he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he‚Äôs been taking lately. He seems like the most electable of the group right now, mostly because he‚Äôs the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers. He could, theoretically, pose the greatest threat to Mr. Obama.

You'd be surprised. We have grocery outlets here, I don't think they're usually expired but a lot of the expiry dates on "non-perishables" (canned goods, etc.) are way earlier than when the food actually goes bad. There's a lot of good stuff there that's perfectly fine, I've never bought anything that was 'bad'. But then, I don't buy there exclusively either because in some cases it's more expensive than going to our local grocery store because you can't really get what you need, just a bunch of wildcard items. It's great for personal care products, too. I go there on a whim sometimes. :D
I'm fine with the way it is now. Children can pray in public school, if it's done silently and not teacher-led. That's the way it should be, in my opinion.  It's the only fair way to do it in a secular nation full of people of different religions as well as atheists.   If you're OK with teacher-led prayer in public schools, is that only because you assume it's going to be Christian? Or would you be bothered if it was a teacher-led Muslim prayer? Or Hindu prayer? Or Wiccan?  Granted, in private schools, children can pray out loud and have it be teacher-led. So, if you want your kid to be able to experience teacher-led prayer, send them to private school...  As it stands now, no one is barring kids from praying silently in class, to themselves. I think that's the way it should be.

I'm not saying he is.  I'm simply trying to point out that even if he hated this thing in its entirety, he was still powerless to stop it.  I personally believe him when he said he was opposed to large swaths of this bill.

Not me but this guy at my old church in my youth group was caught by my youth pastor having sex with a random non church going girl behind the church one day. The youth pastor talked to him about it and the dude had the balls to keep coming back to church and all other meetings like bible study and act like nothing ever happened and then ask out my little sister. Oh **HELL NO**. Few people knew about it despite it being a small church. This was back when my parents dragged me to church, which obviously was a great experience. (*sarcasm*)

&gt;that's about the same as when people think of someone who is gay, they think of an effeminate, limp-wristed, lisping waif who is obsessed with fashion, decorating, and has AIDS.  To be fair, Richard Dawkins, [Christopher Hitchens, Bill Maher, and Penn Jillette](http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/article/9/1/0/107910.jpg?v=1) actually do exist, and *do* shout from the heavens their antitheism, while the limp wristed flamboyant gay guy doesn't exist, *or* go around shouting he's gay.  And you mistake me. I'm not saying all know-it-all cockbags are atheists, or that all atheists are know-it-all cockbags. I'm saying that the *most vocal* atheists are know-it-all cockbags, and that's why people don't like atheists. It has little to do with their disbelief, and more to do with their expression of it.

&gt;Really? Merriam-Websters dictionary is what you filter theological ideas through?  I don't have any theological ideas seeing that I don't believe in theology (being an atheist and all).  However, when I need to debate the definition or meaning of a word, I find Merriam Webster a good source to reference.  If you'll look closely, there are three definitions given for magic.  I'm referring to definition 2. &gt;2 a : an extraordinary power or influence seemingly from a supernatural source  I find this an adequate definition of how christians describe the powers of Yahweh.  Not a strawman.  As for the zombie bit, if you were intellectually honest you'd admit that the 'full likeness' claim is the ONLY thing your argument has going for it.

Well, I'm sorry that you had a rough time in Algebra 1.  I teach Algebra 1, Precalculus, and AP Calculus.  If you had been my student We would have done much better than Cs. The mention of the GRE is interesting.  Let's say for example you had your own method to solve equations.  Let's say your brain could deduce a close estimate to the right answer and just started plugging in numbers until you got the correct one.  The problem with this, and the heart of the matter here, is that "Hooray you got the Algebra 1 type problem right."  Now you move on to the more complicated problems and Uh oh!  Its a three variable system.  All of a sudden plugging in numbers doesn't work anymore.  You may still solve the problem, and you may not. Some of what you mention dyslexia, getting marks off for using the wrong words (not really sure what you meant by that), discalculia, etc are things that must be attacked on an individual level. Lastly, while I believe learning the most appropriate method is awesome for high school level, it starts to lose a little bit of its importance in college, where creativity in math is often rewarded.

There's no such thing. Good sex is what feels good to you and your partner and makes you both feel happy and comfortable. For some people, this is porn-like sex; for some, it's something totally different.  Comparing your IRL sex to porn is a lot like refusing to date any woman who doesn't look like Carmen Electra: unrealistic, exhausting, and ultimately unfulfilling.

well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist. Lets take Cuba first. It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s. Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America. There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US' terrorist war and blockade of the island.  In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years, illiteracy has been wiped out, there are 50% more people voting in elections than before, malnourishment has been banished forever etc.   There's a common idea that what was called 'socialism' in Eastern Europe failed. Well, it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument. I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world. Since 1989 the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again. Sure, GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything, such as the right to not die or the right to go to school.   At the heart of your question is what constitutes being 'poor'. I really don't think there are any poor countries left- maybe 200-300 years ago there were. Let me explain; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of 'poor places'. But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British. Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities, gold dripping from wall to wall. Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world. And yet it may have more natural resources than any other. It is teeming with minerals and metals. Where's the money going? Into Dutch oil companies, Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies. In fact, the countries which 'should' be poorest, those with the least amount of resources, are the richest (western europe). There are no poor countries, only poor people.   What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out, these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s. There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now, but, because of capitalism, the majority of the world still lives in poverty. So, in answer, the people would be much better off under socialism.

With these suggested foregrip changes, guns with high horizontal recoil will be unusable in close quarters (this includes g36c, g53, A-91, qbz-95b, f2000, famas, aek-971, kh2002) no matter what you attach into them other than a crap bipod. And attaching a bipod to carbines listed above is just retarded since it takes 7 bullets to kill on longer ranges (something that I'd never understand). Even if you tried to attach a heavy barrel next to foregrip to these carbines, you'll just have to resort to your pistol in CQB as an engineer which shouldn't be happening.  Alan Kertz will kill any run&amp;gun play there is on close quarters with these changes and everybody will have to use low horizontal recoil weapons if they want to do so like m416, m16, m4 with either a suppressor or laser without foregrip.   Suggested changes will basically make everyone start using the same weapons without foregrips or bipod then he'll come back here and bitch about everyone using the same 3-4 weapons as Assault and Engineer and not attaching a bipod or foregrip. He'll probably keep continuing by nerfing those since they'll all be overused by then.  Making foregrip reduce horizontal recoil by 0.1 deg on all weapons gotta be the worst idea this guy ever suggested. My bet is that it'll be in the next patch since he's basically screwing the game over and over again every patch.

What, if her dad suddenly started manipulating reality like conjuring magic missiles, that would be 100% indicative of god's existence?  Even if he claims his magical powers come from god, historically most sorcerers were patrons of some god - Ba'al, Ra, etc. For example, just because Melisandre can see the future in flames does not mean that R'holler exists.

Try your hardest to play with a Support guy.  And please, please, don't play Recon. Unless your got more than 5 hours, don't try Recon. I can't stand useless Recons.

It really depends on what country you live in. A lot of the European countries have professional leagues that have specific seasons during each year. In the US, if women are still in school they can play in the NCAA league. While other countries are sometimes centralized in a specific city, or play for club leagues during the year. However, most teams come together to centralize a few months before major competitions (World Championships, Olympics, etc...)

Hi, I really appreciated your post, you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field(obviously, if you've got a PhD, you've put a lot of work into it, so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and, while I haven't personally contracted your services, I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough). I have a few questions, I do have a few mental health issues, but they aren't rare at all, and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals(multiple psychiatrists, all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period, a psychologist, a social worker with a doctorate in social work, and some regular social workers, as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was 17(I'm 19 now, going to be 20 on Jan 21st, and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community). Basically, I've just got run of the mill depression, panic disorder, as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes me extreme chronic pain, I have seen palliative care physicians, neurologists, physiatrists(not the same as a psychiatrist), and pain management physicians(anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine), neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and of course a few internists, all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis. The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part(though, I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode, I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like).   Basically, the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things, things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain, like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games, walking up stairs, going to the store, but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance. It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation(though at times my motivation is low), but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent. For example, my last year of high school(I graduated in 2010) I missed at least two days every week, I still graduated in the top 25% of my class, and graduated with honors, but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to(Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations, tendon/ligament injuries, etc), the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain(I have a syrinx in my spinal cord, you'd understand what it is if you look it up, if you don't already, it is usually caused by a chiari malformation, which I don't really have).  The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life. But, I have big dreams, I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist, those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me, and I love studying them. But, due in part to my depression, and pain, I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities. You see, when I was in 1st grade, I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability(the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around 5-6 hours, I had to redo this testing every couple of years, all of the testing took 5-6 hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there). During school, I was in a special ed class to help with my math(but in a regular math class, the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it, and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed, I'm sure you understand the special education system). However, I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself, nor have I learned much about it, I don't even know the name of the disorder. I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability, I mean, I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities, but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all, if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability(as in, what IS my disability, I can understand medical and psychological information with ease, I've considered going into medicine even). The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology, psychology, or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus, as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required, including calculus. Therefore, I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician, medical doctor, or academic, and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression. TL;DR- Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses.  NOTE: I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions, but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally, and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever. I am not asking for medical or psychological advice, as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally, it'd be a legal liability on your part.   If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message, or have more specific questions to ask me, please feel free to send them in a private message. I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post.  Regards,   -Nick W.

This question isn't "can we afford to do so."  We couldn't afford the last 2 wars but that didn't stop us.  No.  The answer is, they have no natural resources.  If the U.S. government was really concerned with spreading democracy we would have invaded and liberated saudi Arabia from their oppressive dictatorship.  But it just so happens that the dictators in Saudi Arabia are cozy with the U.S. military so no need to liberate them.

Mine was rather similar to yours.  A very small sudden injury to my thumb.  Tore a small piece out of the middle of the thumb nail, leaving jagged shards of nail in the wound.  Extremely painful, but so small I thought I could just shrug it off.  I tried shaking my hand - big mistake.  Then I tried running cold water over it - another mistake.  Then I tried ignoring it.  Next thing I knew I was on the floor and my friends were picking me up.  I had gone completely unconscious, face first, down to the cement floor, but fortunately my face was saved because I was close enough to the wall to hit my forehead into that first.  Left a good sized hole in the drywall, and cut my forehead a bit, but that was really nothing, compared to the pain in my thumb.  I had always heard about how bamboo under the fingernails was a terrible torture, now I think I know what it feels like.  Only thing I wonder now, is how they keep the victim awake long enough to question them.

Saying a country has a small population as a reason why their policies won't work here is just being intellectually lazy.  Yeah, some things might not work, but it doesn't make it so for every social program. For example, single payer health insurance is superior in every single way over our current for-profit health insurance.  Insurance works better over the largest pool of people.  So having everyone on single payer is better than having huge gaps in insurance coverage.  But, I am betting by your ugh is that you are already completely closed minded about this.  But prove me wrong...it would be a nice shock.

Since no one has mentioned this, I'd like to throw this in:  Depends on how you define the terms "smart" and "smarter".  Also, the dinosaurs had very small brains with huge bodies and that didn't seem to affect too much their "body map" and/or enteric functions. I personally think that intelligence can be of different varieties like vision can be of different varieties (night vision/ sonic vision/ regular vision for example). Each type of intelligence may have its own priorities, so we may not be comparing apples to apples here. Things that are important to us and therefore "smart" maybe just downright retarded for whales (not to imply anything here either way btw) or another type of intelligence.

How do you get PvE gear?  Only PvE gear I've got during a week of lvl50 are "epic" item mods for daily tokens on Ilum (you can earn around 20 tokens daily, hilts/barrels/armor mods cost 8 tokens apiece). Gear is similar to lowest level PvP sets you can find on fleet pvp vendor (centurion?) Daily PvE quests on Ilum require hours of time if solo - NPCs are tougher than on other planets.  How do you get PVP gear? (And highend PVP gear)  2 daily PvP quests (win 3 warzones + flip 5 points on Ilum) provide 1 champion bag each. 2 weekly quests (win 9 warzones + flip 15 points on Ilum) gives 3 bags each. Drop rate from the bags is around 1:3 / 1:4 (some people reporting 32 bags without single item drop) - so in my opinion it doesn't worth time to farm 800 warzone commendations to get a bag with semi-useless 3 tokens.  Where are the daily quest hubs?  I've found dailies on Ilum and Belsavis (there are lvl50 parts of map on 41-43 Belsavis, you will be sent to there by a quest giver on Imperial fleet). I suspect there are dailies on Corellia but I didn't finished "secondary" quest line there yet.

Ok, I actually read the bill and I don't see ANYthing wrong with it. Here is the main portion of the bill:  &gt; (a) IN GENERAL- That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.  So the bill authorizes self defense against people who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the 9/11 attack, in order to prevent more in the future.  Sounds like a good bill to me.

The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited.  Ron Paul - Bill of rights http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul259.html  *If anything, the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states. If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility, we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases ‚Äî not only when it serves our interests. The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law, not federal law. Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property, but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level. The people of New London, Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place.* **Ron Paul lying about the Constitution**  The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America, with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance. Throughout our nation's history, **churches have done what no government can ever do, namely teach morality and civility. Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong, and hence have little need for external government. This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion: Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance, and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state. Knowing this, the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion, chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage. Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war.  "The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers. On the contrary, our Founders' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs. Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, both replete with references to God, would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion."  **Ron Paul on sexual harassment**  "Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity," Paul wrote. "Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended, **but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable."  **Ron Paul - We the people act**  The We the People Act forbids federal courts, including the Supreme Court, from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or "privacy,"* including cases involving sexual practices, sexual orientation or reproduction. The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage. In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers, the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President, according to rules established by the Congress.

No! I like mine dehydrated and solid as a rock. It retains the taste but smells much better and has a really nice texture! The only issue is that depending on the power of the microwave and skill of the cook it can take ages and come out awful.  For example, I put mine in for 1 minute bursts and leave the door open for a few seconds to let the water vapour out. 5 of these and it's perfect in mine, but 5 minutes at once and it comes out quite disgusting - not flaccid like, but the fat is all mangled and horrible, just nasty, all of it.  I am very adamant when it comes to my bacon, if you serve me crap bacon I will refuse to eat it, which is something that only beef shares that honor with.  Edit: HAPPY NEW YEAR IT'S 00:00GMT! WHOOO I'm pissed as a pancake, so forgive my poor explanation of my bacon preferences and reasoning behind it, I wish you all the best.

It's somewhat ironic that you rage about reposts, and then follow that up with a repost of our perhaps most frequently asked question.  So the answer is: people who are new, such as yourself obviously, haven't seen all the existing content (they'd have to spend months browsing the archive to get just a glimpse) and so to some people it's all new.  Two solutions for you personally:  * don't read the reposts * post new content of your own.

Reminds me of the first adult joke I ever heard and was confused by. I was peeking through my mom's door as she watched that guy, Goddfried-something? Scratchy-Voice-of-the-*Aladdin*-Parrot Man.  The joke was that he was fooling around with some girl and she told him to stick a finger in her. It grossed him out, but he did. Then she asked for two fingers, then the whole hand. The other hand. Up to the elbows, and then to his shoulders -- then she looked down at him and said, "Tight, huh?"

2011 made me think life was turning around.  It suggested the concept that I might be able to finally not feel like a shitty waste of life, but then, it said "Fuck that, you don't deserve to be happy!"  And threw everything back in my face. These sentiments of "Fuck 2011" are echoed by me.  A year of false promises and endless strife and bullshit.  I can't wait to put it behind me, and ring in the new year with the best solution to problems I've ever discovered -- alcoholism. I'm at a party, I have a fifth of Russian Standard, and a handle of Pinnacle.  I will be drunk.  So drunk that I won't give any fucks about whatever happens tonight, despite the people here (one of whom was the principle lie of 2011.)  I'll get fucking wasted and wake up to what I can only hope will be a new chance. Fuck you 2011, and 2012, may you bring something better, or the end of the world.  Either are acceptable.

Seems kind of high-minded to assume you know what God is thinking. I think any being capable of creating a universe is probably a bit more morally evolved than to say, "Oh, he doesn't like me? To hell with him!"  Telling a person that their individual path to spiritual enlightenment is wrong causes stagnation of our culture and condemns mankind to a slow, lonesome death.

&gt;The one lesson we need to learn from all of this is that our government is DEEPLY in bed with corporate interests...  For the sake of discussion, allow me to disagree with you. I think a better lesson is that politicians can not understand the implications of what they do, nor be informed enough about every person in the country, let alone the world, to plan their lives for them.  Their excuse is that they are trying to "save" jobs. If they really were looking out for every American they would be trying to get as much information as possible from the people that would have the most / best information on the subject.  It is entirely possible that they are doing exactly that and it isn't so much that they are "in bed with corporate interests", but that what we are seeing is the side effect of entrusting them with an impossible task.  On the extreme, lets not worry so much about who is getting to decide which books go into the bon fire and start making it clear that we are against book burning.

But the grinding can be brutal at time. Killing 200 philistines, and removing their foreskins? I could have done without the harvesting animations. The gamedevs must have one sick sense of humor.  Also, with the Red Cross now saying military FPS games should seek to minimize civilian casualties, or at least discuss the issue of warcrimes, they will have a field day with this game. The Amelkhite campaign is especially nasty. Upset you can't kill kids in Skyrim or Fallout 3? Well, no problem here. The only ones you can't kill are the female virgins.

&gt;When men can become impregnated, carry a baby to term, and give birth - we may have reproductive equality. Until then, biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible.  All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent. I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights **under this one circumstance:** which is, if the child is her's because it's in her body, then it's her's after birth as well. If a father feels like ditching the kid, it's now his right because it didn't come from his body, and until men can give birth, they don't need to take responsibility for kids.   Again, I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent. If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body, then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body.  If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies, then women can't force men to take care of their children. If you don't agree with this, then tell me how you're being logically consistent. That is, how can you apply the logic to women, but not to men.

I have a super fast metabolism and I've been struggling with it lately, tell them you used to eat 5 times a day and lately you just haven't been eating enough due to life circumstances(stress, no time, someone in the family is sick). It's the closest you can let the truth out without actually disclosing the real problem.   It's hard to be politically correct in this situation because some people just might be commenting on wanting you to look healthier and better and you can't fault them for that since they don't know your issue, so you won't want to be a bitch but you don't want to disclose the truth.

Said it once before but it bears repeating.  Broke my boyfriend's penis. I'll preface this with saying he was my first sexual partner. It was my first time on top, and I was bouncing hard, like they show on porn. Unfortunately, he wasn't that big. He slipped out, I heard a crack as I bounced back down HARD. I hit him so hard, my pelvis connected with his, regardless of his penis being in the way. He screamed and threw me off of him, beginning to cry. I didn't know a penis could make that sort of snapping noise. Long story short, his penis turned black and purple. It bends the other way now. We got married this September. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Penisfraktur_01.jpg Pretty much what it looked like. Warning, NSFL. I'd also like to mention that I did attempt to give him a blowjob while he was healing, instead of having sex (THAT was interesting).
there are a lot of sticky rules to being an actual corporation, and if you don't follow all of them to the T, then in court you will be ruled as a sole prop, and lose all of the protections you thought you had as an LLC. You can't just file LLC (or S or C or any other corp) and say 'I am safe'. If you are doing enough business that your personal assets are at risk, then seek the advice of a lawyer, and not the professionals on reddit.

I'm glad you were able to come out without anything physical happening to you. Actually, my relationship before this one was exactly like that. He had guns, and he would break shit, but he knew to never lay a finger on me. I've unfortunately ended up with two bad boyfriends back to back (but a great history before them which gives me hope), so I am going to take some time for myself, friends, and family, and give dating a rest due to the trauma over the last couple of years. It saddens me since I am very a bright woman who usually makes good life choices, but these two guys hid it from everyone else in their lives. it shows it can happen to anyone.
Honestly, that's probably a good way to go about it. Lucky you having a small enough school to have a class with her! Just try it, and try to be chill about it. Just say hey, and chat for a while. Don't let yourself worry too much about the fact that she's a pretty girl. She's just like everyone else, so make her feel like that.  And sorry if I made you feel like a little kid! I bet you are very mature for your age, but trust me when I say this, I'm 20 now, and I was mature for my age when I was 14 too, and you still change a LOT. So don't worry about it :)
Glad to hear it!

I was mostly wondering how long it had been since Algebra 1 for you.   I dunno about the 'grading people down for being bad at english' bit though. I remember Algebra 1 as something like an introduction to proofs/number theory/fields more than anything else. Using the right words is half the point of learning proofs, and learning proofs is why Algebra 1 is a not-very-enforced pre-req.

Ive heard of many famous people getting both life and death masks. What was the purpose of doing this? Was it expensive? 
The aim is to get them to talk about what they are passionate about. People talking about their passion are interesting because the emotion is contagious.  Once you have them talking about what makes them interesting, steer the conversation towards a mutual subject that you are also passionate about.

Try to find a correlation between thoughts/feelings you may have preceding a binge. For many people (perhaps you, perhaps not) binge eating is an emotional suppression reflex that activates around memories, feelings or trauma that our subconscious wants to avoid. It's very difficult to overcome without guidance, because our subconscious can get what it needs without us really being aware in the moment. Though we become all too aware in the aftermath, when trying to recover from a binge.  If it's at all possible, speak with a psychotherapist.
you should be better than that.  hufflepuff has merits, too!
Thank you. I'm trying to keep my head up, focus on making 2012 a much better year (the first year without him).  We can totally do it! Keep up the good work. I'm proud of you! 
yeah man, shell out that five dollars for me and give me that sense of security that I won't get charged with a 250 dollar fine. after that, I can only assume that we're clearly destined to be together.  
Wow bro, you're so hardcore!!
thanks man, and sorry im new to this subredit.  I just started to read the guide.   added you!
It's neither angry, nor is it nonsense. Though I can see how being filled with righteousness might make it seem that way.   Your mistake is thinking that what you *feel* is right is justified.  You're argument is specious. Not only are you blinded by your own zeal ('terrorists', tyrant') but you are attempting to press your opinion into service as fact. Not only is this incorrect, but it demonstrates a lack of maturity.   "Because I really want it to be so" does not make it so. Not in this country, anyway. 
No they can if you are cheating. Well could... and steam does sometimes screw people but a lot less than EA.

Provide citation from that signed bill that proves American citizens can be indefinitely detained or terror suspects no longer have access to civilian trials.  After all, the *burden of proof* for your claims is your responsibility in political, academic, or any other kind of debate.  Until, you provide citation that supports those claims about NDAA, you are just another unfortunate person regurgitating unsupported talking points.  (Hint:  Lots of us have already read President Obama's signing statement regarding NDAA and know it clearly states the indefinite detention of American citizens is not allowed).
Are you sure your breasts are up to it?

I'm pretty sure racism covers more than just "I hate 100% of black people 100% percent of the time." Race was a factor in the media's perception of Peyton Hillis last year, and that definitely had some influence in his inclusion on the ballot.

Driving in GTA IV is pretty key gameplay mechanic, there's not just the odd driving mission like the tank one in GoW, there are plenty of driving missions because you're stealing cars and escaping from cops. I don't think it's too much for the devs to ask that you figure out to drive by the time the driving missions role around.
No you're not stupid, don't change it.  Coin flips are not the most accurate randomizations of a 50% chance.  There has been a lot of research done that most coin flips do not rotate enough to be randomized enough.  Just google it.   6 sided dice, given enough tosses in the hand, are a much better way of generating a random 50/50 chance.  Oh I like your cards btw.

Mr. Literal Larry. I know you know what they mean and I am disappoint.
Alone here, a thousand kilometres away from my friends, family and girlfriend.  Give me a dozen reds.
My husband and I ride.  I just started last month.  He's been riding for years.  He just got back from a great ride. Yes, it's wet.  If you're not comfortable in that, don't ride.  If you are, then you're golden.  Yes there are hills.  There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain.  If all else fails, there's a great bus system in place.  I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider, but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month.  Even several times this week.  I got rained on once, but I have waterproof gear, so I didn't care, other than being my first time in the rain.  The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists.  At least I haven't noticed a problem yet.  But even when driving I like Seattle drivers.  However, we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there.  So *anywhere* seems tame and normal after that for 10 years.  People use turn signals here to indicate a turn.  Other drivers see that and respect it.  There are far fewer tailgaters here.  The pace is generally much much slower, about the speed limit rather than 20 mph above it.  The roads are noisier, though. There are quite a few Seattleites over on /r/motorcycles.  So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it.  I haven't ridden anywhere else, but I like riding here.  So much to see and do, fun roads and straight roads, highways and country roads.  My husband likes to drive up to the mountains, turn around and come home.  
Link?
I like how it draws attention to the stretch marks.
have you seen it!?
I googled a random youtube playlist that had the format  http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=_____________  And looking at the chilleddubstepmusic page and then going to the playlists, the url http://www.youtube.com/user/ChilledDubstepMusic?ob=video-mustangbase#p/c/7CFC0438B72B8C00 contained a string of numbers and letters at the end which i assumed was a playlist ID. So I just copy-pasted it.
Doctors, as in your family physician, are *not* scientists. They are not trained in research nor trained like scientists are in not mistaking correlation for causation, in proper methodology to reduce confirmation or other biases. As such, when a doctor thinks there's a link, just because they've seen a few cases, isn't really better than anecdotal evidence. It's certainly not research-quality data.

I see in other posts you are citing instances when farmers try to save seed to plant in the new year.  I just would like let you know that this is so very very rare.  The losses a farmer faces in yield from losing hybrid vigor are much to large for seed cleaning to be a viable enterprise for any farmer.

Everything that you mentioned is all graphics as in complete bullshit that doesn't effect gameplay. Bullet drop is the same, hit registration is just as bad. The old maps could have supported 64 players if they added more spawn points all of these features were possible before they just restricted them. Your argument for why it is different is that they released the game they promised 3 years ago and labeled everything that should have been in the last game as a new feature?
It seems the game has been to proclaim the NDAA does not apply to citizens, so let it go through - then come in through the back door and amend it with another bill, Lieberman's S. 1698: Enemy Expatriation Act which allows the government to remove your citizenship and then use NDAA on you: "A bill to add engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality."  http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s112-1698
They don't sell health insurance that has a longer term. Life insurance is a different thing. There are one time payment policies and sometimes there are price increase agreements. With health insurance like car insurance they reserve the right to change the underwriting with the renewal.
Anyone who drives down Dundas during rush hour is going to be late anyways. Pick a better route, or just get on that streetcar you can't seem to pass.
That's just speculation, in the face of fact: had they gotten the goal, you're looking at a 4-2 loss for England either way. That being said, England's problems are much, much deeper than a goal that they should have been awarded. And Germany, well, in my opinion, they are the new Spain. A relatively young team that is now coming into its time and that I expect to do very well in the coming years.
wow you must be pretty anoying to conterfeat that nice body
Obama has the *power* to do that. Just like any other president who is elected in the future (now that the bill has been signed). I don't think his reassurances will stand up to scrutiny when he establishes martial law.   &gt;"jk guys! I really just wanted a police force."

People DO NOT understand what libertarianism is.  It's not something you want thrust upon you.  It's something you want a society to choose.  I'm actually a free market anarchist, and we always talk about outgrowing the need for the state, not overthrowing it, or shrinking it down to nothing.

I don't get it - are you looking for someone else's opinion to agree with?  I think it's good that you want to read more and get more involved in politics, but it sounds like you're looking for a pre-existing box to fall into.  I would recommend reading up on philosophy instead of politics. Politicians have always wanted to change your opinions, which means you won't ever *really* discover "where you fall on the map".
I've seen a picture of that.  My eyes still bleed.

Dark souls isn't artificial difficulty at all. For instance after I beat the game, went back through on NG+ and decided to make a new character. I beat the entire game and maybe only died once or twice. The game is the reverse of artificial difficulty (which would be something like those wii games that take a simple task and make it impossible with a bunch of bullshit).

What happens when Obama points out how he's being forced into a corner?  He's called weak and gets two minutes of air time while those who call him weak and a sell-out get the next 58, and that's on the more "friendly" networks.  Look what's happening on Reddit, anyone who in the last weeks has presented an argument of two paragraphs or more, *while pointing to and quoting the damn bills provisions*, are downvoted and ridiculed while those who flip the president the bird get upvoted just for doing so.

Damn, now I can really tell I am straight. Shit, this should be the meter of straightdom!
Back in 2002, we Americans were being told of a connection between Iraq and 9/11 -- remember the supposed meeting between Mohammed Atta and Saddam in Czechoslovakia?  That turned out to be all lies. And now those lies are being recycled and fed anew to gullible Americans, With "Iran" in place of "Iraq".  Gareth Porter offers a comprehensive debunking of the recent show-trial verdict.  See ["Crackpot Anti-Islam Activists, ‚ÄòSerial Fabricators,‚Äô and the Tale of Iran and 9/11"](http://original.antiwar.com/porter/2011/12/30/the-tale-of-iran-and-911/), *Truthout*, 31 Dec 2011.  Incredibly, the witnesses were not cross-examined!  Porter also summarizes Iran's record of cooperation with the U.S. in the apprehension of Al Qaeda.  Let's recall that Iran itself is a victim of terrorism -- most of it the work of MeK.  . .  We should not be complacent, but there are at least a few signs that our vehement opposition to another U.S.-initiated war may be having an effect.  Recently, the neo-con high-priests at the American Enterprise Institute admitted that Iran is *not* a nuclear threat.  In Israel the former head of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, has called the planned attack on Iran ["the stupidest thing I've ever heard"](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-mossad-chief-israel-air-strike-on-iran-stupidest-thing-i-have-ever-heard-1.360367).  And now the current head of the Mossad, Tamir Pardo, is saying that [Iran does *not* pose an existential threat to Israel](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/12/30/mossad-chief-iranian-nuclear-weapon-wouldnt-be-existential-threat/).  Hard to believe, but our rulers may actually be sobering up!

I am pointing out the obvious falsehood that this program has merit educationally.  If it has any medical merit, it is simply a species of Tylenol given, a financial decision made with humans as stock, as money, because it's cheaper. Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan, too.  Human life is incalculable, the $60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace, diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one.  The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual:  if you are in a hole, stop digging. The suffering is a result of human choice, weakness, arrogance, greed, folly.  Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - *know* that they are crackheads. Really.  True story.  This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts.  Sophistry, milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity, and politics - in a word, human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction.  Fracture that central concept any way you wish, you still have a piece of the same pie.  Please downvote me further, or if you can, expose the falsity of what I say.  Puerile ingrates are the result of same.  These people need help, and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering.  Enter any store in the neighbourhood; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold, in some cases openly.  A wee rose in a glass tube, other 'glassware'.  It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one:  the net result to the crack user is exactly the same.  Think about that and rebut it, because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction, into deepened and not lessened misery, as they walk the common road to death multifarious.

Why do you say "white rights" groups are dangerous? Either all ethnic rights groups are dangerous, or none of them are. That is equality. What you are advocating is discrimination based on ethnicity, which is the reason people have been exploited in the first place!  Whether or not the agenda of this "white rights" caucus might terrible, it should be judged on it's own merits, not based on the history we are trying to move away from.

People like the idiot on Facebook that made that pic aren't supposed to understand memes. That's part of what makes them funny. As long as those people stay off reddit and stay on Facebook, I'm happy. From a redditor's point of view, facebook is for viewing idiots in their natural environment, filled with other idiots.

I live in the city, so I have a lot of them.  One day I was walking down the street and this homeless guy, instead of asking for change, just goes "Ah, you're wearin' beach colors!"  The best times were with my boyfriend, though. The first time he came to the city we were walking and a homeless guy said to my boyfriend, "You guys are a great couple! If you wrote a book, I would buy it." Another time, a homeless guy who was peeing in an alley said "Y'all still looking great together!" and then later tried to pass us saying, "Man, you in my way, but you got a fine girl."  ETA: One time this older non-threatening seeming woman came up to me, looked me straight in the eye, and goes "Are you fucking with me?"

The contest just closed. People in /r/assistance were downvoting the offer so it won't show up on the front page of that subreddit and they will be the only ones who could see it. It just goes to show you the type of people trolling this site. I posted on here so that more people could see it and have a chance at getting something.
Bro-five!
And then sometimes there's a time and a place for RES  &gt;source  [](/c01 "&lt;3 you too") 
Try subscribing to r/dwarffortress, every now and then you see a post asking for the best way to kill a bunch of cats, confusing as hell.
Madagascar has nothing on this shit. Bring on the pandemic.
"I was saying if this was all in my head then no one could prove or disprove that I actually saw it"  Thats not what you said, you said that only schizoids could prove or disprove what you saw, and if it was in your head they could disprove or prove it as much as anyone else. They cant. Nobody can disprove anything that happend inside someone elses head.   Tho, considering your illness we can with certainly say that it was just a silly illusion.  
Millions of people believe in various deities, it doesn't mean they're right nonetheless.   Have an upvote anyway. Cheers!

Both you and Lifeaftercollege are not giving any references or sources, your arguments are invalid.
I read this in Wrex's voice from Mass Effect.
You're making money, can't beat that. You here at the African resort?

Watch out, the laker minions are about to catch hold of this comment

I should have mentioned, it was limited to 500 words or less, so that's why she decided to write it more as a character portrait or vignette. I don't know the terminology, so that's my fault for calling it a story I guess. Thanks for the feedback though!
I still got to see some tits so it's all good :-)
Happy New Year reddit! I passed over going to a pretty big party with a guestlist/bouncers and all the trimmings to browse you, read my book and eat chicken in my pants. I regret nothing.
I've heard good things about the m audio bx5a, can you vouch for that? Or do you have a preference? I'm liking those even more because I've found them for about $150 new
I heard about NG from his IAMA. Haven't stopped listening constantly since then. 
He's ready to rip your soul out.
so proud to see a swiss footballer in that kind of list. thanks Shaq
May 2012 bring you 1080p
We didn't know that until we got there around 8:30. By their site it seemed like no reservations at all. But we're planning on stopping by earlier next time and doing that. This party of 4 next to us waited for like 4 hours x_x
On topic (kind of), I watched the 2 girls video and considering all I've heard, I was like, "That's it?" I don't know if I'm messed up or what, but I haven't seen anything on the internet that truly shocked me or make me feel sick. 
Good, fuck him.
I'm more than Ok with that.
This can be said about almost every question on here.
Forever alone with Vette... :\  I guess I'll go find Jack in Mass Effect 3

&gt; Once played a ZvZ. **I got offensively gg'd** during a push of his, then I held and countered, proceeding to dismantle his army and take him out.  &gt; What does he do? Expands everywhere across the map and sends ling and muta harassment squads to try and snipe me whilst refusing to leave the game and **literally throwing every single insult at me in the dictionary, and demanding that I leave because he "rightfully won."**
not to mention that Einstein was on the fence about religion and even claimed to have a God only he had a different belief about him so using Einstien would only make you look stupid.
To the extent that he identifies as a conservative, Paul considers himself a paleoconservative.  The point being that what he criticizes in conservatives is their leftist deviation from what he takes to be orthodox conservatism.  Paleos believe that the Republican Party and conservative movement were hijacked by the leftist, ex-Trotskyite neocons.  
Agreed.  Bush was compared to a monkey all the time.  I agree that historically, comparing people who happened to be black to monkeys has been used with racist connotations, but that does not mean *everyone* who makes the comparison is automatically being racist by doing so.  You can't assume what is in a person's heart.  Also, being ignorant, such as to the sensitivity of an issue, is not necessarily the same thing as being bigoted.  I also get very suspicious when the only people crying "racism/sexism/etc." happen to be from a group not allegedly targeted by the remark/comparison/etc. in question.
I was shot 5 times in the leg, hit with a baseball bat to the head twice and had 6 fingers broken.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration covers the pros/cons pretty well.  Not mentioned in the wiki is the fact that chemical castration also delays the onset of male pattern baldness by suppressing testosterone.  Though... it's a high price to pay for a full head of hair.
Probably because I didn't contribute at all to the subreddit, but I still feel this is an appropriate way to thank you all for the numerous quality drams I've enjoyed :) 
What?  Oh, wait, you mean being released from prison. Don't even get me started on our prison system here in America. We take muggers and make them murderers.
Why is the album called 'suck a dick Reddit'?

No mention of Real Genius?
yes but it is very difficult to over eat if I'm not eating carbs thats my point.  Ninja edit: to be more specific I understand that I could also lose weight and still consume carbs but then I would need to plan as you say by counting calories to make sure I don't over eat. By not having carbs in my diet I don't have to count calories because it is almost impossible to over eat when dieting on meats and veggies alone.
Got [these](http://imgur.com/a/qq1nJ#0) off a site a while back, they are not my own, but I uploaded them for ya.
Strange how much of a dick a forge looks like at this angle.
&gt;I expect NDAA was put through to give them the power to round up dissidents, OWS and the like, and SOPA will be put through to allow them to quash internet sites that foment dissent.  here we agree, i think all thats possible and it shouldnt be.  the law shouldnt have passed.  &gt;Monarch, Oligarch, Plutarch. Whatever.  my point is those are different things

The indefinite detention portions will likely face a court challenge, and maybe even go all the way to Supreme Court. A precedent has already been set, too (Hamdi vs Rumsfeld).
As a service member I would have been fine with him telling the Republicans to fuck off. Yes I realize I am the minority.
That's one of the best rages I've ever seen.
Man I feel bad for ya, I'm sitting her blazed with my parents watching Beavis and Butthead waiting for the New Years show. True story
Let the wins speak for themselves.  I personally try not to make any judgements about my opponent and let that person's skill at the game do the talking.  You will also find that terrible players complain in same fashion you spoke of, regardless of who they are playing against.  
This game was awesome! I was very young when I played it though, and I remember it scared me a bit.
Models (actresses/musicians/etc) are a human with flaws that have the resources to spackle on perfection.   I feel sorry for the folks who think that what they see is in any way "natural"  [Case in point](http://www.makeherup.com/2010/12/30/russell-brand-posts-picture-of-katy-perry-makeup-free-and-in-bed/).

I used to use an AVR-3308, the older version of the Denon AVR-3312CI. I was really happy with the Dolby Digital / DTS decoding, and it does a good job with 2 channel as well. I don't have much experience with recent Onkyo hardware.  If you hook it up via HDMI, you'll get the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams from BluRay, where optical can only do Dolby Digital / DTS.
Your name obviously doesn't suite you that well.
This is the smallest size, too. I'm around 5'7", 140lbs. I don't know if it's just meant to be big or if it's made for really tall people haha
Is that necessarily true? I mean i could flip a coin for eternity and only get heads, even if its equally likely to get tails. It doesn't mean I HAVE to get tails.  But mmmmm emma watson :3
Because people want to "beat" the AI, it is rewarding to know you outsmarted them. If they then will just counter your trick then you can't ever say that you've beat it.

I accidentally installed MBAM in German once, and it was kind of neat to go through it without being able to read anything. I kind of had all of the buttons and everything memorized though.
I pissed in the same urinal as you!!

happy new year [](/sad) 
Glad you got out man. Be careful out there. Take care :)
Ah! Petland and others of their ilk always end up luring me inside as well, despite my better judgement.  When I was quite young, I had farmer neighbors up the road who kept a handful of rabbits in hutches. Once, they took them out of the hutches one by one and let me hold and pet them. Fortunately I was too young then to comprehend their eventual fate, or I might have led a lapine insurrection.  When I was about twelve, I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale, including this huge specimen for $50, probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla, in retrospect, though specific details of appearance escape me. Anyway, I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance, but she refused... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it.  Glad to hear that you keep multiple rabbits; given the social nature of most varieties (and their relatively short history of domestication as house pets) they are certainly far happier for the company than they would be alone.
This whole cop out that it does not apply to American citizens is SUCH bullshit...  Why are non-Americans some form of subhuman that only deserves 3/5ths of the rights as an American.?  The right to due process is an inalienable right which EVERYONE has...  It's ONLY the right to confront your accuser.  It's NOT a get out of jail free card.  Adolf Hitler, Osama Bin Ladin ... military combatants, etc. I don't give a SHIT who this is... they all deserve the right to a trial.  NOT because I give a SHIT about their rights, but because the rights of the innocent people swept up in some bullshit charge MUST be protected.  Further, say you ARE an american citizen and you did something foolish like date a girl who's father is a Muslim fanatic... and the Gov things you're involved... and you ARE an American citizen.  They'll just disappear your ass and say they don't have you.  That the only people they have in custody are enemy combatants.  And because there is NO due process/habeas corpus, the lawyer can't bring these non-persons in front of a judge to prove the state wrong.  Fuck Obama... this is fucking WWII Nazi shit...  I gave him the maximum campaign contribution in 2008... he's not getting SHIT from me in 2012.
Hmm, not sure how this game escaped my radar, but I had never even heard of it before today. And already 3-4 people have suggested it to me.   Maybe because I specified L4D?
Thanks for the piece of coal!
Gotta cup 'em all, PokeBra!
Most people don't. I suppose that it's both a blessing (as PC titles and hardware go for cheaper) and a curse (as it tends to be less well-kept and in worse condition).
toutch grind and toutch grind bmx!!!!!! literally spent hours playing them
big bird isn't a pervert.
The 80's called, they want their you back.
The reason I say this is because the hardware survey apparently analyzes the computer that is to be used so if I do the survey it might not let your friend use it.
I had this same thought.  I imagine it went something like (in their heads):  -Guy in bandages waves gun around.  -At some point, the "hero" splinter cell protagonist comes in and subdues him or something.  -Everyone is happy the day is saved, and wants to be the one saving the day so buys their video game.
