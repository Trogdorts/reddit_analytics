It's okay! The only way we can find out the answer to something is asking a question. I'm glad to reciprocate!
It because when you first start playing your main objective is just to survive. You dont have to worry about building well or shooting well. When i first played i literally crouched and hid and it was soo intense and fun. Then as that novelty wears off you bing trying to shoot build and play for more kills 
So cute! Don't forget her tiny booties for her tiny feets!

Sketched in graphic editor, used modelling clay to get rough feel of its dimensions, then just modelling in CAD manually. If you scan, you'll still have to model it cleanly, using the scan as a reference. That's actually what Logitech did with at least 1 of their mice (MX Master). [The vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRpHwtckYZw).  Actually one of the hardest parts is to find out precise PCB mounting holes positions. Good thing though, once measured properly, data can be shared.

It doesn‚Äôt mention ‚Äúdamage equal to‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt have to. It is fairly clear that you can‚Äôt add the same modifier twice to any roll, so whether it is damage or an attack roll or even a static thing like AC, it doesn‚Äôt work. The Paladin example even makes it clear that such language is the same as just adding the modifier.  Now your point about the different triggers is much more valid, and so they might stack because of that. Especially since now that I look at them more closely, one is untyped and one is bludgeoning. Hmm well it would depend on the gm but there is a much better possibility.

Like me, you can deactivate facebook to remove the temptation to revisit and just keep messenger for those contacts (you can even still add new people from just messenger)  If I had not deactivated my muscle memory would've brought me back, I can't count the amount of times in the first month where I impulsively hit the blue FB icon after unlocking my phone without even thinking.

Liam 
For all the bleeding hearts out there. First off, this is the first window I can remember anyone even being in for him. Second, he‚Äôs signed through 2022? Third, yes I understand he would like a chance to play CL football and I hope he does. HOWEVER. We thankfully have Brands who isn‚Äôt going to sell a player 5 minutes after the first interested team comes in, in the middle of the season mind you.   I understand he wants to go. And he probably will, this summer. Players sign these guaranteed contracts and, as we have seen with about half our shit fucking payroll currently, still get paid regardless of their form. So, is it fair to the team to expect them to pay the shit players and let the good ones go as soon as a better prom date comes along? No.  1) give us a real bid 2) give us more than 5 minutes to replace him  Those are the 2 criteria and we currently have none of them met.  If he‚Äôs that valuable now he‚Äôll be that valuable in the summer. It‚Äôs 6 months.   In Brands I trust 
Yeah, there's really no young talent in the East that isn't already on a competitive team. The middle and bottom are going to be bad for a while.

I completely agree with this! I do this, too. It works nice on some things. OP's bracelets would be perfect.  If I have something that can't be sold for around $15, then I add a bunch together. After fees and the time used to process the sale, I need to see a good profit.

It's so ridiculously cold (and made worse with windchill).

This is an outright lie. Please, show me where someone said they want to merge the city schools with the county schools and I'll eat my sock. The Better Together plan certainly doesn't say that.

Send them back to the classroom and replace them with administrators from the county. It'd be great for the district.

I was numb for ... I‚Äôd say months after. I felt like an orphan. But you learn how strong you are. You remember that you‚Äôve sort of always been alone ... now you‚Äôre also free.  Good luck. 
I can't speak for everyone, or say what the online crowds would do.   But I'm a person who opposes Howard Schultz as president, because he has no experience running a political office. I would also oppose Oprah. So it's not true that *all* the same people who oppose Schultz would support Oprah.

NTA   I would‚Äôve done the same thing. Who cares, they should‚Äôve been a little more considerate of the people on the sidewalk and put up signs or held them or even asked people to over or wait until filming was done. If they want to be rude, fuck em. If they aren‚Äôt going to give you some sort of sign other than a rude gesture, why should you follow their ‚Äúrules‚Äù If they are too worried about people ruining their production, hire some cops or some sort of security or rent the spot, i don‚Äôt know how it works.  Who cares, why should you inconvenience yourself because they want to be rude.
This is the correct answer.  Can't be bothered by spice 70 beers deep.

Car registers pedestrian waiting at cross walk: proceed if there is enough time to stop, slow down if not. Cars that don't see pedestrian still see cars around them. Car in front slows: following car also slow down ... proceed down the line. The fun part is that because these are computers, they can detect the smallest difference in speed in a very small fraction of a second and react really quickly that it will all look like they all just stopped at the same time.   It's basically just like humans driving but with very high reaction time and consistency that it looks like they're all moving in unison.

It‚Äôs fine if you have concerns about what the game will be at launch, and it‚Äôs totally understandable that people are expecting the worst from EA. What isn‚Äôt okay is that a lot of the community is behaving like the game has already launched, won‚Äôt have demo bugs resolved, has $100 skins, and will molest your grandmother every time you turn the game on. So much negative PR has been generated already and it‚Äôs entirely possible that BioWare will try to do right by us and the game will fail anyway because YouTubers told everyone not to buy it. We‚Äôre never going to get a solid game if people rage before they know anything concrete about the final product.  These reviewers should be waiting until launch before rallying their audience to hate the game, and the community needs to stop preorders before launch and wait for actual fact based reviews are out. Frankly I am fucking sick of the victim complex from people that can‚Äôt control themselves with preorders and then whine about being duped. All of the Reddit threads in the world won‚Äôt have the same impact as not buying the game if it employs predatory practices or buying it only when you know it‚Äôs a solid game.

&gt; "parem, parem, Kaitsev√§es on parem" -&gt; "right, right, the military is right"   I'd specify that this is more accurately a play on words, as *parem* can mean both 'right' and 'better'. So while a regular march is left, left, left right left, then this one, starting off on the opposite right, and playing on the aforementioned dual meaning of the word *parem*, concludes 'it's better in the EDF [military]'.

Good to know! 'Course, there's a time when you want reputation (that time being when you want to paint for money), but when there's no reason to have it, it's still best to not have it.

How is there an all loving God who‚Äôs ready to condemn non-believers to hell for their so called ignorance? Think about it like this.

Eh, it's got some of what made Futurama great, but so do a lot of shows. Final space feels like Futurama and Adventure time mixed together.

Venmo is owned by Paypal and they suspend payments to accounts all the time.  Once word would get out about what the funds are for they would more than likely suspend the receiving account.

Those are very real feelings, but in other countries they don't just pump people full of drugs. eg in Finland they started an open-dialogue approach (which doesn't use any drugs) which has almost eliminated "schizophrenia" among people using this approach:  **Robert Whitaker:**  (Harvard Medical School director of publications.)  - "They're down to 2 cases per 100,000.  A 90% decline in schizophrenia.  Their first episode cases aren't chronic."   -- https://youtu.be/aBjIvnRFja4?t=102  And in Europe there's a therapy (without drugs) where 80% of people called "schizophrenic" recover as long as those people have resources,  but if they're drugged (without therapy and help) the recovery rate drops to 5%.:  -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts17LI77BUo   &gt; they told us they didn't think they could restrain themselves from the thoughts they were having about hurting family members.   There's polling showing that people who hear voices are far more common then people realize, but most of them don't say anything because 1) the voices aren't negative but in fact fairly positive, and 2) they don't want to get labelled 'schizophrenic.'  Of people who report really negative voices they have often gone through some trauma, especially childhood trauma:  **Trauma:**  - ‚ÄúThe findings are consistent with the thesis that trauma could have a causal association with psychotic experiences,‚Äù the team of researchers, from the University of Bristol Medical School wrote."  -- https://www.madinamerica.com/2018/11/researchers-suggest-traumatic-experience-may-cause-psychotic-symptoms/  - "Eighty-three percent of the participants with psychotic experiences at the age of 18 reported exposure to trauma...   Having experienced three or more types of trauma between birth and 17 was associated with a 4.7 fold increase in the odds of having a psychotic experience"  -- Same URL

The no break room or coffee thing is just how they found out, thats what he said he was doing when it got out and killed everyone in the lab but they called him out because that lab didn't have those things.   As for him destroying it I think they just tasked him with it for two reasons:  1. He's the scientist who knows the creature best. 2. He was willing to do terrible things just to expose the threat it presents, which likely means he'd be willing to do even more terrible things to make sure it's destroyed.

If you want an *actual* dmr I go along with balhacks‚Äô dmr rules. Where any gun that shoots 7.62 nato or higher. For example, a m4 with a long barrel isn‚Äôt a dmr. Same with aks. They‚Äôre chambered in 7.62 yes, but 7.62x39 not 7.62 nato which is 7.62x51 so guns like g3s,417s,ar10s,dragonovs etc. etc. are all good also big bois like good ol m82s although classified as ‚Äúanti material‚Äù are also ok.  So tell me what guns you‚Äôre thinking about and I‚Äôll see if I can help.

It's a massive invasion of privacy, targeting the innocent as well if the guilty. The tech is only in its infancy and already had huge potential to be misused and abused. Cambridge analytica had already shown the potential.  People who do not recognise the threat do not understand the danger, but I wonder if those people would be happy with the police having the freedom to listen to all phonecalls regardless of someone's criminal associations, or to have the police observing all citizens under constant 24hour surveillance allowing them to identify potential rogue elements. This is what these technologies are capable of doing, but it  even more powerful because the meta data can be used to analyse crowd behaviour on a high level, sorting and matching huge quantities of data to recognise human behaviours.   This is not even the thin end of the wedge is about 1/2 down, and I wasn't aware that a Stazsi state is what we wanted.

The haptic feedback motors use barely any power to operate, and while attached to the switch the joycons dont comunicate via bluetooth. You can put it in airplane mode without allowing bluetooth controllers and they will work fine while attached.  The problem is the increased voltage required to run the GPU at 768mhz instead of 307mhz. Thats where your power draw jumps exponentially.
This make a lot more sense. Thanks!

Interesting. A lot of this seems like basic functionality/quality of life features that *should* be included at launch. Specifically:  * Photo mode - other games have implemented this after the fact, why not just go right for it at launch * 'Emblems for Javelins - I don't personally care about this that much but why not? * 'Carry progress between platforms - How come Fortnite's model hasn't taken off yet? * 'Any crazy sci-fi/alien weapons -  Why isn't this a no brainer‚Äîa game like this needs a robust arsenal to give you a feeling of truly unique/customized gameplay. The weapons they have shown are very cool, but there definitely needs to be some real attention paid to legendary/exotic type weapons that defy Anthem's universes conventional. * 'Anywhere we can see total values of stats -?????!!!! * 'DPS meter - QoL, heck yeah. * 'Re-rolling stats on gear - The idea that this isn't available on launch is frankly startling. Makes me worry that gunplay will get real stale real quick. * 'Inspect player menu - isn't this basic? * 'UI indication of carry important items, e.g quest items - and this? * 'Customize thruster color - and this? * 'Customize Javelin lights - and this too? * 'Customizing element color, e.g blue fire, red ice - I don't understand why customizing your character beyond vinyls is a maybe. * 'FOV slider for console - still surprised by this. * 'Teammate ultimate indicator - ??? * 'Bows? like Robin Hood style - I think this is bundled with the crazy sci fi weapon one really. They haven't really discussed weaponry to the level of detail that I'd expect for a new looter shooter.

&gt; Broadly speaking I would say just because things like meaning and morality are imaginary/subjective (exist dependent on a mind), that doesn't mean they don't exist (because they clearly exist in the mind). It just means there isn't some objective/real (existing independent of the mind) source for those concepts. Unlike something like gravity which does appear to be objective and real.  I followed you till you asserted gravity is real - what do you mean? There is a thing that we generally experience that pulls stuff towards other stuff? Ok, that's probably real, every experiment done so far suggests that it is and that might be enough to go on.   On the other hand, gravity is also a kind of meaning we put on our experience. We feel/observe things pulling together, we call it gravity. In that sense, it's subjective, and although you can make noises (ie talk) and draw images (ie write) to communicate your experience of it to me, how the hell do I know... and so I slip into solipsism.  I want out of it! The answer can't just be, there is no answer, forgetabout it, because that like saying, god is, and you can't understand him - that is, it's lazy and unsatisfying... But I don't know the answer.

Neither is correct. Whenever you see an umlaut/diaeresis above a vowel in a sequence of two vowels next to each other, it means you're supposed to pronounce the vowels as separate syllables (the reverse is true as well; if neither of the vowels in a sequence of two vowels has an umlaut/diaeresis, you're supposed to pronounce the vowels together in a single syllable). Thus *F√´anor* is pronounced ***feh-ah-nor*** (**[Ààf…õ.an…îr]** in IPA, not [Ààfe…™.an…îr]).  Edit: For context, just listen to [Tolkien reciting the *Nam√°ri√´* poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6de_SbVUVfA). And here's [another recording of Tolkien reciting the *Nam√°ri√´*] (https://www.jrrvf.com/glaemscrafu/audio/tolkien/mp3/namarie.mp3), except much slower and clearer. You'll notice that all instances of **√´** are pronounced as […õ], not [e…™] and pronounced distinctly separate from any vowels next to it (most notably in the case of the word *Oioloss****√´o***).  And for more context, Tolkien states that it's usually ***√©*** and ***√≥*** that are pronounced in the typical English manner, but is also regarded as incorrect pronunciations in-universe:  &gt;A fairly widespread pronunciation of long *√©* and *√≥* as *ei* and *ou*, more or less as in English *say no*, both in Westron and in the rendering of Quenya names by Westron speakers, is shown by spellings such as *ei*, *ou* (or their equivalents in the contemporary scripts). But such pronunciations were regarded as incorrect or rustic. They were naturally usual in the Shire. Those therefore who pronounce *y√©ni √∫n√≥time* 'long-years innumerable', as is natural in English (sc. more or less as *yainy oonoatimy)* will err little more than Bilbo, Meriadoc, or Peregrin. Frodo is said to have shown great 'skill with foreign sounds'.   And for even more reference, here are how all the vowels in Quenya are pronounced:  Vowel | IPA :-: | :-: √° | [a:] √© |[e:] √≠ | [i:] √≥ | [o:] √∫ | [u:] a | [a] e | […õ] i | [i] o | […î] u | [u]

That's going to be really hard for anyone in THIS sub to answer, as almost all of us are British people or foreign residents who have good English.  I dunno if there is an EFL sub or something you can ask.  You might get lucky and find there are some EFL teachers in here though.

It seems like if you don't get into too much trouble right into adulthood you could get a few entry-level credit cards, which would render payday loan useless. Even subprimes with 29.99% APR are better than payday loans, for the which the math at current allowable  rates just doesn't work.

Are there any books out on this exam yet? Would love to buy Mike Meyers book, but Amazon says not until April. Would be happy to buy a digital copy + a preorder, but I don‚Äôt see a site dedicated to Mike, unless the totalsem site is his and a digital copy simply isn‚Äôt an option yet. In any case; any good reading materials yet, aside from just Googling the items on the exam objectives? Thanks!

Why do you assume that "leaders" are going to be doing things that their employees would want to make public?   If you make carefully considered, rational decisions, then your staff generally won't have any interest in undermining you even if they may not agree with your decision.  When you make indefensible decisions that put your staff in a position where they are expected to do things against their moral code, then they are likely to feel compelled to leak information.  Sure, you need to keep people in line, but that should be done by acting in a way that garners their respect - not through trying to force them into compliance.
All I got from that is..  Hey, you know we should do? While your body is being slowly destroyed by manual labour, damaged by the sun's rays, injured in various accidents to the point that you moan in pain during the nights, we should go ahead and have 2 kids.  Kids ain't everything yo. What's a couple of years to get your shit together before having kids. Dude's gonna be working like this til retirement now.

Reddit (for the most part) can be fun, awesome and friendly, but sometimes that might not be the case. Depending on the situation and subreddit you're on or your comment. It's also crazy how this website is active no matter the time or day because everyone's from around the globe!   If you are just as equally respectful as others and are just happily conversating or contributing to others communities, then you'll be good!   There's almost *any* sub for anything you have in mind, it's almost kinda unsettling. But Welcome to Reddit!
this isnt fake.  its not a "baby" thats actually a four year old kid with a growth hormone problem. they appear to be much younger than they are. its much like the disease that causes rapid aging in kids. i know this because i worked as an orderly in a children's hospital and saw lots of these kids. they typically have problems with motor skills and go through a ton of physical therapy usually through art. the have extreme problems with controlling theyre digits.(fingers, toes) so balancing and things like handwriting are challenging. the way she is holding that pen is exactly how they teach them to do it. hopefully so they learn to adapt to other activity's as needed. not trying to be a dick btw its the type of thing you wouldnt notice in a child unless you sat down to dinner with one and watched them use silver ware.

Agreed. It makes no sense.  Say what you want about the Crystals, but at least they gave you credit in regards to how loyal you are when it comes to playing the game. Limiting what said credit can be used on doesn't just devaluate the in-game currency, it makes people less interested in playing it in general.  If the Bonus Crystals essentially become worthless, fewer people will keep logging in every day to get them. And if they're not logging in as often, they're probably not playing as often, and chances are that they'll also become less and less interested in the game itself, which will lead to a decrease in the number of purchases as well.  One doesn't need to be a rocket scientist in order to see that.

I think that words have meaning and enslave =/= imprison. I think that a government imprisoning people for crimes =/= you having a constitutional right to own people.

I was...28. I think. If I can do math correctly. And I was there til I had a good seizure. Not just any old seizure, a good one. When they pulled me off my last med, I had a tonic clonic seizure and that was just not good enough, because I don't normally have those. They wanted to capture a few normal ones before they let me go. I was going absolutely stir crazy.

Hey buddy, I haven‚Äôt been here for long, but I detect a little discordance here....
If Tom Scott had bothered to actually compare plugs and do some research about why UK plugs are designed that way, he would have known he‚Äôs talking rubbish.  UK plugs are this way because UK houses have ring circuits, which don‚Äôt provide the safety of the radial circuits used everywhere else in the world. So to get on the same safety level that circuits in continental europe inherently have, the plugs need these extra features that perform the tasks done by circuit breakers and proper wiring in continental Europe.

I'll be honest, I skipped smokes out of laziness while we were learning the rules.  I'd never used them in oldcromunda.  Seems like I did myself a disservice.  First 2 games went well, but then things took a turn to the south after my opponent got to trash my gang in an ambush mission.  I spent the next 3 missions getting deleted by bolters.  I'll be better prepped for our next weekend campaign.

From the photo posted earlier, it looks like you want to sing and play guitar at the same time.  Unless you have a very loud (I mean really loud) voice, it would be a better balance to use a condenser mic on both vocals and guitar. To help get the best sound on each source, you want to avoid bleed - e.g. vocal on the guitar mic, guitar on the vocal mic.  I'd recommend the following:  Use a small diaphragm (tighter pickup pattern) condenser mic on the guitar, line the AT Pro 37 for @$170.  https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Pro37--audio-technica-pro-37-small-diaphragm-condenser-microphone  Use a large diaphragm condenser on your voice, they will pick up more detail and you'll sound better.  Use one that is multipattern and set it to bi-directional, and point it so that it faces your mouth, and at the same time the side of the mic is facing the guitar (for best off axis rejection.  https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MK300--miktek-mk300-large-diaphragm-condenser-microphone.  The Scarlett interface should work fine.  Just remember to use 48V phantom power.

A lot of these comments are just generally good frames, but in terms of specifically frames that can do all relevant tasks superbly well in fortuna and cetus with great survivability and damage, it has to be Octavia.

Are you suggesting that Spanish hasn't split into multiple, mutually-unintelligible languages, but that it would have were it not for the RAE?
I guess I have a slightly different view point. No I don't agree with the whole "it's his house" thing and I never say it for my pets. Buuut, it *is* your friends house. His house, his rules. If he doesn't want to put his ugly nasty mutt outside, well, that's his right.  BUT, you are not obligated to be in his house and subject to the whims of a nasty little mutant rodent. The first time your friend told you he wasn't going to put the dog outside, was the last you should've asked. You should have simply stood up and calmly stated you were leaving because the dog was being very intrusive and irritating and you don't want to put up with it.  That speaks louder to dog people than swearing at them. Calmly asserting you will not tolerate their animal and they will find themselves isolated because of it. Your friend has a right to do as he pleases on his property. But if you don't like the way he runs his house, then you don't need to go over. If he wants to choose a gross little chihuahua over your friendship then good riddance to bad rubbish. I am not friends with people who prefer their animals over me.

Yo man, I've been battling my own shit for a while now too but suicide isn't an answer. Suicide passes the same pain you feel to the people who care for you. You may not know these people and they may not know you, but a lot of people will feel pain. Suicide is selfish and honestly a dick thing to do. So don't do it, ya hear? Find people to help you and get therapy, please. It isn't too late. It's never too late. You're a beautiful dude and you have a place in this world, you just have to find it. If you don't think you're good at anything, search for something or just practice one thing you enjoy until you are good at and continue to practice it. Maybe you are good at something but you don't like what you're good at. In that case, do the same thing I just said. You can get past this. I believe in you. &lt;3
Unfortunately for me, I did that. I never received the email code. /:
I don't really see how gender criticism and asexuality connects. I'm part of both groups and I was never confused about my sexuality, it's just men are not my type and neither are women. Asexuality is simply about not feeling sexual attraction towards anyone. It's not harmful, but I'm sure if I tried to force myself to become straight it would have a quite harmful effect on me.  I agree that there are a lot of young women who only use the asexuality label because they are too afraid in this oversexualised world and I do understand it. It can be an easy escape from this porn and sex obsessed world. So many girls (mostly young teenagers) say that they are asexual because they don't agree with the hook-up culture or they actually want an emotional connection before a physical one or they are just sick of how sexualized they are by the media nowadays. They completely refuse to acknowledge their sexuality instead of learning about it. Being this completely "innocent" asexual person and not giving a crap about all that sexual stuff you hear and experience can be a liberating feeling but it is a lie. Being asexual cannot save you from the world and seeing how oversexualised everything is is just depressing and traumatising because you don't get this whole thing.  I know that it sounds like gatekeeping but real asexuals do exist, but I think before someone identifies with it they should really examine the underlying reasons why they believe they are one. I feel like people throw around the asexual label too easily. Just because it didn't fit you it doesn't mean it's a lie.   I'm curious what you think about it.

I have always had trouble understanding the logic of point #3...  Jesus directly said to his disciples that he would die and resurrect... so we could argue that that's were they came to  accept the resurrection even though Jewish belief went against it.   It still makes little sense why they would claim they saw him alive afterwards. If Jesus didn't resurrect on the third day, then their beliefs would be false by their own measure, and they would likely just distance themselves from the whole thing...

&gt;They also have MTX with 20$ single skins.  This based off of speculation from a screenshot that had no real money conversions, and the poster just assumed it. Quite literally unfounded. This thread does a good job of [debunking this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/ajkhk0/spoilers_lets_have_an_adult_conversation_about/). I hate it when people call fake news on shit they don't like, but this is actually fake news. While it could be something that happens, bioware, the actual devs, have repeatedly said is not decided. They've talked several times about their design choices around this, and that the underpinning philosophy from bioware is that you shouldn't miss out because you aren't spending money. Feel free to check twitter accounts, as a few different bioware leads have talked about this. That being said, at this point the only real facts we have is that it's unknown.  &gt; It's so sad to see how many people are missing Warframe  I'm not playing this or that in leau of another game. I can play both. I like warframe, and I enjoyed what I played of Anthem. Moreover, many people will play both. Waframe costs me, in principle, nothing to play. And guess what? If someone plays anthem, and it flops, but they like the idea, they'll likely get directed to Waframe. This isn't a zero-sum game.  &gt; they're praising Anthem for things Warframe have for eternity  They can have similar features. They straddle similar genres, and it doesn't take from either to use good ideas both have. No one would get anywhere if every idea had to be wholly unique. Just like Anthem has some features warframe has, warframe could learn a thing or two from anthem too. The priming system is fun, flight feels excellent in anthem. Anthem could really use some of warframe's speed in movement.  Just because someone likes something else doesn't mean you need to shit on it.

*countercurrent flow  And the way it works is different than stated. Its purpose is to conserve core body heat and the way this is achieved is by the artery and vein in the limb running together, in opposite directions. By so doing maximal heat transfer is achieved from the warm artery exiting the core to the cold venous return *before* the arterial blood reaches the cold distal limb where heat would be lost from the foot into the snow. So the foot actually remains colder in order to preserve core temperature.  We see a similar principle of countercurrent flow elsewhere in biology, such as fish gills and bird lungs (part of why bird lungs are more efficient than mammals) to maximize oxygen exchange with the environment, and in the kidney both to conserve water and electrolytes in the Loop of Henle, and also in the vasa recta to regulate renal medullary pH and oxygen levels.

is that canon? I forgot 
There's so much federal power though. I don't see how you can have meaningful power if you don't exert influence into the federal game.   Unions gain power from the federal government, are you against that? Are you against social security? Are you against a federal government which has done a bang up job of taking care of our monetary supply? Are you against the overwhelming and gigantic reduction in global warfare that the US is responsible for?   It's not that I'm not critical of elements of it, but we can't have the great things without some problems. These days if we don't have a federal government, we would have insanely powerful corporate entities that would basically be their own governments and it would be so much worse than the current problems. We need to steer this boat, not just fantasize about the boat we wish we could build.  I think switching from the current welfare model to a disbursement model is the best direction we can streer the federal government in. Local areas could supplement the federal disbursement with their own solutions. I think reduction in complexity for federal systems is a good direction, and I think that when you place more resources in the hands of the people, you have small errors which individuals learn from, and not these catastrophic errors that people get angry about.  Ultimately most people don't want to think about this. We are weird. Most people want to have a good day at work, feel proud of what they did, go home and relax with their friends and family. They want simple, reliable, reasonable amounts of luxury and respite. Disbursements do that. Convincing the government that you aught to qualify for this help or that is shitty, stressful and wasteful. Making sure rock bottom is livable, and making sure everyone is handed that, and leaving everything past that up to the individuals is the least amount of federal activity that we will likely ever be able to sell. Shutting it down isn't going to happen easily.  I'm personally fine with more complicated local programs, I just don't trust the fed to come up with a good one size fits all solution.

They're perfectly viable. The specialist set particularly helps them with really cheap vehicle healing (8pt droid can recover 2 hit points). You'll want to max your Corp as rebels, probably with rebel/Z6 squads, and consider picking up Han, Leia, or both. I personally favour a single commander Leia list, but your mileage may vary. Definitely look at the specialists though. Allocating even 1 droid to each AT-RT really bumps it's chances of survival.

&gt;"Those wolves will become habituated to our way of life. When they do, they watch us, they learn from us. Eventually, they will become bold enough to attack us," he said  This really lines up with my experience of wolves.  I once had a roommate who got a half wolf-dog (even though it was illegal - I moved out before too long).  That dog was always watching and learning.  Always testing to see how much it could get away with.  It's eyes didn't look like any dog I ever saw before.  You could tell it was smart.  And today I started googling wolf attacks and all the articles I found said the same thing.  Yes, few confirmed kills.  But how many people just vanish?  How many people do they try to attack only to be repelled? Have you seen how large Grey Wolves are?  Just imagine running into one of those on the trail.  Also, other sources describe wolves in the same way, like this article:  https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/he-was-testing-humans-as-potential-prey-why-canadas-richest-uranium-mining-region-is-haunted-by-wolves  How many laws have been changed on the premise of "if we can save just one life"?  The wolf is literally an Apex predator. People will die, but how many?  Once we populate them, we can't just take that back.  *edit* Downvoted like this doesn't add to the conversation...

I think it would be fair to interject here with some scholarship into the matter. First of all, the usage of soldiers of African ancestry in the several branches of the Wehrmacht should not take away from the fact that Nazi Germany was a fanatically racist and genocidal state. There are many who uses images like these of soldiers from Free Arabian Legion to make weak arguments in favor of Nazi Germany, often portraying them as willing to fight against the 'real enemy': Communism.  Historical research tells us differently. It puts it within the context of German efforts to incite revolt in French and British colonial territories. In German Prisoner of War camps, which had hundreds of colonial soldiers from North and West Africa, Muslim soldiers were repeatedly bombarded with German propaganda. The goals were, as Dr. Raffael Scheck writes in *French Colonial Soldiers in German Captivity during World War II* (Cambridge University Press, 2014):  &gt; After the German victory in the West in 1940, the interest of Germany in winning military bases in North Africa ‚Äì for a future war with the United States ‚Äì and submarine bases in West Africa were important considerations for pro-Islamic propaganda. Hitler made the first of several unsuccessful requests for bases in French Morocco and in Dakar just three weeks after the armistice. Later on, the hope of undermining the British position in Egypt and in the Middle East became the paramount interest, as German troops were fighting in North Africa and hoping for the support of Arab nationalists. Interest in acquiring a colonial empire in West and Central Africa was also important. Although Hitler himself prioritized a colonial empire in Eastern Europe, several German agencies had detailed plans for colonial acquisitions in Africa centered on, but not limited to, the former German colonies.  In the context of the North African campaigns, it made sense therefore to recruit soldiers from the local peoples in a hope that they could be portrayed as the vanguard of a "free" North Africa (hence the name "Free Arabian Legion", free implying throwing off the yokes of colonial powers). The recruitment of soldiers from French and British colonies therefore had a pragmatic element to it. It was contradictory to Nazi German ideals and should be seen in this context.  How they were treated and seen by German soldiers is a different question altogether, and one that doesn't seem to have an easy answer. Presumably, they were treated as child-like curiosities, but I've not found much scholarship into these soldiers in particular.  With that said, we should not forget one thing: Afro-German soldiers. There has been an African presence in Germany since the 17th century (and before), and this population grew larger with the acquisition of African colonies by Imperial Germany in the late 19th century. During the Nazi period, there were several Afro-Germans who left due to the intense racism and prejudice that they experience there, despite having fought for Imperial Germany in the First World War. However, those who had been born during the late 1910s and 1920s remained and some ended up being drafted in the Wehrmacht.  Let's take the example of Hans Hauck. Hans Hauck was a young Afro-German man who had been forcibly sterilized by the Nazi regime. In 1942, Hauck was drafted in the Heer. From an interview with Hauck:  &gt; HH: I was conscripted at nineteen, like everyone else.  &gt; TC: Conscripted? What is conscripted?  &gt; HH: Conscripted. That means for the army, drafted into the army. It‚Äôs called conscription.  &gt; TC: That was at nineteen. That was two years after you were sterilized?  &gt; HH: That was two years, yeah, after I was. . . . I wasn‚Äôt quite seventeen, I was sixteen when I was sterilized. And at conscription, 1939‚Äîit‚Äôs called conscription into military service‚ÄîI was unworthy for service.  &gt; TC: ‚ÄúUnworthy‚Äù?  &gt; HH: Yes. I was allowed to work, but back then I wasn‚Äôt allowed to become a soldier. Only in the course of the war, in 1941 they got looser. And in 1942, I was called up with my own permission. It depended, I could have then said, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want me, and now I don‚Äôt want you.‚Äù But then I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here today. It‚Äôs that simple. We‚Äôve got examples of that. A mate that I was sterilized with, he never came back. He got sent to a camp. And I went because I saw it as a chance. It was the first time that I was treated the same as others. Because the other ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù German boys, my mates, my schoolmates, they were called up, too. And I wanted that, and then I was called up. And then I was quite conscious of my fate, that I had a chance, 50‚Äì50. Either I survive it, or I don‚Äôt. And I survived.  It was a pragmatic choice to draft someone like Hauck, but for Hauck, it was an opportunity like nothing before: For once, just by being drafted, he'd by treated as a German man equal to everyone else.   &gt; HH: I was drafted and became a soldier, and in 1945, I was taken prisoner. I was wounded five times. I was home twice, on leave and when I was wounded. And in ‚Äô45, in January, I was taken prisoner by the Russians.  &gt; TC: How long were you a prisoner?  &gt; HH: Until 23 April 1949. . . . I can‚Äôt really describe what it was like being a prisoner. Imprisonment isn‚Äôt easy‚Äîeveryone knew that ‚Äî But I was treated more humanely by the Russians than I ever was by my own countrymen.  &gt; TC: In what way?  &gt; HH: In what way? Because no one made a big deal about my heritage there.  &gt; TC: And the other German soldiers, did they notice this? That you were treated differently?  &gt; HH: I wasn‚Äôt treated differently.  &gt; TC: Just more humanely?  &gt; HH: I was treated just like the other Germans. Just they didn‚Äôt make any distinctions. My own Fatherland didn‚Äôt do that. It discriminated against me. Only as a soldier did it treat me as an equal.  &gt; TC: And did you have the feeling during your time as a soldier that you were really accepted?  &gt; HH: In the army, you didn‚Äôt notice any difference.  &gt; TC: In spite of your ‚Äî  &gt; HH: I made private first class after the first five months‚Äîthat means I was promoted. You didn‚Äôt notice any discrimination in the army. There were many army of officers who didn‚Äôt agree with the system and didn‚Äôt say anything. But you noticed that. In the army they didn‚Äôt discriminate against me.  As Tina M. Campt (who was in the interviewer) points out in her book *Other Germans: Black Germans and the Politics of Race, Gender, and Memory in the Third Reich* (University of Michigan Press, 2005), Hauck makes a very firm and paradoxical separation between Nazi German society (who discriminated) versus the Heer (who didn't). The reason for this is that in the Heer, he could finally claim his German masculinity through his role as a soldier. In the end, it was a question of identity. Other Afro-German soldiers were allowed to leave Soviet camps early, in Hauck's retelling. However, Hauck remained. Why? As Hauck himself explained: "But I didn‚Äôt have such a standpoint. I needed a position for myself. Not for the Russians‚Äîto get home. I needed it for myself, personally‚Äî‚Äú Who/What am I?‚Äù I never listened to [the soldiers]. I‚Äôm German and was so, contrary to what Hitler thought, or the Nazis. I‚Äôm German, even [in Russia]. I didn‚Äôt want anything more. . . . I‚Äôm not saying that those comrades who did it were wrong. They were right. They got home sooner. But they had never experienced that inner conflict like I had."  Hans Hauck was indeed German, contrary to the fact that the Nazis didn't want to see him as such, and although it's fair to say that he wasn't the only one to experience an inner conflict about identity, his paradoxical participation as a German soldier in the Eastern front needs to be considered out of his own, personal and subjective experience. The matter of black soldiers in German uniform remains, therefore, a complex question.  **EDIT:** Added the original sources of the two scholars mentioned.
The case could get thrown out, or at least some evidence excluded.  Same thing for failing to disclose evidence that may assist the defence, or withholding 'unused evidence'.  Disciplinaries sure, I'm not sure about specific prosecutions though. Severe cases would come under 'misconduct in public office', most likely.

You're not quite getting it, dude. Billy has so much more than Leatherface. You're only argument is that Leatherface is easier which isn't a great argument. It could be summed up like this:  Do you want to win? I.E. get 3 or 4 kills at rank 1.   If yes, use Billy.   If no, use Leatherface. Billy has map control, Billy can slug and take off and immediately down another nearby Survivor, Billy can stop loops, Billy can bait hook rescues, Billy can catch up to them in a flash (so long as he has the room for it), Billy can camp a hook from a distance. These are all things Leatherface lacks.

I‚Äôd like to see Laca on the wing tbh, he used to be a winger, as did Auba but I think he‚Äôd do a better job.  He‚Äôs more direct and better with the ball, Auba on the wing for us is a bit like Walcott with more presence in the box and more goals obviously. 
Women should be able to do whatever they want with their own body because their body is their property.  The unborn baby inside of them is not their property.  That body is the property of the unborn baby.  Therefore the woman does not have the right to kill the baby.  Make sense?

So in my version, Cypher made a deal with Cawl to exchange knowledge for his own Chapter of Primaris.  I haven't figured out a great name yet, but Sons of the Sword ( Lions Blade ) or something.

Do you believe God exists in a higher realm of other Gods (as I‚Äôve heard is true in a Hebrew prequel book of sorts (Enoch?))? Why is a covenant, seemingly a human concept of relation to God, important and serious to God, especially when playing the game by himself?

That‚Äôs dumb, subspecies are a thing in biology. Do you have a dog? Is it 10 lbs or 100 lbs? Is it smart or a little shit? All dogs share almost the exact same DNA, but that little bit of variability can go a long way in changing the physiology of the dog. To say that science should be race-blind is ignorant. 
This is outstanding!

I "every" get the feeling that successful people take life seriously, because they care about others, the safety of children, and want to make sure their is a world out there left for the younger generations to inherit.   Not everyone is a piece of shit republican, and not everyone is a comedian.

Thanks. Spent a lot of time on it.
Oh also another piece of advice for best fruit (large berries, good flavor): strawberries prefer a slightly acidic soil that is rich in nutrients. Before replanting in spring amend your bed with an organic fertilizer that is high in potassium, such as greensand or kelp meal. Your soil nutrients should be balanced, but if you have high nitrogen and low potassium, you‚Äôll end up with leafy foliage and not many flowers. 
Meuller Time!  That‚Äôs all I need to see.

Are they going to wear gloves during the game or try to punch UNC? Would not recommend either approach.  EDIT: Gerald Henderson Jr. tried the latter approach once and the Tar Heels fan are still a little salty about that. Maybe Hendo should have yelled out "I am a bad baaaaad man!" so they knew what was going on.
...Hold my dongle!
Honest question how was Tgohan bodied last patch with bomb buffs?
They are so far divorced from at least the American guidelines that it's hard to believe they're from the same world.   Literally the top recommendation is:  "Enjoy your meals."  They also recommend:  "Take advantage of your dietary culture and local food products, while incorporating new and different dishes."  All of this advises against food trends, and there has never been a "low fat craze" in Japan. So likewise there was never a replacement with low fat food with lots of added sugars. (Japanese people tend to eat quite little fat though, but make very little to no difference between saturated and non-saturated fat.)  Apart from that, the guidelines do not include the type of lobbying from big dairy to drink lots of milk (calcium can come from vegetables as is guided here), however they do have some things from big rice, which is questionable.  And above all fruit is really not a mainstay of the diet, but is seen as candy, which you also get out of the guidelines.

Gains and Losses are amplified, you can Google "Why leveraged index funds aren't for long term".  Think about it with simple math: 10% of $100 invested is 110. But if you lose 10%, you're down to $90 and it takes **more** than 10% to get back to $100. With heavy swings, your portfolio could easily lose 1/3 of your value quickly.
It's not a hard concept, but there are folks who're too selfish to *want* to learn.

&gt;‚ÄúI did" talk to them, he said, "and they said that they were totally misquoted, and they were totally -- it was taken out of context. I‚Äôd suggest that you call them. They said it was fake news.‚Äù  &gt;The problem with this is that these officials gave their remarks in public testimony, not behind closed doors -- as is often the case with briefings about intelligence matters. **What they said clearly contradicted to what Trump has said** about the state of affairs with regard to Iran, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and North Korea, and Trump responded in kind on Thursday.  ...  &gt;The episode has plenty of precedent for Trump. Trump has claimed that he never said Mexico would cut a check for the border wall, but he has. He has claimed he didn‚Äôt say many other things for which there is video.  &gt;And these officials have disagreed with Trump many times before, most notably on Russian interference in the 2016 election and the killing of Washington Post Global Opinions columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The idea that they disagree is hardly revolutionary. In fact, it‚Äôs pretty par-for-course.

Great, thank you for the insight. I dont want to interrupt anyone's game especially if this isnt a common thing.
Oh no that‚Äôs terrible! I feel like this is a definite danger of having children.
I wish people would stop throwing around the phrase "generational talent" on guys who've never made it past the divisional round of the playoffs.
I posted the comment minutes after the news came out. If only there was a an organ in your head you could use. 
Of course it's legal. There's probably not even any laws governing ownership rights of digital games yet. In fact you don't buy the game, you just buy a license to play the game.

Wonder why... 
If you're american, there's no reason to not block OFAC country list. You're just never going to do business with them, and none of them are exactly top tier travel destinations for your remote workers.  That being said you do need to be a bit careful and make sure your users are aware which ones you are blocking.  For instance, CDW blocks Japan outright. Kind of annoying when I travel there since I work with CDW in america.
YES!!!

The only reason I bought Nvidia originally was because of hack compatibility. Now that it's such a dreadful state, I don't know how I can purchase another Nvidia card in my right mind.

What did labour think would happen when they tightened the noose around landlords necks? Of course they‚Äôre all going to jump ship? Why are you guys surprised?
Quantum Time Lock. It deletes the timeline if humanity has either no room left to grow or strays too far from "correct" history. By becoming immortal, humans would lose a lot of what makes them fundamentally human, as the desire to survive is what creates evolutionary traits -- and therefore humans -- in the first place.

If it's a corporate check, there's usually fine print on it that says it's not valid after X days.   Otherwise, if the company or person issuing the check hasn't processed a stop payment on it, you should be able to cash it.  Best way is to just take it to the bank to find out.
hm, strange. works on my end.
Yes, it‚Äôs pretty nice since many museums are free tht night and it‚Äôs good to see people going to them. Every museum is full that night.

Cool idea. I'm like in 1:19s in Melbourne TT so this wouldn't be challenging at all for me xD. Well, you seem to be having fun with it and you will also get faster with time. I just can't wait to get myself a wheel because I play with an old ass, worn out xbox 360 wired controller on PC using only lines in corners.

Capitalism is better than socialism. It simply performs better because private rights cost less than public rights. That's it. We have continuous studies to show how effective private rights are versus economic regulation as well. At this point it's just anti-scientific to be socialist teebeeache.

Have you read the thread?  &gt;In the majority of places public urination doesn't require you to register as a sex offender, indecent exposure does though. It's really rare for someone who truly just had to piss to actually be charged and convicted of indecent exposure instead of or in addition to public urination. Not saying it's never happened (which is bad) but it's definitely not as common as you would think for how often it's brought up in these situations. Lots of times weirdos jerking it in public will claim they were "just peeing" when they weren't.  https://old.reddit.com/r/trashy/comments/alrtvg/dont_judge_too_quickly/efgr08n/
There's so much talk about how he only has right wing trolls on but one of the most leftist people I know pointed out he had Tulsi Gabbard on who is rather left wing on many issues. Granted that's one against several but still I think people just forget/don't notice/want to circle jerk about Joe being super right wing which doesn't really bear out if you actually listen to a lot of what he says and understand that depending on the guest he will change what he says (which to me does seem like a good interviewing technique at least).

You like a cock between your tits? Yeah? Well I want my cock back in your mouth  Edit: hahaha holy fuck I meant to send that to my fwb but some tf how posted this herelmao.i was trying to copy and paste some funny old line and shit got mixed up I assume. I admit that I am just a tad high this evening.  I guess it's the result of a combination of 65 mg oxycodone, 350 mg of Soma (underated muscle relaxevr, makes you feel like jell-o), a tiny .25 mg bit of a xan, and a modest packed bowl of my all-time favorite strain, northern lights (indicas can often times compliment opioids very well), and going back and forth with a beautiful woman via snapchat on this fine evening.  Wow, I know that was a whole lot but I am just in a great mood and in my bag rn and this little mistake just made me laugh so I'm keeping it here. Anyone else in this sub dabble with psychoactive drugs from time to time?

The easiest way to get rid of the ads without paying is put it on airplane mode and wait a few days for the ads to age off.   You can use the My Content and Devices page on your Amazon account to download your kindle books to your computer and side load the to your kindle via USB and never / rarely connect via wifi again.  I found the ads didn‚Äôt bother me much because they aren‚Äôt on the pages of the books I read, and I leave my kindle in airplane mode for weeks at a time to save battery anyway.  ETA if you purchased the kindle without special offers Amazon should remove them for free. I would certainly pursue that with their customer support.

Marie kondo is this Japanese woman who is the author of a book called:‚Äù the life changing magic of tidying up‚Äù.  The book is for those who are stressed out over having a messy house or feel too lazy to clean or don‚Äôt know how to tidy up in an effective manner.   Her book though is more philosophical and somewhat spiritual and goes past just cleaning. She talks about how when you keep a place clean it also can help you organize your life as a whole, and makes you feel much better. She has a famous quote that says: if you pick something up and it doesn‚Äôt spark joy then you should throw it out. This can be applied to more than just cleaning your house.   It‚Äôs a very wholesome book and has helped many people in different ways. She has a netflix show too called: tidying up with marie kondo. Where she teaches other families whose houses are in disorder her personal methods and thoughts about cleaning up. One interesting aspect is that she doesn‚Äôt judge someone for what sparks them joy and decide to keep. She also helps the family work together as a family too.  It‚Äôs a heartwarming show.

The hinges are called barrel hinges.  When I used them, I aligned them by making a center depression on the base where the hinge would go. I placed a BB (small metal ball) in the depression and taped it down. Then aligned the lid on top so it was even all the way around, then pressed down hard to leave a depression on the lid.  I now had 4 points to center the drill bit for perfectly aligned hinges.  Here's a harmonica box I made using the barrel hinges:   http://imgur.com/a/AvxZT

It's ACTUALLY THE **EXACT** OPPOSITE!  Foot binding was a method of forced mutilation that MADE ONE DELIBERATELY LESS MOBILE, LESS INDEPENDENT AND LESS AUTONOMOUS!  **FORCED**  **IT FUCKING DISABLED THEM**  **IT WAS A WAY TO SUPPRESS THEIR FREEDOM** ..  Advocating obesity means you are telling women, in our modern times, that they have no choice.  That this is beautiful.  That they should be embracing a lifestyle that restricts their options, that debilitates them and puts limits on their mobility.  One that puts them in CONSTANT DISCOMFORT and frequent exhaustion when they perform moderate physical acts.  That the possibility of being unnecessarily bedbound and completely dependent is okay   You are telling them to die much much younger than they should.  And on top of that, that way of life (what time they have) is no way to live. The quality of life one has can not be ignored.  I am so infuriated.

Respectfully disagree. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm a Kiwi and we have a super high rate of melanoma (which is caused by over exposure to UV rays 90% of the time).  But.   No current research suggests sunscreen is dangerous. And yes they‚Äôve studied it more than you‚Äôd think. [One such source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0781.2011.00557.x) And using SPF 30 has been shown to reduce melanomas by 50-75% (depending on which study you read). [Great clinical study ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21135266)   Getting enough vitamin D can be safely and cheaply done through food and dietary supplements. Without the risks associated with overexposure to UV radiation.   TLDR: Giant fiery ball vs. our weak skin=giant fire ball winning. üòÇ

Holy shit thats funny
In the beginning it was just will power. I hate getting up early but decided to go to the gym at 6:30 each morning. I work from home so I could easily sleep til 7:45, roll out of bed, and walk to the desk. It was tough the first couple weeks. But after that it became routine and I love my 6:30 class so that‚Äôs a great motivator. Somethings that helped:  - Get my clothes out and ready to go before I go to bed  - Set a back up alarm 5 mins after the first alarm so I don‚Äôt turn the first one off and go back to sleep  - Remind myself that if I just get out of bed, I‚Äôll be more awake and less mad about waking up at 5:40 - Remind myself how much better my day is when I workout in the morning  - Turn on the bed side lamp when the second alarm goes off. This also triggers my dog to jump on the bed and come cuddle with me/ lick my face which definitely wakes me up  - If I do consider going back to sleep, I‚Äôll remind myself that there‚Äôs people who have had less sleep than me that got up earlier than me and already did their workout for the day. And I need to quit being lazy or else I‚Äôll be fat forever. A little self-neging does help lol.   I‚Äôm 5 months into my routine at this point and it really has gotten easier. That first alarm still sucks majorly but I don‚Äôt want to miss my gym time so I don‚Äôt have much trouble getting up anymore.

Like I actually stumbled upon this and love to weigh in.  I don't want to seem combative but I will go point-by-point on it because that's the easiest way for me to participate in discussions:  \-He is the best fighter  While not an unfair assumption to make, it's not accurate. In Salvatore's own writing (I assume by first six novels you mean chronologically because icr the publication order) Drizzt isn't necessarily unchangeable. He never truly bests Zaknafein, dead or alive, and Artemis Entreri is only bested by luck or a sliver of skill difference. And if we want to talk about pound for pound a human in his 20s (early 30s?) being able to keep up with an elf who has had decades (centuries in original writings because Drizzt didn't have an established date of birth yet and was said to be around 140, but was later retconned with Salvator's weird interpretation of elven aging) of experience and training more than him is WAY impressive.  I know the title says only the first six books, but Drizzt is REPEATEDLY engaged in duels that challenge him throughout the series after Icewind Dale, and if you want to go external of the writings to the rest of the FR, Gareth Dragonsbane exists who is likely a better swordsman than even Zak during AD&amp;D, by those rules. And I hate to be that guy because game =/= novel but it's a fun comparison to draw, but there are higher level fighters in even The North at any given time. And then there's the essay that Ed Greenwood wrote on the subject of the realm's best swordfighters in the year 1375 Dale Reckoning that, if I remember correctly, placed him at like 6th at the time? And 1375 is some ten years following the Icewind Dale trilogy. Fun note, that's not accounting for sword users with more than two arms, and almost everyone ahead of him was at least half elf, if not human. But of course that's Ed's opinion on the matter, but he'd also know best. And I mean, who knows, he might ACTUALLY be the best by the current realm time, but that gets into spoiler territory.  The lore of him being the realm's greatest swordsman is pretty much a commonfolk thing that adds to his myth and mystery, it serves as something to get his foot in the door in human society, more than an actual measure of his mettle as a warrior.  \-He has not lost once since Homeland  I guess it depends on how you define losing. He DOES get blind-sided by the mind-flayers, although that was hardly "fair" it's still losing. He didn't beat Zak's wraith, and it took the wraith committing suicide because of Zaknafein's influence to get him and his pals out of that tight spot. Entreri and Drizzt experienced a draw in Streams of Silver, but I guess that's more not-winning than losing, but Artemis had gotten what he wanted, and Drizzt failed as a hero in that regard, so I'll count it as a loss, though not a "dueling" loss. Any future examples or arguments would be spoilers.  (Fun non-spoiler there is a canonical "no answer" to a duel with a noble that Salvatore is deliciously devious in giving ambiguity regarding the real answer of who won)  \-He knows magic  Flaw of the setting, all Drow know magic, Drizzt simply has less magic than a mage, even in the Underdark he only had a few spells, and as the series draws on his ability in magic IS reeled back (justified by sun exposure but it's to match the games' change in mechanics regarding Drow magic) to make it work. All Drow were mini-mages, and the spells Drizzt has only are as great as they are because he knows how to use them creatively.  \-He is loved by everyone (only friends because racism)  Well I certainly HOPE his friends would like him lol. Jokes aside, he has enemies who he has met personally, Jarlaxle finds him charming but doesn't like Drizzt all that much. It's just hard to hate someone so pure and thoughtful once you meet them face-to-face. Trust me, I know.  \-Deep and Depressing Backstory  Most D&amp;D PCs do, there's a meme about it. Well-adjusted people with happy childhoods rarely go out on adventures to slay dragons and save the world, having a mildly inconvenient background is like one of the prerequisites to being interesting enough to care about in writing. Even in the call to action, and otherwise happy character can become more depressed.  Drizzt just has an especially fucked up back story, which leads to readers becoming more enthralled with him. It makes us want to cheer for him more because he's come so far.  \-You can't not like him because of his pitiful situation of no one else not liking him.  I feel like I addressed this one, but I'm anal-retentive about these kinds of list things lol.  \-He is wise, intelligent, strong, dextrous, and charismatic.  Another commenter put it beautifully already, and people point out that as you go on this gets fixed, but I'm going to put another gamer spin on this because why not?  Drizzt is of above-average strength, we never see him accomplish huge impressive feats of strength like others, and Wulfgar was established as canonically stronger than him in the first book, because Drizzt DID admit that he isn't really strong enough to make a warhammer suit his fighting style.  Drizzt is wise because of his experiences, but he always has something to learn, in Icewind Dale he is "default" wise, but we see him learn many of these hard lessons that gets him there in the Dark Elf trilogy, and we see him continue to learn after.  The intelligence point is fair, but try living for decades with a mind that wants to learn, and try NOT being at least somewhat intelligent.   The Dexterous point is supported by a natural proclivity that elves in that setting share, a natural talent that he possesses (somewhat inherited from his father given Zak's call to demand he be trained as a warrior and proving it through the coins) and then again DECADES of training/combat honing this dexterity and agility. If there were ever a thing that he would be justified at being good at, it's Dexterity.  Charisma is one I'll concede, he is VERY personable for someone who spends decades at a time in isolation, and before that was either constantly being abused, attempted-assassinated, or sternly taught swordplay. He shouldn't have natural charismatic skills, but to be fair, people still find charm in that "brooding loner" thing that he does, and I think his charisma comes more from his being a kind of person that others are attracted to, than anything of his own. Otherwise his best-kept friendship is one that started as a shaky alliance  that improved to a practical brotherhood over at least a decade.  To defend his BEING charismatic, I think a perpetual asshole wouldn't survive as a Drow on the surface, especially a Drow outcast. Jarlaxle is like IN with the Drow, and he still needs a sly tongue to survive the surface.  A quick reference, here are Drizzt's numeric stats during 2nd edition, I couldn't find 1st edition stat blocks just a level and god of worship:   STR 13   DEX 20   CON 15   INT 17   WIS 17   CHA 14   My description might have been colored by knowing these already, but I feel like for a rolled character he did SUPER well, but I would probably allow my player to run such a character, simply because these are still not in that "specialized" level in most places. He still can't break down doors, he's not learned enough in magic to do much about my magical issues, and the high specialization that other PCs will usually have to fill his roles. Drizzt is a character that's suitable for high-challenge games, and Salvatore seems to understand that well enough to give him high-challenge adventures.  &amp;#x200B;

Agreed.  I was struggling with the same thing, until someone told me that all I have to do is smile and say thank you.  Not only does it make you feel better by verbally and mentally confirming the compliment, but it makes the other person feel appreciated and validated for going out of their way to compliment you, which takes effort and energy.

Who bleeped this though?
I like the KFC ad with the family ignoring their son to instead gorge on chicken like madmen. Reminds me of my childhood.
Which society though? But generally no. Apart from English and German, so many languages don't have gender-neutral conjugation/sentence structure/nouns.  Like it's not just saying he/she, the sentence and a lot of the words used change depending on who I'm talking to or even about, and even objects are gendered, so most languages also don't have 'It'. Animals, objects, flowers, babies all need to be referred to by the proper terms, they even have separate 'The's'. Think 'Le/La Los/Las or the case in Arabic El or El with a silent L.   Yes, even the word YOU is gendered in plenty of languages. Not every language has the benefit of being grammatically easy as English, shit gets seriously complicated, like in Arabic we have to conjugate not just singular or plural but in *pairs*. 'Those two cats are eating their food' is different than 'The cat is eating her food' than 'The cat is eating his food' and 'The cats are eating their food' and are the plural cats females, males or a mixed group???  So telling me to say *'they'*, which again, is a very English concept because *they* in say Italian/Spanish/Arabic/French also depends on if its feminine plural or masculine plural, are we talking about a group of feminine nouns or masculine nouns? A pair of old women or a group of male cats or a bunch of feminine-noun'd tables?  &amp;#x200B;  So, despite their complications, I have no interest in changing any language to appease the First World whining of an ignorant white girl  &amp;#x200B;  I'm now having ugly flashbacks to Arabic grammar lessons
No sorry
I went in. Basically just didn't want to explain or lie about why I didn't.
How is this related to the USSR attacking Finland?
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/01/nj-democrats-threaten-to-toss-trump-from-the-2020-ballot-if-he-doesnt-release-his-tax-returns.html) reduced by 74%. (I'm a bot) ***** &gt; Democratic state lawmakers in New Jersey aren&amp;#039;t done seeking President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s tax returns.  &gt; Some members of the state Legislature have revived legislation that would require candidates for president and vice president to disclose their tax returns from the previous five years to appear on the ballot in the Garden State.  &gt; A Democratic congressman from New Jersey, U.S. Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-8th Dist., is leading a similar effort in Washington to force Trump&amp;#039;s tax returns to become public.   ***** [**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/alvu25/nj_democrats_threaten_to_toss_trump_from_the_2020/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ "Version 2.02, ~380583 tl;drs so far.") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **state**^#1 **Trump**^#2 **returns**^#3 **New**^#4 **bill**^#5

You just feel Entitled that a company should give you skins for free once you buy the game. BUT WAIT they DO. you can earn everything. So you‚Äôre complaining about the fact you can buy it is pointless. Cause it‚Äôs alllll earnable by just playing the game. 
THE NRA IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT   Why do people have such a hard time with this? And also, why does Trump need all these meetings and back room deals? They‚Äôve already got a pipeline to Russia don‚Äôt they?   Why did Veselnistkya lie about her meeting? Why did she meet with fusion GPS the day before and after she had that meeting? Why did Loretta Lynch give her a special visa into the country?  Why did Don Jr show the world his emails? Because it‚Äôs NOT ILLEGAL. It‚Äôs not illegal to know Russian people. It‚Äôs not illegal to meet with them. It‚Äôs not even illegal to oppo research from Russian! Isn‚Äôt that right Christopher Steele and Hillary Clinton? But because the media has turned it *into* a crime for Donald Trump, I‚Äôm not surprised his team hasn‚Äôt been forthcoming about every Russian they‚Äôve ever shared a room with when the press turns drinking a White Russian into a media event.   Ok so how about you answer a single fucking question I asked now huh? Why does every single ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù trumps supposed to be involved with have something to do with our intelligence agencies, Hillary Clinton, or the Obama administration? Why didn‚Äôt Comey tell Congress about his spying operation for 9 months? Why did Mike Rogers snub Obama and what did he tell Trump? Why don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs a big deal how much misconduct went down at the FBI and how many have been fired? Why was it okay for Peter Strzok to work on muellers team along with several other deeply conflicted individuals? Why was Comey leaking to the press? Why did he lie about it?
