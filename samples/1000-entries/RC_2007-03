&gt; Various Left-leaning organizations tend to cite a minority of scientists, too. Sounds like we're catching on. Sounds like we both realize we need to listen to the scientific consensus, not to cherrypicked opinions. &gt; For instance, only 18% of the scientists who received questionnaires for the recent IPCC study returned them. Irrelevant because  1) I was talking about the NAS, not the IPCC.  2) There is no reason to suppose that this 18% was biased, as long as the IPCC surveys were sent to a fair cross section of scientists. Both believers and skeptics of warming had the opportunity to send their (supposed) surveys back.  3) I can't even find the survey on the net, including the IPCC. Can you provide any evidence that this (supposed) IPCC survey contributed to the final IPCC results (which haven't even been published yet, if I understand correctly)?

This is such a troll. Using a light editor is nice when you are writing, say Ruby or Python. IDE's are not useful and they are simply in your way. Writing Java or C++ benefits from the IDE features. Use the right tools for the right job people.

That line struck me as odd, too, but I find it even funnier that all of the many responses to your comment focused on the tax thing (perhaps due to reddit's libertarian bent) and not (and I think maybe this is what you were getting at) that even if it *were* a tax on the poor, the part that follows that is completely inconsistent with that notion. How can a tax on the poor result in transferring wealth **to** the underprivileged??
Good to hear you trade bonds; I trade options, equity and forex (USD/JPY mainly) - will keep an eye out for you! You sound a lot like Paul McCulley with that asset/leverage economy idea.

"What? Go back and read my post you stupid fuck. Why don't you learn to fucking read before having conversation OK." Retard.  Your "quiz" said that raising the interest rate will have the effect of either A OR B, increase OR decrease inflation, which means you believe interest rate increase could sometimes do one OR the other at different times. You can't even understand your own fucking statements.  Don't fucking get mad at me because you don't understand simple concepts.  You living brain fart! "Wow. really? How come no book on economics says that? How come the wikipedia does not say that. Why don't you read what they say and come back to me OK?" Who needs to look up everything on wiki?  Are you incapable of understanding basic economics?   When the money supply goes up too fast, inflation results.  Go look at zimbabwe or the other fucking example I gave you before.  Honestly, you're so fucking stupid I'm surprised you're capable of even typing. "I never said it was. But then again you don't seem to understand cause and effect." That's good that you understand that putting statements in the form of a quiz is not science, but since we were BLOODY FUCKING TALKING about the difference in science and idealogy, which you STILL can't get through your head isn't philosophy, you implied that you were trying for a scientific method when you immediately JUMPED to using that form. In other words, you HAD NO FUCKING REASON to switch to using a quiz format other than to be a dickhead. "Either A causes B or it does not. It's very simple. If A causes B then every time A happens B happens WITHOUT EXCEPTION." No.  You could say the same about global warming then.  Inflation isn't an immediate result of the money supply increase, nor is it ALWAYS going to happen unless the economy CAN'T HANDLE THE SUDDEN INCREASE.  Do you GET THE FUCKING DIFFERENCE? If you throw a sudden influx of money into an economy, and the economy can't grow fast enough to handle it, THEN you get inflation. This is WHY I SHOWED YOU ZIMBABWE as an example. Fucking retard. "If you find one exception then the law is invalid." It's not a fucking law, dipshit, anymore than people have figured out how to predict global warming or even if it's going to freaking rain next week. Basic nationwide things such as tax cuts or interest rates are known to have certain affects, but the model is too complex to predict it closely enough to know how long something will take or how quickly it will impact, nor is it simple to account for 10 million smaller variables.  Rocket science is simple relative to this. Again, because details aren't simple to predict doesn't mean general direction can't be estimated. "Mostly because you are fucktard." LOL  you can't even get the insult right.  I think you meant "Mostly because you ARE a fucktard." but it's more accurate to say you're brain damaged than I'm a fucktard. Go back to school and learn the difference between idealogy and science, you twit.

I think you are confusing economists with politicians.  Economists don't necessarily have any reason to make things look like less of a problem.  If anything it is the reverse - no economic problems entails no demand for economists.

You tie Creationists and Conspiracy theorists when they both use the fallacy of False Dilemma. Example: The false dilemma of the creationist is that the only two possibilities of an explanation of the origin of life are   a) Evolution  b) Creationism Therefore all one must do is poke holes in Evolution to prove Creationism. Example of Conspiracy theorists:  the only two possibilities are   A) Official Story  B) Vast untold/untellable Conspiracy The flaw is in thinking the only proof necessary for B is a rebuttal of A. This is common in most conspiracies and quite evident in 9/11 theories. At least JFK Conspiracies postulate a boogie man, be it the mob or the Cubans or the trilateral commission. All 9/11 conspiracy theorists seem to think they need to do is just point out perceived flaws in the 'official' story. I have yet to hear a comprehensive theory that explains an alternative explanation of all the events on 9/11.

So, first you try to tell _me_ what _I_ think, and then you give me the old "you have not presented a reason for X..." bullshit. What do you think the entire discussion of "selection effect" was, some sort of random diversion? You can claim it's a _bad_ reason, but to claim _no_ reason was given means you're either incapable of reading or thoroughly disingenuous. Either way, we're done here; there's enough people around here who don't stoop to such low, low rhetorical tricks that it's not worth my time.

I'm thinking back to the days when I worked at Future Shop. We were on comission there at that time, and I think they still are. I remember no one would ever let a sale go unless we rang it in ourselves. Even so, to get a discount it would have had to have been bundled together in a "package price" so there would be no way to remove the one item without redoing the whole invoice.
You'll find references to people saying that they "could care less", too. That doesn't make it okay with me.
Then you'd better never try to buy a new car from regular car dealers. I understand your point, but I disagree.  If a store gets away with lying to the consumer, they have no reason to stop.  If their lying to customers causes them loss like this, they will institute rules to try to prevent it and either manage to shut themselves down entirely or become honest instead. There are lots of honest stores that don't try it and get repeat customers.  They could easily switch and become honest too. Look at Microsoft.  They instituted so many rules and idiotic features into Vista that they are hurting their own sales.  DRM and attempts to eliminate piracy are probably going to cause DRM producers and products like vista to go down the toilet, making room for more reasonable products. The same could happen to stores like BB.  They will institute so many rules to prevent customers from getting the better of their dishonest practices that they will go out of business.

Yeah, he may have misinterpreted the advice.  Almost all of us leave the charger plugged in while not in use.  This doesn't usually make a difference because the circuit is not completed.  The problem is that many of us charge cell phones overnight (even if they are not fully empty) so they are left plugged in for hours when they are already topped up.  This would drastically decrease the battery life of your li-ion AND would consume a lot of extra electricity.

For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work."*

I'm not a huge fan of the Conservative party, but at least they tend to be consistent. Keep in mind that the Chretien Liberals forced this through the house back in the day. For now I'd rather have a Conservative (minority) government than have the Liberals back in power.
Nice try. How about this? Maybe they deified a natural phenomenon they did not understand and wrote about it in supernatural terms and now, through tradition, you believe this to be the divine word spoken by the creator of the universe? That sounds more plausible to me.
You are absolutely wrong about the steel. Steel weakens under heat long before it melts. That's why it is critical to put fireproofing material on steel in buildings. Unfortunately, when you fly a jetliner through a steel frame building, it tends to disrupt the fireproofing, as well as taking away a lot of the structural redundancy of the building.

Still upvoting this, though, that moonwhatever bomb scare was just way too idiotic.

The parent comment is what was called a *pun*. A sure sign of this is the emphasis of words that have multiple meanings, each of which is valid to a different interpretation of the sentence. The above was creating a neologism, a verb form of the noun "bear"--the large woodland creature that is capable, among other things, of mauling children. *Bear*ing one's breasts, instead of baring them, might in fact have terrorizing consequences (especially for the bear.)

Right down to kings ordering the breeding of vegatables in the royal colours. And since we're all decended from a common branch, there is really nothing terrifically foriegn about moving genes from random creatures to other random creatures. It just offends your sense of the natural order.  And I'm married to a microbiology major, and I have lunch 4 days a week with biologists. We've discussed this at length.

No I'm just pointing out to you how it doesn't get you very far to go down that road in a discussion.  If you want to point out that America was partly responsible for the civil war in Iraq, great.  That doesn't change the fact that most of the deaths in Iraq are due to Iraqis killing each other over religious differences.   You seem to be side stepping the main cause of the civil war.  Did the US start it? Yes, but we are past that.  If the US pulled out tomorrow that wouldn't stop the civil war.  Until Muslims are able to think rationally about their religion and not get upset over cartoons in a entirely different continent they will always be tools of mullahs and religious leaders.

Well yes, but since national economics on a global scale are overseen if not directly managed by politicians I argue that as with everything else economics has not escaped the meddling of government and its need to make itself look better than it really is.

From my POV, Lua's biggest drawback is that all arithmetic seems to be done with doubles. No big integers, no fractions. Using inexact numbers for everything seems a bit unpredictable, especially with dynamic typing. Other than that, it looks like a nice language, if I ignore my horrible bias against having hard-coded imperative control structure in a language.

&gt;If you are writing over 100k of source code to solve this problem, you are doing something seriously wrong.  You're thrashing a straw dummy. If I write 67,000 lines of source code to print out "Hello World", that's also too much.  But *how* is it too much? The primary *way* that "too big" code is "too big" is not because it's verbose. It's because it performs too many operations.  So as I said, if you're counting characters or lines of source code, you're missing the point. Count operations.  Of course, in order to count (or at least estimate) operations, one needs to understand both the compilation process, and the resulting machine or assembly language. And this, in turn, suggests an improvement exercise far more useful than golf: Write compilers. With a couple of compilers under one's belt, one begins to be able to pierce the abstraction layer of source code and think about what one's executable is doing on the metal. Certainly a profiler helps with this (and if you don't profile, then you're worrying about optimization too early), but a good coder should be able to predict with a good degree of accuracy what the profiler is going to tell him.  In sum, optimizations that shrink the source code may be true or false optimizations. Optimizations that shrink the machine code are true optimizations (for space), and optimizations that shrink the operation count are true optimizations (for speed).  Golf may be valid on a level of 100k vs. 50k, but when one starts counting bytes, it's just a cleverness contest. And coders should be smart, not clever.

Here's the question that comes to my mind: If the word is losing it's taboo because of a shift in use, doesn't banning it (or otherwise insisting that it is extra-special) just prop up its power to offend? Might this "just" be a rough spot in a linguistic shift that allows for future generations,  of all colors, not no longer be able to use the word in a hurtful way? It's obviously no fun for people with personal experience being called a nigger by some hateful cracker.  But is it possible that 20 year from now that will won't be possible? Can the N-bomb be defused?

*Hide*: To prevent the disclosure or recognition of; conceal. My point was not that the article does not address proxies, but that the article makes an unnecessary distinction between "obscuring" an IP address, and "hiding" it. If I can send you data without knowing your IP address, then I'd say that the IP address is adequately hidden.  When a sniper conceals himself in some trees, we don't say, "Well, he's not *hiding*, he's just obscuring his location by putting leaves in front of him," because that would be silly. Likewise, the author is being silly when he says you can't hide your IP address. Now, granted, he's address a common misconception, and yes, an IP address is necessary to receive information, and yes, his analogy pizza is, by and large, an apt one. But I do take objection to his strange and misleading distinction between "hiding" something, and "obscuring" it.
&gt;Non-sequitur - so what about the twin towers? No &gt;buildings had already fallen near them, and yet they were &gt;the first two steel-framed buildings in the world to &gt;collapse "because of fire". If you can explain this away, &gt;you have a point. If not, introducing the fall of WTC7 is &gt;irrelevant when arguing the veracity of the conspiracy &gt;theories. Here we go.  Because some unempoyed pot head tells you that no steel building has ever collapsed because of fire DOES NOT MAKE IT TRUE.  What is true is that a fully fueled airliner traveling at maxiumum speed has NEVER crashed into a sky scraper before.  Frankly it is a miracle that the buildings stood for as long as they did.

That is part of the problem, this is a very serious situation and you turn it into a joke. Burn in hell. 
Yes, that is true (I think this might actually be how ghc does it internally), however, this can be a little confusing to non-haskellers.  Obviously there is no real "state of the world" data, it's just a dummy variable, in order to allow uniformity in the treatement of functions.  It won't reorder IO functions, as each depends on the output of the previous. On an aside, it'd be interesting if a system could be constructed which makes assumptions on which IO actions may affect others, allowing it to reorder for optimization.

This is true. But I was talking about milk, and specifically, I was talking about how the fact that we've evolved to tolerate the milk of other species doesn't indicate that regular consumption of it is good for us. I think the case is different with meat. We've been eating meat since before we got to our current position on the evolutionary chain, and there's evidence that suggests that the switch to an omnivorous diet (which was probably initially done just to stay alive when vegetation was scarce) made proteins and fats available for use in future adaptations, especially the brain. That said, that doesn't mean we *must* continue eating meat, or even that it is the healthiest dietary choice, since we have now developed agriculture and industry to the point where those necessary nutrients that were once only consistently available in an omnivorous diet are now consistently available to us from non-animal sources, and often with less or none of the unhealthy things we get along with those nutrients in meat.
You are grossly mis-informed about your own country. Unless you are an Indian Citizen, you cannot freely enter and move about in Sikkim. Foreigners need a special permit to enter sikkim and even then they can only go to a few selected areas, far less anywhere near the border.

'If this were any other line of work, nobody would care that she does this on the side.' Good argument.  If she were a preacher, I'm sure her Church wouldn't care about what she does on the side.

Oh without calling in CSI to investigate this, the likely reason is simple.  A reporter from another country got confused.  Before that day in 2001 I didn't even know there were more than two buildings to the WTC, much less what all their names were.  You don't think it's possible with all the building falling down, someone from miles away and from one of the wrost angles I have seen the disaster shot from, could have mixed up two of the buildings?

I still consider it a better batter than running my own business.   I could run a business, I'm good at programing though, and I'm not good at dealing with people.   So it is questionable if any business I start would do well. Yes I can be laid off - happens all the time in fact.   However I just collect my unemployment for a month or two and then start a new position.   Business owners are not eligible for unemployment, so when they fail they are in a worse position than me.
Hospitals are required to provide emergency medical services to anyone who requires them, regardless of ability to pay. In contrast, dentists don't have to take a patient for a check-up if they don't want to. It's the same thing with routine doctor's visits. We end up paying more in emergency room visits than we would if we would just give the poor access to routine medical care. It's a sad state of affairs.

Shakespeare, apparently, is a neurolinguistic programmer. I heard this trick used in the dating "game" a while ago--use words that have multiple possible linguistic functions, or make their function vague, and a person will both *activate their mind*, and along with it their empathy-generation center/lobe/whatever, and will also become slightly confused, putting them in a more receptive state for further tactics.
But what I hear, is that you'd have to have a National Id to make that easy enough to enforce, just an SSN is too easy to get, or something.

You're confusing the cost (to the store) with the price (to the customer). The price is more or less up to the store, taking into account all relevant factors (the cost for the store to buy it from the manufacturer, what competitors are charging, recent sales trends for the item, etc.). The store can determine the price, and any discounts, as it sees fit, and your choice as the customer is to take it or leave it (outside of negotiative examples like the car dealership above). It's perfectly normal for a store to offer a discount on the item if you buy certain other things (warranty, ink cartridges, software bundle, second of the same item, etc.). To me, taking that discount without buying the certain-other-things—a condition of the deal, really, whether or not the store is strict about enforcing it—is nothing more than swindling.

Yeah.  But an MBA isn't particularly useful as a predictor of ability to run a great business.   Thus you can fail at several businesses in a row - many people do.   Some hit on a successful business, but I haven't proof that it isn't blind luck.   
&gt; Why is it that programmers constantly feel the need to rank themselves and others, to say that person X is quantifiably better than person Y Perhaps because the core of programming is abstracting real-world systems and objects (such as people) into numbers which can be manipulated?
First, if you knew something of New Testament critical analysis, you would know that most scholars are not "believers." Most of them (I'm excluding the religious fundamentalist fanatics) are scholars first have much more passion for ancient texts than they do religious ideaology. Second, why do you assume that ancient text scholars are less capable of objectivity than a historian, anthropoligist or scientist? You seem to think you're capable of objectivity -- but an Ivy league educated scholar isn't?
this article is insurance company propaganda. The problem is NOT a lack of INSURANCE. The problem is a lack of national healthcare, paid for by taxes. Kill off the healthcare insurance companies. America should ensure itself. Just keep out the illegal aliens with a good ID system, then stop spending so much on the military and pay for healthcare for all citizens by the income tax, and increase the taxes on the rich. 
intruiging
You won. I can't believe I'm replying to this but you're trolling skills have hooked me in. In fact I'm going to give you another conspiracy theory to chew on at the end of my post. &gt; AFter 9/11 Afghanistan war (Unocal pipeline lock for nearly 15 years is finally allowed - Hamid Karzai (the new president of Afghanistan since 2001 was a unocal executive)) The Unocal deal was a piddly affair that was never followed through because of much larger geographical and political issues. There are *hundreds* of proposals made every year by energy companies that are way more feasible than Unocal. But I'll get back to this point later. &gt; Sadaam was about to convert to the Euro the oil markets in IRAQ would have led to further dollar crash (Iran is threatening the same thing) Um yeah, the Dollar would have crashed if UN-embargoed Iraq set the price of it's oil in Euros. Trust me, this is by far the weakest of your reasons. &gt; Let's see what the benefits to the arabs were: The arabs??? WTF. Of course it wasn't the Arabs as a whole ... it was Osama and Al Qaeda, essentially a splinter of the Muslim Brotherhood - violently kicked out of the Arab countries they were originally from. They've been engaging in terrorism for decades like the previous WTC bombing and the Al Khobar attack. *Most* terrorists don't get shit for their actions except a sense of perverse satisfaction - how has the life of the average Palestinian improved after the hundreds of bombs exploded in Israel by Hamas/PLO. Besides Osama probably believed the hype that he and his Taliban buddies were impregnable in Afghanistan.   But to give you a conspiracy theory of my own. There was one guy who benefited immensely from the aftermath of 9/11. From being an economic pariah, he became a major 'ally' in the war on terror, getting billions of dollars in economic and military aid. His selling nuclear technologies to countries like N Korea and Libya was overlooked by the US. Not to mention a lucrative book deal, and an appearance on the Daily Show. A member of a secret intelligence service that created and funded the Taliban in the first place, funnily enough, it was his country that would have benefited the most if the Unocal deal had gone through. Nope you're wrong trying to pin the blame on Dicke Cheyney, the real mastermind was [Gen Pervez Musharraf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musharaff)

It is standard bomb disposal technique. Sometimes you blow apart the bomb parts before the detonate (assuming something fairly stable like plastique) but more often you do detonate the larger bomb.  The logic is you control when the detonation happens so you can evacuate, protect things first, etc.   It is extremly dangerous to try to defuse a bomb.  Something that rarely happens outside of hollywood.
That is so sad...

I say Arabs because that is what people think like you usually. It just so happens these arabs were all used in military cases before, they even were right across the street from the NSA at one point.   Al-Qeada is the name "the base" and it was used to identify "freedom fighers" we used in Afghanistan in the 80's against the USSR. These guys were all at one time CIA assets including Osama through 1979-1993. I really think you need to read this when you question the pipeline.  http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/timeline.jsp?before_9/11=pipelinePolitics&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=unocal and this for motive  http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=project_for_the_new_american_century http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a99uswantsoil#a99uswantsoil This pipeline was essentially for Pakistan and Turkmenistan and was key to getting trillions in oil transported.  Trillions is more than Afghanistans GDP for many centuries. Hardly a "piddly affair".   If you had to motivate a country for war, that you knew was evident over energy/economy, how would you do it?

(Subscription required) Most reference works will list common usage, including common errors. This is especially true of errors that have been grandfathered in over time. I tend to accept the descriptivist position, personally, but I see no need to put up with flagrant mistakes. And make no mistake, this is fairly flagrant. "Boo coo" implies a substantial mispronunciation beyond the atrocious spelling.

Why would this not have been caught on simulated flights?  I assumed they flew these things all over the world into ever conceivable scenario on simulators, with all the inputs as they would be if the planes were actually in those locations.  Do they not test airplanes that way?  If they do, how could they have missed this? Is there another source to verify that this story is real?
Someone needs to introduce this guy to all the advances in command line tools.   Gcc gives much better error messages these days.   Make (which has been around for a long time) knows to build only the files that need building.   Emacs and vim both can start gcc with a simple command tool. Debuggers are nice, but they tempt you to spend a lot of time stepping through a bug instead of trying to understand it, so printf often ends up being faster even though you have to recompile all the time. Now the only IDE I've used enough to comment on is Visual Studio 6, and it sucks.   (Part of this is our project - those who have used it on other projects assure me that it isn't nearly that bad normally)

1. Naming something "Lolita" is indeed an invitation to controversy. 2. But you didn't get Entropy's joke. 3. It's not particularly nasty if you consider that the name is a reference to one of the most well-known novels of the twentieth century. 4. It's pretty easy to find the program simply by searching for 'lolita haskell' or 'lolita natural language processing' .
Places like Best Buy don't care about their customers. It's always about the money for them with little regard for the actual customer. I honestly wouldn't feel bad or guilty doing this. Neither should anyone else. It's just how it works. Either live by your principles and make yourself feel good, or save big bucks on your purchase and for once send corporations like Best Buy a message that they aren't the only ones who can do whatever they want. They rip off people so much, this thought shouldn't even cross someones mind while doing it. Ever tried getting them to price match products? Good luck not being slapped with their policy and  fine print on the price match that actually renders the whole purpose of price matching useless. Or even trying to get a person there to actually even consider it, you'd be faced with lies as to why they cannot do it.
I wish someone could teach me some of these things.   Many of those that I have learned something about I need more work on. Unfortunately these are mostly life skills - I'm not sure they can be taught.
As Joel Spolsky points out on his website, but Atwood fails to mention, the reason 199 out of 200 programmers can't program is because they are the losers that keep getting circulated around from company to company. It's naive to think that the applicants for a job are going to be uniformly spread out across the talent continuum. 99.5% of them are going to be crap, because all of the good programmers are ALREADY HIRED!

Yeah, that's a good point... It should still have only one numeric type, but automatic number widening etc.  Ideally perhaps real number support, though stuff like that is more likely to pop up in haskell-land. Then again, this might get in the way of its use as a scripting language.

&gt;So, in addition to being a liar, you're intentionally tempting someone's greed and encouraging an illegal act? Why is this even illegal?  Stores have policies and fine prints of their own that only exist to maximise their profits and work for their own, sole gain. They have policies that dictate everything on the store, and the customer is always coerced into agreeing with them on whatever the store policy says. Changing your mind about the warranty after the price has been lowered is as legitimate as them setting up the restrictions in the first place, where you are lured into the store attracted by a price only to be shown the fine print which negates the entire deal. When you think about it, it's not different than a person changing his mind about the warranty when you get to pay for the product. You have the choice to do so, so why not save money where stores like Best Buy and Circuit City continue to make them in abundance.

Start with Scheme.  SICP style.  Then Prolog, teaching them logical programming.  Then Haskell, teaching them laziness and purity.  Then Smalltalk or Java to thoroughly explore OO.  Finally I'd teach Erlang. That should give them a good overview of all the major paradigms and in a decent order.  Scheme is simple and can teach them the basics of a wide array of styles.  A background in Prolog will give them a good understanding of Haskell types.  Having a Scheme background will make it easy to pick up on OO.  Finally, Message Passing via Erlang will be much more natural given backgrounds in both functional and OO languages. 
Pretty vague in the details. Was this about gay "marriage"? Hmm. Okay. Gays have a right to get married that is identical to that of non-gays. They don't want that, though--they want a very, very different one. Not a big deal. If this guy supports the various effects of gay "marriage"--basically an alteration of allocation of health care benefits, a different tax structure for certain people, etc, etc, along with certain social effects ("You guys are getting married--that is _so gay_!") so be it. What bugs me is the conflating of older civil rights "battles" with gay "marriage". For better or worse (most would say worse) the U.S. had an apartheid system pre-1960s in certain regions. Now it's gone. That's a pretty big change. If gay "marriage" becomes conventional, it will not have righted any wrongs, but simply (as I said) change health care, taxes, etc. This is mainly what the old rich queens are concerned about. Big deal.
"it's not really reasonable to blame the expanding middle class for the price of a kilo of onions to quintuple this quickly." You know, you're totally right about that.  I wonder what it is about onions.  I suspect it's more than just the weather or transport, because the prices of other vegetables haven't risen quite as much.  One effect a newly rich middle class could have on a rise in onion prices is that its much better at absorbing the increase.  Meaning, because the onion is a staple, and because the middle-class can afford paying more for onions without substituting them out for other veggies, even when its price rises, people will still buy a similar amount of onions.  Now as compared to 10 years ago, each rupee increase in the price of a kilo of onion results in a much smaller decrease in the amount of onion in demand. Then there's always the transfer to the onion producers- I'm sure they're enjoying this.
Ha! I'm already finished.

&gt;Many African American community leaders, with the backing of fellow lawmakers, say it is offensive in every context and that is a word which should never be said. I know it's snarky to pounce on generalizations like these, but the fact is, they're wrong. It is not offensive in every context. It's pretty obvious it isn't. Mind you, I know which contexts make it offensive, and I avoid them. But there's no such thing as a word that should never be said.

If the Democrats are willing to go all the way if need be, this might be a credible threat. There are some inklings the administration would back down against a determined opposition, but there are also signs they would push all the way toward a constitutional crisis. If the Democrats are willing to go there like the Republicans were, maybe there'll be some change.

I 100% guarantee that if there were only tombs marked Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and maybe a brother, and the tomb for Jesus was empty, then Kurt and all the other Christians would scream at it as proof that Christ was real and he ascended. The religious only disregard science when it disproves something they claim. If science ever agreed with religious beliefs it would held up as proof.
Yes, it is. Read my comment for an explanation of why mistakes are in reference works. Or don't, since that seems to be your m.o.
I see your point--he may be gnostic (he may believe in the mystic Jesus) because he speaks like he never met Jesus or didn't have the inside information (ie: he doesn't mention the same stories found in the gospels).  But Paul wasn't an original follower of Jesus.  It seems like his writing accurately, honestly reflects a lack of specific intimate details about Jesus's ministry.

Corporate America is so skewed in all the advantages they have against poor people, that any person buying anything at any store should do whatever they can to pay as little as possible.  Stealing it is the best (like Robin Hood), but the risks of trying to do that are very high.  Weigh your risks, can you afford being arrested?  FIGHT THE POWER fight the smug bastards who have all the money but only earned all that money by being slimeballs.

You gotta give the thinking computers a few more years. It's going to be a combination of increased processors and reverse engineering the brain. In all likelyhood, what we will see first is thinking software developed for individual tasks like semantic searching. Imagine being able to search for whatever you want...using whatever terms you want...conducting a virtual conversation with the search agent and having the results returned in an annotated report. It's pretty cool stuff. Anyhow, my point is, you can't just go from 1 to 10. There are steps along the way. One the bright side, we're moving in the right direction.

Interracial marriage was still illegal  in some places until 1967.  blacks had  a right to get married that is identical to that of non-blacks. They didn't want that, though--they wanted to marry the person that they loved. Changing that did not right any wrongs just heath care ect. Thats all that black were concerned about.  Big deal.
Awesome. The only downside I see: No translation of 1-based indices to zero-based indices. But that isn't possible—there's no way for an Apple event table to indicate whether it's an index or just a number—so I can't blame the implementors for this.

Is posting something this poorly thought out a subtle admission that you are full of crap?  I think so.  The fact that you *still* have not made a defense of your statement about Olbermann pretty much seals it. Saddam was not even *close* to the same league as Hitler, and comparing the two is simply wrong.  It's like saying that finding a quarter on the ground is like finding a suitcase stuffed to the brim with hundred dollar bills.  Sure, technically a comparison could be made, but only an intellectually dishonest person would make it.  In insisting on comparing Saddam to Hitler you are trivializing what Hitler did.  In trivializing what Hitler did, you are offering a defense of Hitler.  We already went over that and you just restated your erroneous view without addressing anything I said.  In offering a defense of Hitler you are really doing what you claimed Olbermann did, a claim you did not even try to defend.  How does it feel to be such an utter and complete hypocrite? You are a moral degenerate incapable of admitting error no matter how egregious your errors are.  At this point, I'm not really offended since I can't really care too much about what you say, given that you are either so brazenly unreflective or so incredibly intellectually dishonest that your opinion has no value whatever.  While you should apologize, the apology you really owe is to yourself to yourself for debasing yourself this badly in intellectually immoral sophistry.  I do feel sorry for you, you've sunk yourself into a serious low, you have humiliated yourself.  All I can do is try to help, by recommending you face the truth.  The first step to facing the truth is learning to admit that you are wrong.  While it's hard to say, it appears that your egotism is likely to be at the root of why you can't admit your errors.  I'd recommend less self-seeking, and spending some time seriously reflecting on how you could let yourself descend to such a degenerated state.  Good luck.

Artificial intelligence IS just task-clever tools and clever programming.  Until the computing hardware paradigm changes from just doing what we've always done but faster, then the software will just do what it's always been able to do, with a few new tricks because of added speed. If it was possible to have a close approximation to a real non-deterministic Turing machine (i.e. massively massively massively parallel), then we'd maybe have a chance.  Until then, sorry. (I am an AI researcher.)

Dude - I just read the whole story ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lou_franklin/Archive ).  It is true that you made one good edit - removing the protestanism thing.  In fact the wiki folks agreed with you on that.  Unfortunately you deleted other folks comments from talk pages repeatedly - quite rude. In point fact you were removed for having two sock puppets, lying about it and then threatening an admin. Please tell the truth. 
Computers 'think' all the time, in the strict sense of the word. What you mean to ask is: "where are the *conscious* computers?"  This is a loaded question, of course, because it's not clear what consciousness entails. If you're really interested in the subject, see Dennett or Minksy.

Or you could just buy your expensive TV online. I saved $1200 on an LCD TV by ordering it online, and it came with free white glove shipping. The downside with doing this is, you can't usually return it, and you will have to rely on the warranty if there is a problem. But with white glove shipping, they will take the TV out of the box, set it up on your stand and let you examine it before you sign off on the shipment. You can always refuse delivery if you spot the problem. Why go to all that trouble to save a few hundred bucks when you can save over a thousand from the comfort of home?
One thing people misunderstand a lot, is that "roger" only means "received" or "I heard you."  It does *not* mean yes. 
I only mentioned 1 Co. in reference to the article which said this: &gt;Would Paul have written "If a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him" if Jesus Christ had had long hair? Given that Paul never met the living Jesus, it's pointless to even use it as a source.  I don't think Paul's idea of Jesus' appearance is relevant.  Even if his visions were genuine (and I doubt that), it's not reasonable to believe that Paul knew what the living Jesus looked like based on those. With respect to Paul's views on Jesus, while he was more interested in Jesus as a spiritual figure redeeming through his death, I think we can assume that Paul did believe that Jesus was an actual living person who died.   That is really an important part of his theology.

Outside of the context of a monopoly, I'm not sure why there would be. Chances are, the law is bad, and the practice of discounting for those who buy an extended warranty is ethical even if illegal. But encouraging people to break the law so you can exploit their greed... that alone is wrong, even if you don't have to lie to do so. &gt;Changing your mind about the warranty after the price has been lowered is as legitimate If someone were truly changing their mind, this would be borderline. But, having read the article, it's clear that there was never any intent to purchase the warranty. Feigning interest was dishonest. &gt; When you think about it, it's not different than a person changing his mind about the warranty when you get to pay for the product. It is different. A person who changes their mind wanted it, but some other concern or worry finally seemed important enough that they no longer could. Or they were capricious, and said what the hell. This though, he went into the store with the intention of lying where he never had even a little interest in purchasing the warranty. That's not ethical. That's just sad.
I disagree, but that's cool.

That was written with you in mind. I already wrote why I hate you. You're the kind of idiot that already has and will continue to seriously fuck up the world I live in. In case you're too thick, *knowing* you're too thick, the peak of oil production happened 21 months ago. We are into oil decline. Which means economic recessions followed by economic depression followed by economic collapse. The same kind of economic collapse that cut a decade off the life expectancy of Russian men and women when it happened to them. People are going to die because of you.
If you hold up your side of the bargain. When you renege and then receive the discount anyway because a large store splits up the salesmanship from the register clerk, that's a swindle.

No, I mean the Dow dropped over 1% on one tick which caused a panic. It's really not much of a story at all. NYSE had all time record volume and the computers that create the index couldn't handle all the traffic. They weren't reporting the correct index value for about an hour and when all of a sudden they corrected themselves, the Dow was 178 pts lower than the previous tick.

You just can't detect it by feel because it's so low. A sure way to reduce the life of your Lithium Ion battery is to constantly discharge then recharge it.

&gt; programmer sarcasm. Only teenagers have sarcasm.  Anyone else -- even someone younger than a teenager, even if she apes a teenager -- has something more interesting. My two Forth solutions come explained by the comments they appear in.  My Perl solution is intentionally odd.  I really like the way my Mercury solution orders its arguments and (commutative) goals -- e.g., the main/2 goals mirror a Haskell solution that would use the IO monad and two variable bindings under a 'where'; I'm only disappointed that I didn't put nondeterminancy in it.  Of course, you might call the Mercury solution 'obfuscated' for intentionally putting uses of logical variables before bindings of logical variables, but that only bothers someone who doesn't know the language at all.  -Real- 'obfuscated solutions' only demand higher or quirkily-high language familiarity; real -obfuscation- deliberately deceives in less interesting ways, e.g. by naming things contrary to their meaning.

I fail to see how asking the store to give you a discount is so terrible.   Nowhere do you sign a contract and then flake on it or give any solemn vows... you simply verbally state you are *interested* in the warranty and ask for the form.   And you are legitimately, honestly *interested* in the warranty because it'll get you a fat discount...you never swore to actually purchase the damn thing.  :-)

Being an amateur radio operator, I do have some insight into this sort of thing.  Things like "roger" and "10-4" are often used interchangeably to indicate acknowledgment and oftentimes to express agreement with what's being "rogered." One small caveat, though, is that using 10-codes is generally frowned upon in the amateur community - we tend to favor the international [Q-signals](http://www.ac6v.com/Qsignals.htm) instead. QSL is used pretty much the same as "roger" and 10-4. I've actually found that each radio service has its own distinct lingo.  For example, I can tell just by listening to the jargon whether I'm listening to a ham, a CB-er, a pilot, or a cop - without checking the frequency.

That's because they are. When the merge happened, the rules for members' voting in internal party elections changed. As you can guess, they changed to give the Canadian Reform Alliance Party more power. You may not remember but the Reform party started by sucking away all of the fascists and neo-nazis out of the New Democratic Party. The NDP has always been center-left but it's always harboured a great many right-wing extremists protesting both the Liberal and Conservative parties. The conservative party leadership, based in Ontario, absolutely refused to entertain right-wing extremists in the form of religious nutballs. Ontario is a uniformly liberal christian province. Oh you're atheist? Well what's wrong with being liberal christian! Oh you're fundamentalist? Haha, liberal christians are so much better than you! That's the kind of mentality. So Reform started as an offshoot of the NDP and Conservatives then it merged back into the Conservatives from a position of power. The end result is the NDP is weakened and the Conservatives are far more right-wing.
Oh, I get it. "1984" comes to pass, not because of a massive totalitarian government, but because law enforcement is too fucking dumb to know that *some boxes and objects in the city may not be bombs* and start claiming ever damn telephone post is a terrorist listening center or somesuch before blowing it to hell.
&gt; Using inexact numbers for everything seems a bit unpredictable Keep in mind that with doubles you still have way more "exact" integer precision than with 32-bit ints, for a double-precision mantissa is 52 bits. But I do agree that using doubles as the default number representation is a rather odd design decision, and the lack of integrated bignums (with automatic widening and so on) is certainly a blotch.
Good luck.

Second post today on "banning" a word. &gt;an alien to me is somebody from out of space. There's the saturation of UFOs and spaceman movies, I guess. If people no longer see _alien_ as meaning "foreign, from another place" then maybe it is appropriate to call them something else. As to what to call them; &gt;..."They are immigrants, through no fault of their own, not aliens." &gt;Wilson said the first word isn't as bad as the second. &gt;"'Illegal,' I can live with, but I like 'undocumented' better," she said. I daresay she does. An _undocumented immigrant_ is just a new American waiting for paperwork; an _illegal alien_ is wanted by the FBI and wants to probe you. A _foreign person who works shit jobs because e lacks the basic protections of the law_ sounds best to me.
&gt; If for no other reason, don't start lying...   &gt; it's too easy to slip up and start lying to yourself. Is this the reason not to lie?  Because it is some kind of 'gateway act' into the real depravity of lying to yourself?  I would need a better reason than that.  But really, your lecture on ethics has turned into pleading.  I agree lying is damaging most of the time, but there is a time and place for everything.  It is a tool just like any other evolved behavior, and sometimes it is necessary to survive.  In this case however, anyone who buys a TV at best buy it doesn't matter how much they swindle them out of it they are throwing their money into a pit of evil.  But really, does the side of truth really need to beg?  Your analysis is telling:  what unseen internal lie are you displacing your venom on?
To be honest, this has nothing to do with the "fuck" word.  It has everything to do with people freaking out for now reason.

Our freedoms are being taking away without any sort of resistance, and the ones who take it are taking without any hesitation whatsoever. Oh, and fuck that lawsuit.

&gt; Ideally perhaps real number support, though stuff like that is more likely to pop up in haskell-land. Really real real number support has the disadvantage of being halting-problem hard. Think about checking for equality, for instance; if two numbers are unequal, then there will eventually be a digit in which they differ, so equality checking will terminate for them. On the other hand, imagine computing the same number by two distinct methods (e.g. using two different formulas for pi) and checking for equality. There just isn't a way to do this by looking at digits in the general case, because you'd need to check infinitely many of them. The only way is to have each number carry around its "expression structure" and use a theorem prover to verify or falsify the identity relating the two expressions--essentially what Mathematica and Maple do. But theorem proving in the real numbers is at least as hard as the halting problem. That isn't to say that there aren't vastly better approximations to real numbers than floating-point arithmetic provides. I think even finite-precision fixed-point arithmetic is preferable in a lot of cases where floats are currently in use. And you can of course have arbitrary-precision fixed-point arithmetic too.
You're right.  The reason anti-gay marriage laws are legal is because they apply equally to everyone.  The truth is, gay people have the same rights in the US as non gay people.  The comment about interracial marriage is a valid one, but there are plenty of limitations on marriage.  You can't marry your close relative, you can't marry more than one person, etc.  Gay marriage is just one of of many types of marriage that are illegal.

It doesn't make a big difference.  &gt;the fact that the majority voted against renewing the law shows that they didn't want it I may have misinterpreted it, but I took you comment as stating that the majority, lead by the Liberals, didn't want these laws in the first place (when they were first introduced)- I was just pointing out that this isn't the case. I do find it funny, however, the things the liberals criticize the Conservatives for. This is one example. And even better one is Afghanistan. The liberals were the ones who sent our soldiers there and committed them to helping to rebuild the country. However, the minute they were out of power the Liberals started screaming bloody murder that we had troops in Afghanistan, even though it is because of them that they are there and are committed for the next few years. Sorry, I can't stand the liberals (I'm from Alberta, so that could explain it;))
&gt; This pipeline was essentially for Pakistan and Turkmenistan and was key to getting trillions in oil transported. Trillions is more than Afghanistans GDP for many centuries. Hardly a "piddly affair". **Trillions** in oil from a country with a [$25 billion total GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Turkmenistan), yeah right! And it's no new market either. Turkmen oil and gas has been exported to the Soviet Union for decades. In any case, surely the Bush/Carlyle/Zionists couldn't give a rats ass about Afghanistan's GDP. The amount of oil that was projected to go through the pipeline was minuscule by *American* standards. Just look how little effort went into pursuing the idea since the invasion compared to the efforts to get Iraqi oil supply up and running. But back to your 'who benefits' view of the world. Since you are the conspiracy connoisseur, tell me why my theory of Musharaff as the bad guy is less plausible than your ZOG scenario. Or are they *all* in it together.

I'm going to say he wants to be spanked by a big strong man for being such a naughty boy, but can't handle his feelings so he's externalizing the anger he feels at himself.

Maybe you need to read some history on foreign policy, its more like [mafia relations](http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/3999 "here").  How about "Confessions of an Economic Hitman".  The Jackals were called in. Pakistan agreed to go along long as we don't go against them, and they got nuclear allowances and defense deals.  http://reddit.com/info/175ci/comments Believe what you want to believe.  Trillions alone goes through that pipeline that did get built.  Not the cost of the pipeline, over time the pipeline delivers alot more than $25 million in oil, more into the trillions annually and is key in securing economy by controlling the energy resources. Try this thread:  http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=osama_bin_laden Don't even get me started on BCCI bank:  http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=bank_of_credit_and_commerce_international &gt;...couldn't give a rats ass about Afghanistan's GDP. Exactly, the pipeline was worth more in the economic balance of things in one day than Afghanistan for centuries.  I am not against economy I am just one who cares to look deeper.  It only helps when you want to know markets. The pipeline is to connect the Caspian Sea which countries around it will be using, the Pentagon predicts that a majority of non OPEC oil will come from there/Russia.  That is alot of oil, non-OPEC is 70% of our consumption. http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/oil.html To deny immense benefits to the ones in power and the ends means for economic benefit when it happened is just silly and well naive...

What's funny is that the Democrats as a party gave him an offical counter point speech which he just ignored; probably because it was weak counter statement and more concilliary than the point he wanted to make...  He is definitely just what the democrats need

I still don't really see why we needed new planes when the F15 and F14 were doing just fine. It's not like terrorists have planes to counter ours... This is akin to replacing the M16 with something new and untested. I guess the main reason is to line defense industry execs with more money....

It is also (much as interracial marriage was) one whose illegality is completely arbitrary and groundless.
Thankfully, civil liberties don't exist as physical entities, so they can't blow them up. Not that they haven't tried to ERASE them, but...
&gt; Gays have a right to get married that is identical to that of non-gays. So if men were only allowed to marry men and women were only allowed to marry women, you'd be okay with that too, right?  Because it's "identical".

Coupons are perfectly fine. That's when the business is being up front and showing you what they're offering. But bundling is where they're supposedly selling one thing, but really they're just pushing something else.  Bundling is frowned on and sometimes outlawed because managers use it to pump up the sales of products that are too weak to survive on their own.  Also, if they then say something is out of stock? Not legal. Bundling at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundling_%28marketing%29

What I actually did was to buy a 500 Gb external hard drive for $199.  While comparing hard drive prices, I stopped to consider how incredibly far hard drive prices have fallen over the years.  Compared to the first hard drive I bought (in 1990) I was getting a windfall no matter what modern hard drive I bought.  The stats are amazing.

The shortest route for pipelines from Caspian Sea is through IRAN to the Persian Gulf.  They had to go through Afghanistan because they couldn't go through IRAQ or IRAN.

Well, you can certainly post whatever you like, but I will downmod posts that don't include content that's worth reading.  Since the text is only (officially) available if you pay for the book, the page you posted is really nothing more than an advertisment for the book.

What in my statement suggested that it had anything to do with her connections to the Bush family.  What I WAS implying, is that she obviously came from a well connected family.  Do you honestly think any Bushie would marry a nobody?

This was covered a month ago on reddit but.... Not true, the bill does not allow the takeover of state law enforcement(ie. the police) but does allow the takeover of the state National Guard.  He already mostly had this power anyway and this bill constituted only a slight expansion of that power. &gt; Congress changed the Insurrection Act to list "natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident" &gt; A bipartisan majority of both chambers of Congress adopted the change  &gt; Backers of the new rules, including U.S. Sens.

The Representative echoes my thoughts very acutely.  What will our children think?  Why have we waited this long?

What you're talking about is docetism which was one of the interpretations of Gnostic teachings. However, most Gnostics believed that there was an otherworldly realm where the Savior's sacrifice took place. You can read about all that in Elaine Pagel's books.

It is interesting.  I'd like to have a room like that myself.
total cock. Sorry. Bukowski wrote some interesting fiction, fun to read, and it's pretty good, knowing the situation he was in and where he was coming from.  I'm glad that a blue collar writer could make it. His poetry?  I don't know what people are so on about that.  I feel like his fiction was written when he was a little more coherent, and the poetry was when he was too drunk to do anything else and bored.
Liberals?

Its because who can't love Layton's sweet 'stache? I can't stand the guy (never mind the party), but I love that sweet facial hair. Seriously though, the reason that the NDP comes off as being the nice guy is because they have no chance whatsoever of winning an election anytime soon.
Interesting. But I want to know their methodology to estimate anyone's IQ beyond 200. If the mean of the IQ test is 100, then the first standard deviations are somewhere around 131 and 69. Any scores outside that range should just be labeled as such. The IQ test is not an accurate measure of intelligence anyway.

Well my particular comment was in a different discussion saying that Paul never believed Jesus existed because Paul was a gnostic.  So, I was trying to show that Paul probably at least believed Jesus existed--not to mention interacted with people who also not only believed but were eye-witnesses.  Plus, I think to say that because Paul never met Jesus means he is not a creditable source is kind of a hard line since he existed in the same time and had obviously at least heard about Jesus.  His testimony seems as relevant as any other extra-Biblical source and is good enough for most ancient near eastern historians.  But we both agree on the main point I was trying to make in the other discussion--that Paul believed Jesus existed.
I suppose that how well that works depends on how evenly those balls are weighted. It's possible that some balls are more likely to come up than others, but I doubt that knowledge of that changes the expected return much at all. I guess it's the smartest way to do something stupid.
Didn't the chapter actually conclude that they weren't a hindrance?

&gt;Mr. BEREUTER. I would like to proceed to the subject of the hearing for today, U.S. interests in the Central Asian Republics. I do have a statement. One hundred years ago, Central Asia was the arena for a great game played by Czarist Russia, Colonial Britain, Napoleon's France, and the Persian and the Ottoman Empires. Allegiances meant little during this struggle for empire building, where no single empire could gain the upper hand. **One hundred years later, the collapse of the Soviet Union has unleashed a new great game, where the interests of the East India Trading Company have been replaced by those of Unocal and Total, and many other organizations and firms.**

Maybe, but it doesn't look like it in the photos. In the second photo, in particular, the "iLC" label can be seen through the wall; and there doesn't seem to be a second layer of wall material in front of it.

I mean you can't win, really.  People who were eye-witnesses are obviously going to be seen as biased.  And those who didn't know him are immediately discredited.   But, like others have mentioned, it's hard to think that a lot would have been written about someone who, originally, played a small role in a remote corner of the Roman empire.  I think if we apply the same historical tests that we do for other figures Jesus's existence seems to stand up.   But, to play devil's advocate, maybe his existence was fabricated, and he never did exist.  That would make it a highly-successful work of wild fiction ( God has a son, son becomes man, man dies, rises again--that type of thing was an extremely hard sell to both Jews and Greeks at the time)  with original followers willing to face persecution and death to make it convincing.  Or, perhaps, Jesus was just a man who had a following and they really wanted to believe he was the Messiah so much they filled in the missing pieces after his death.  That seems at least more plausible, but then you're back to the idea that he really did exist. I think if you take it backwards--how did we get to here--and if you go all the way back you have these gospels, epistles, and secular documents written pretty closely to the time when Jesus was supposed to have existed.  If it were any other person people would accept that, because not only do you have the writings, you have the end result, a by-product that came from somewhere--Christianity.   If you assume the author's intent (in the gospels and epistles) was to prove Jesus's divinity, and you marked all of those passages as questionable, it's still pretty certain that the non-divine person existed. The motivation of the writers and whether or not they sensationalized is one thing, even modern historians are guilty of that, but no one would question that the person probably did exist.  It's the unfortunate fact that he's tied to a religious movement that make it very hard to accurately look at his life.  Ironic.  :)

Oh, puh-leese, you know it's deceptive because you have to make such a convoluted argument for how it's not.

Good, I needed a place to practice markdown... thanks! http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics.text Markdown: Basics  ================ &lt;ul id="ProjectSubmenu"&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown Project Page"&gt;Main&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="selected" title="Markdown Basics"&gt;Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown Syntax Documentation"&gt;Syntax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/projects/markdown/license" title="Pricing and License Information"&gt;License&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/projects/markdown/dingus" title="Online Markdown Web Form"&gt;Dingus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;   Getting the Gist of Markdown's Formatting Syntax  ------------------------------------------------ This page offers a brief overview of what it's like to use Markdown.  The [syntax page] [s] provides complete, detailed documentation for  every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by  looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page  are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the  HTML output produced by Markdown. It's also helpful to simply try Markdown out; the [Dingus] [d] is a  web application that allows you type your own Markdown-formatted text  and translate it to XHTML. **Note:** This document is itself written using Markdown; you  can [see the source for it by adding '.text' to the URL] [src].   [s]: /projects/markdown/syntax  "Markdown Syntax" [d]: /projects/markdown/dingus  "Markdown Dingus" [src]: /projects/markdown/basics.text   ## Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes ## A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated  by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like  a blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is  considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with  spaces or tabs. Markdown offers two styles of headers: *Setext* and *atx*.  Setext-style headers for `&lt;h1&gt;` and `&lt;h2&gt;` are created by  "underlining" with equal signs (`=`) and hyphens (`-`), respectively.  To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (`#`) at the  beginning of the line -- the number of hashes equals the resulting  HTML header level. Blockquotes are indicated using email-style '`&gt;`' angle brackets. Markdown:  A First Level Header   ====================   A Second Level Header   ---------------------  Now is the time for all good men to come to   the aid of their country. This is just a   regular paragraph.  The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy   dog's back.   ### Header 3  &gt; This is a blockquote.   &gt;    &gt; This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.   &gt;   &gt; ## This is an H2 in a blockquote   Output:  &lt;h1&gt;A First Level Header&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;A Second Level Header&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now is the time for all good men to come to   the aid of their country. This is just a   regular paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy   dog's back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3&gt;Header 3&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;h2&gt;This is an H2 in a blockquote&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;/blockquote&gt;  ### Phrase Emphasis ### Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis. Markdown:  Some of these words *are emphasized*.   Some of these words _are emphasized also_.   Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.   Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__. Output:  &lt;p&gt;Some of these words &lt;em&gt;are emphasized&lt;/em&gt;.   Some of these words &lt;em&gt;are emphasized also&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Use two asterisks for &lt;strong&gt;strong emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;.   Or, if you prefer, &lt;strong&gt;use two underscores instead&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;     ## Lists ## Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,  `+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are  interchangable; this:  *   Candy.   *   Gum.   *   Booze. this:  +   Candy.   +   Gum.   +   Booze. and this:  -   Candy.   -   Gum.   -   Booze. all produce the same output:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Candy.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Gum.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Booze.&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ul&gt; Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as  list markers:  1.  Red   2.  Green   3.  Blue Output:  &lt;ol&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ol&gt; If you put blank lines between items, you'll get `&lt;p&gt;` tags for the  list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting  the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:  *   A list item.    With multiple paragraphs.  *   Another item in the list. Output:  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list item.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With multiple paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another item in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;/ul&gt;   ### Links ### Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and  *reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the  text you want to turn into a link. Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.  For example:  This is an [example link](http://example.com/). Output:  &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="http://example.com/"&gt;   example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:  This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title"). Output:  &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="http://example.com/" title="With a Title"&gt;   example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which  you define elsewhere in your document:  I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from   [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].  [1]: http://google.com/  "Google"   [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"   [3]: http://search.msn.com/ "MSN Search" Output:  &lt;p&gt;I get 10 times more traffic from &lt;a href="http://google.com/"   title="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; than from &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/"   title="Yahoo Search"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://search.msn.com/"   title="MSN Search"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,  numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:  I start my morning with a cup of coffee and   [The New York Times][NY Times].  [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/ Output:  &lt;p&gt;I start my morning with a cup of coffee and   &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   ### Images ### Image syntax is very much like link syntax. Inline (titles are optional):  ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title") Reference-style:  ![alt text][id]  [id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title" Both of the above examples produce the same output:  &lt;img src="/path/to/img.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Title" /&gt;  ### Code ### In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in  backtick quotes. Any ampersands (`&amp;`) and angle brackets (`&lt;` or  `&gt;`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes  it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:  I strongly recommend against using any `&lt;blink&gt;` tags.  I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&amp;mdash;`   instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&amp;#8212;`. Output:  &lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend against using any   &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wish SmartyPants used named entities like   &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/code&gt; instead of decimal-encoded   entites like &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#8212;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of  the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&amp;`, `&lt;`,  and `&gt;` characters will be escaped automatically. Markdown:  If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,   you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:   &lt;blockquote&gt;     &lt;p&gt;For example.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/blockquote&gt; Output:  &lt;p&gt;If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,   you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; 
"(almost indistinguishable in buzz)" There is either something wrong with you or the substances you were ingesting.  They are more similar than say, weed and cocaine, but as far as psychedelics go they are VERY distinct and easily distinguishable.
Are you saying your grandmother isn't worthy of being upmodded? That is sad, man... what ever happened to respecting your elders? I would *totally* up-mod your grandma.
&gt; Renouncing Islam can carry the death penalty in a number of countries including Iran, Saudi-Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan and Mauritania. Note that's not for blasphemy or sacrilege - simply for choosing to renounce the religion that your parents believed in. Think of that when you say that the US has become a theocracy
5-10 years ago there was a big news story about a record-winning $100+ million jackpot that, one year later (the deadline for claiming your winnings), no one had claimed. They were surprised when, a couple of days later, it turned up, mailed in via regular old first-class mail, postmarked on the last possible day. Of course the rules said you could just mail in your winning ticket as long as it was postmarked by the last possible date, but who would be crazy enough to drop such a valuable item in the mail? When they finally interviewed the guy, he had basically realized that he had the winning ticket right away, and had spent the next year working his regular job and leading his normal life, figuring out who his true friends were. That guy, I'm sure, is still rich. Unlike all [these people](http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/SaveMoney/8lotteryWinnersWhoLostTheirMillions.aspx).

reddit's not blocked, I read it daily. In fact I can reach most of these sites - the only ones that regularly (and noticeably) break are news.bbc.co.uk, cnn.com, wordpress.com and en.wikipedia.org (so use answers.com instead..). Chinese internet filtering is performed at local office, ISP, provincial and international exchange level, each with different sites, so mileage varies a lot. This list is much longer than what I've found to be true!

Paragraphs, Headers, Blockquotes A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs. Markdown offers two styles of headers: Setext and atx. Setext-style headers for &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;h2&gt; are created by “underlining” with equal signs (=) and hyphens (-), respectively. To create an atx-style header, you put 1-6 hash marks (#) at the beginning of the line — the number of hashes equals the resulting HTML header level. Blockquotes are indicated using email-style ‘&gt;’ angle brackets. Markdown: A First Level Header  ==================== A Second Level Header  --------------------- Now is the time for all good men to come to  the aid of their country. This is just a  regular paragraph. The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy  dog's back. ### Header 3 &gt; This is a blockquote.  &gt;   &gt; This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.  &gt;  &gt; ## This is an H2 in a blockquote Output: &lt;h1&gt;A First Level Header&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A Second Level Header&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now is the time for all good men to come to  the aid of their country. This is just a  regular paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy  dog's back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Header 3&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;This is an H2 in a blockquote&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; Phrase Emphasis Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis. Markdown: Some of these words *are emphasized*.  Some of these words _are emphasized also_. Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.  Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__. Output: &lt;p&gt;Some of these words &lt;em&gt;are emphasized&lt;/em&gt;.  Some of these words &lt;em&gt;are emphasized also&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use two asterisks for &lt;strong&gt;strong emphasis&lt;/strong&gt;.  Or, if you prefer, &lt;strong&gt;use two underscores instead&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Lists Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (*, +, and -) as list markers. These three markers are interchangable; this: *   Candy.  *   Gum.  *   Booze. this: +   Candy.  +   Gum.  +   Booze. and this: -   Candy.  -   Gum.  -   Booze. all produce the same output: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Candy.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gum.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Booze.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers: 1.  Red  2.  Green  3.  Blue Output: &lt;ol&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ol&gt; If you put blank lines between items, you’ll get &lt;p&gt; tags for the list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab: *   A list item.  With multiple paragraphs. *   Another item in the list. Output: &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list item.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With multiple paragraphs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another item in the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt; Links Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link. Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text. For example: This is an [example link](http://example.com/). Output: &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="http://example.com/"&gt;  example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses: This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title"). Output: &lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="http://example.com/" title="With a Title"&gt;  example link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document: I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from  [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3]. [1]: http://google.com/  "Google"  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"  [3]: http://search.msn.com/ "MSN Search" Output: &lt;p&gt;I get 10 times more traffic from &lt;a href="http://google.com/"  title="Google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; than from &lt;a href="http://search.yahoo.com/"  title="Yahoo Search"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://search.msn.com/"  title="MSN Search"&gt;MSN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters, numbers and spaces, but are not case sensitive: I start my morning with a cup of coffee and  [The New York Times][NY Times]. [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/ Output: &lt;p&gt;I start my morning with a cup of coffee and  &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; Images Image syntax is very much like link syntax. Inline (titles are optional): ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title") Reference-style: ![alt text][id] [id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title" Both of the above examples produce the same output: &lt;img src="/path/to/img.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Title" /&gt; Code In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in backtick quotes. Any ampersands (&amp;) and angle brackets (&lt; or &gt;) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code: I strongly recommend against using any `&lt;blink&gt;` tags.

Also allow the correction of typos and outright factual errors in the title. I ask for this because I'm embarassed to have made such stupid errors and am currently unable to correct the problem.

I like my Vista PC, even if it does have problems. Comparing it to ME is complete and utter BS because ME was Crash Central. Vista has zero crashes on me, it has some great features. The only problem I have run into is compatibility and a little annoyance adjusting to the new interface. That's it. By the time the first service pack comes around this is a non-issue. Shit like this annoys the hell outta me.
This project actually seems pretty doable, up until the point where he throws in that crap about the user entering a serial number. Talk about impossible!

Yeh I just don't know about the offline craze though. Its rare anyone is offline anymore when on a computer and users are going to want to insert a web image, or search the database, or insert a google map into an email etc.  People just don't write with no web there that often.  I don't think other than offline tasks its going to be successful much.  Just a cool feature to add to the comparison charts over competitors

It's amazing how often these guys cut fiber connections.  I used to run ISPs, and in the five years that I was doing that, we'd have a cable cut by a backhoe at least once a year at one of our POPs.  One time they cut a 500 pair POTS cable HAHAHA.  It took them days to put it all back together.   
"If the mean of the IQ test is 100, then the first standard deviations are somewhere around 131 and 69."   You can not deduce anything about the Standard Deviation from its mean.  That is the whole friggin point by the way.   The SD is 15 or 16 depending on Wechsler or Stanford Binet scale.  (the tests are made to achieve those numbers)

We agree so much it's scary that I call myself a contrarian :-) But since the market hasnt priced all of this in, I guess I still am. My brother is on the mortgage side of things (MBS salesmen) - his info is interesting and scary. Defaults are sky rocketing, foreclosures are just starting to increase, and we havent even seen the bulk of the ARM resets.  ABX is moving, and not in the open direction. All this while rates arent exactly "high" and implied M3 is still growing. As for debts - I'm clear of USD debt nearly completely except that needed to keep the bills paid.    The Yen has been overissued, but I think the overissuance is fundementally different from the US overissuance. The Yen is probably the most undervalued major currency, and Japanese assets are probably the cheapest major asset class in the world. Obviously, IMO. The Yen was the biggest beneficiary of yesterdays move, and man, that was a suprise to see - the Yen acting as a safehaven. Btw - to those who think that nothing was happening yesterday - that Yen move was out of the ordinary. It's been a rare sight to see. It happened ALL DAY LONG, and was seperate from all normal moves in the market.   Godspeed cypress-hill!
No. If you're going to hang around in the real world, you have to be prepared to take criticism and ridicule for your silly beliefs. You wouldn't face nearly as much ridicule if the religions you're defending weren't such a threat to world peace, but while the worlds leaders are claiming a god given right to wage war, I'll claim my self-given right to say whatever the hell I like. I'll bet it doesn't hurt half as much as losing your family to a bombing raid....
agree??!??
The title is a dismal reflection of English grammar today. The proper title should be "New York City bans use of the word 'nigger'".  Instead we have a title that, in a grammatical English reading, postulates the existence of an entity called the "word nigger". I know little to nothing about a "word nigger" nor about NYC's choice to ban "use" of this individual, nor whether that is a good or bad thing.  And what will NYC do with their library copies of Joseph Conrad's  novel "The Nigger of the Narcissus"?
I can't get even close with any NBA or MLB team rosters.  If you get anything at all it tends to be sort of random lists of stars from different eras.

Except that, ltbarcly, being the fucking idiot that he is, can't keep straight which child is which.  DaShawn, when he was 8, squirmed too much for the one dentist who would even see him.  Deamonte, his older brother, is the one who died of a tooth infection. My kid squirmed too much for his first dentist.  We had good insurance.  We found another dentist who was better with kids.
Yes, I read the article and saw those. It just further convinces me that this wasn't just an issue of being uninsured.
I'm not sure why this is a story. The kind of people who can manage such winnings intelligently just don't play the lottery as often as schmucks who don't understand basic probability. Finally we have a semi-intelligent winner (even though his strategy leaves something to be desired) -- it's not like he devised some amazing plan to escape the inevitable vortex that lottery winnings always suck you into. There's just a lot more schmucks playing the lottery out there so they tend to be the winners and hence why we hear countless stories of millions squandered.

&gt;The brain signature is relatively uneventful when we understand the meaning of a word but when the word changes the grammar of the whole sentence, brain readings suddenly peak. The brain is then forced to retrace its thinking process in order to understand what it is supposed to make of this unusual word. I suppose listening to G.W. Bush also has a dramatic effect on human brain...

Thanks for your comment Bvowk. Sorry for the tardy reply - but I'm in central europe, so the sun is only rising.  :o) Yes, we have interbred and 'created' many variations of dog. But, again, they are still canines. People have even crossed a Tiger with a Lion - making a 'Liger', but they're both still cats. The age old process of improving fruit and vegetables through 'overseeing natural selection' is one thing, but mixing species is another. ""...we are told that: "Research scientists can now precisely identify the individual gene that governs a desired trait, extract it, copy it and isert the copy into another organism. Taht organism (and its offspring) will then have the desired trait.." "This reaffirms the genetic determinist idea that one gene controls one character trait, and that transferring the gene results in the transfer of the corresponding trait to th egenetically modified organism, which can then pass it on indefinitely to future generations. It presents the process of genetic modification as a precise and simple operation. "The above account - so typical of that found in publications promoting 'public understandin' - is based on a simplistic assumption of genetics that both classical geneticists and plant breeders have rejected for amny years, and which has been thoroughly invalidated by all the research findings in the new genetics.... Unfortunately, most molecular geneticists, apart from being absorbed into industry, also lack training in classical genetics, and suffer from a severe molecular myopia that prevents them from appreciating the implications and broader perspective of the findings in their own discipline." - Genetic Engineering, Dream or Nightmare? The Brave New World of Bad Science and Big Business. Dr. Mae-Wan Ho, p. 130,131. Many of the scientists that are wielding the microscope are conscientiously singleminded in their concern for 1) gaining recognition, and 2) fulfilling their responsibilities for their employer. As my original post mentioned - "Scientists have no equivalent of the Hippocratic Oath". I don't think we can afford to be so cavalier with the building blocks of life? It is human pride in its most dangerous form.

Hold on - Oil and Gas hasnt exactly been ganbusters since 2005. Muni-bonds are great for the tax benefit, but staying in USD is probably the worst idea ever. And Real Estate? Unless he means REITs in parts of Asia or Europe, that hasnt exactly been doing all that well either. His idea's right on and I applaud him for that - but he needs better places for his money than where its currently at. At least, in my opinion.
Hey, congratulations on making it to the top story on reddit!
"Mistakes, we dont make mistakes" - Bill, from Dept. of Public Works Right before he finds they 'switched back to metric again'
Of course, can't the same abuse happen on reddit? However -- I often only use the 'recommended' section for reading.  I see alot of stuff that doesn't float to the top of 'new' because of my voting history.  But massive downvoting of certain kinds of new stories probably would sink it from the 'recommended' section, too.
So what should I feel? Should I feel my government should step into a conflict that it has nothing to do with? I don't. Knowing this, does it really matter if I feel bad for them?  Me saying, "Oh, thats terrible" isn't going to help or hurt them. Of course, we should all worry about other countries rather then our own.  That makes perfect sense.

Dude, please put down the minarchist crack pipe.  I'm a libertarian. I vote for libertarian candidates when they're not insane (c.f. Rick Stanley).  I accept the argument that any State action relies in the end upon violent force.  That doesn't mean that there's no place for the State. Guess what, you're already compelled (with the threat of violent force, even) to pay for a police force.  I'm suggesting a way to improve that situation. Yes, there are minarchist schemes wherein there is no government at all: each of us could choose to subscribe to a justice company, and a law enforcement company, and a fire company, and a road-laying company, and a water company, and so on and so forth.  David Friedman has written very well on the subject.  Be that as it may, I am about 95% convinced that it cannot work and 5% convinced that we have that situation currently: my justice and law enforcement company is the city, which contracts with the county, which contracts with the state, which contracts with the federal government, which contracts with various foreign justice and law enforcement companies. &gt; Put up or shut up; I'll not be your town watch for you. Of course, I _am_ putting up: I'm proposing to be subject to the same watch levy.  Moreover, I am putting up by proposing to live in a corporation which exacts such a payment from its citizens.  You're free to move down the road to another such corporation. So, how praytell do you propose to replace our current suite of State-provided services?  Please be complete and detailed in your answer, including answers to such natural monopolies as last-mile infrastructure, as well as how exactly the interaction of the various private justice systems should work.
My favourite error message was from a very, very, very long session of Dungeon Siege. The server eventually started doing bizzare things, and finally popped up a dialog box, "Argh. Me go sleep now." I've always wondered whether it was the software that was tired, or the programmer...
Thanks. It's looking like Python is going to be the winner. Lots to recommend it over the others. I'll blog about it when I get a chance.
I had that too, but someody just copied the site and put it in PDF. This is first legal PDF from apress.
Again, I have to say, that is awesome. To me it sounds like you're going to throw a sick person, which of course, makes it even cooler.
George W. Bush's IQ is *not* 125. More like 98.
great article
What part of "terrorists don't have airplanes don't you understand"? Did Osama hijack a F117? Last I heard passenger aircraft don't shoot back. O yeah read up on stealth aircraft drawbacks:  http://www.answers.com/topic/stealth-aircraft Besides stealth detection is nothing new:  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/21/readers_turn_searchlight_on_stealth/ After the end of the cold war, most military spending (battleships, planes, ...) is no different from pork barrel projects... in terms of new weapons and equipment we need to focus more on personnel stuff like new guns and troop armor.

Like I said above we had 2 last week. One to a pile driver during construction, and the other was under a pile of scrap metal so big that it deformed the earth and snapped the conduit. The scrap would have taken a week to move, so Aruba came to the rescue with a wireless bridge.
Not.  Why medicate everyone?  That's basically what adding fluoride to the water supply does.  If you want fluoride then buy flouride toothpaste (it's cheap) or even get fluoride tabs for the kiddies.  But don't force an industrial waste on all of us. Gee... a lot of folks are depressed;  Let's just add Prozac to the water supply.   (Oh, and come to think of it, how many kids actually drink tap water anymore?  Most of 'em are drinking some kind of soft drink or juice)

Twice a hero.
I think you mean anarchist (or anarcho-capitalist), not minarchist.  Minarchism accepts a minimal state.  Like David Friedman, I do not. &gt; David Friedman has written very well on the subject. Perhaps you should actually read him.  He does a much better job of giving a detailed response to your question in his [book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machinery_of_Freedom) than I could possibly service in a simple reddit comment.  It's simply beyond the scope of this medium.  You should also take a look at [this recent compilation](http://www.mises.org/store/Anarchy-and-Law-P335C1.aspx) which contains the writings of most of the major thinkers on this subject, including David. &gt; my justice and law enforcement company is the city, which contracts with the county, which contracts with the state, which contracts with the federal government, which contracts with various foreign justice and law enforcement companies. Yet all of those organizations have effectively *monopoly control* over their given territorial area, and they maintain that monopoly through violence rather than competition.  That would be the difference between a market-based system of justice and protection and what exists currently.  Look up "polycentric law." &gt; Of course, I am putting up: I'm proposing to be subject to the same watch levy. Moreover, I am putting up by proposing to live in a corporation which exacts such a payment from its citizens. You're free to move down the road to another such corporation. You presume this "corporation" (government) owns the property I live on.  Where exactly did it get that title?  I'm the one who lives here, not them.  I dispute the ethical legitimacy of any claim they have over my money for the purposes of funding their protection racket. Anyway.  My point is that you're replacing one system of tyranny with another.  The police state is a system for the enforcement of the State's claim to monopoly power over their chosen territorial region.  And don't get me wrong, I can certainly see the advantages if officers of the State were chosen randomly from the citizenry rather than simply appointed by those already in power.  But it's a step towards improvement *at the cost of* implementing a whole new system of control, with its own chances for abuse.  And it will *still* ultimately be managed by those in power. A market for law already exists.  Private protection agencies are a first tiny step in a mostly right direction.  So your suggestion for conscripted watchmen is not only harmful, but ultimately irrelevant (I'm 99% convinced it is will never happen).  What we should focus on is making sure this burgeoning system of private law enforcement moves in the *right* direction towards replacing the current system of tyranny with a more voluntary system - rather than turning into its own system of tyranny, which I admit is not outside the realm of possibility.

I wonder if we'll even recognize artificial intelligence when it emerges; I suspect it will have motivations alien to human ones. "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim."  -- Edsger W. Dijkstra
I recall him saying something along the lines of "Close, but his eyes are blue." It's meant to be a touching account of the Prophet's close relationship with Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - he even knows what color his EYES are!  The fact that you have to turn off your brain to fall for it is minor.
Woah that's crazy! He has some pretty damn good self control.

The act lost. Almost everything they've tried to do that has been (in my opinion) stupid, has been destroyed by all of the other parties. You can't really say they're in power. They won the most seats, sure, but they didn't really win the driver's seat. I don't think we truly have anything to fear from them. Now the conservatives in a majority, that worries me.

This mud had a large influence on designs I thought of, later, and directly made me want to create a more smaug-like mud that had, in addition to the normal combat-oriented classes, also social classes that could in coordination have as much power as a mud 'implementor'.  Lots of class-related power seperation, some powers that only work in the presence of a political advantage. I didn't notice the negative connotation until now, however.

Evidently, code has half-life, too.
So what's the theory here, that they decided to use explosives to bring down the building (8 hours after the attack on the WTC) and they called the BBC and told them ahead of time?  To what possible end? My guess is that that was around the time the NYFD realized the building was definitely coming down in the near future, moved everyone back away from the building, and somehow the message was jumbled when communicated to the news media.  Just like a *lot* of messages are screwed up in disasters (and non-disasters for that matter).
Even the white guys have NFL-sounding names. Joe Montana, Dan Marino.
Of course, due to the complete lack of polymorphism, it's really pretty hard to see from this code why the monad abstraction itself might be interesting. This is only the maybe monad, and only applied at the int type. On the other hand, implementing the sort of polymorphism required to really get across the monad abstraction in C with explicit passing of dictionaries for bind and return would likely end up looking kind of nuts and result in all but unreadable code when actually put to use. Still, it might be interesting to see.

In a great [Interview, here](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/12/23), (short writeup - [actual mp3 here](http://media.skybuilders.com/Lydon/vidal.mp3))  Gore Vidal predicted at the end of 2003 that this American republic would fall:  &gt; In our conversation in Cambridge, ... I asked him, as the novelist of Empire, whether the plunge in these Bush years from republic to empire was now irreversible. "Well," Vidal replied, "I think Gibbon would say: no. It's highly reversible. And try to step aside when the Capitol falls on you. Ours will go as the others have gone." At the time Vidal sounded nuttily extreme, the craziness of an old man who was too self-indulgent in his pessimism. But now he looks far-sighted. Anyway, the interview is a good acompaniment to this piece. It's pessimistic, but he's smart, and knows his history. He talks mostly about the Founding Fathers, but also the growth of empire in the 20th century.
The aspects of this story that are most interesting are his complete lack of understanding of mathematical probability and the potential for his "system" to motivate equally inept folks to make unintelligent financial decisions by blowing their money on Powerball.

I've been using the del.icio.us 'your network' functionality as an alternative source of information for a while now, and I'd like to expand it a bit with some extra people.

Yeah, I don't really like the RealWorld -&gt; (t, RealWorld) analogy for the reason that RealWorld can't really exist, and even if it does in some token form, one has to be terribly careful in order not to duplicate the world. (Clean takes the approach of proving that you don't using uniqueness types.) It seems much simpler to me to regard a value of type (IO t) as simply representing a program which when executed may interact with the world before producing a value of type t. Evaluation won't cause any of this execution to occur (but the runtime system will eventually cause main to be executed).

The most important one - "you are rational and _right_". No matter who you are, what education you have, and what society you live in - you are not rational and you are wrong most of the time. Your mind is weak and you just took sides on different issues. The way people "stand" on different issues is quite similar to rooting to different sport teams.
Exactly.  I don't know why people are attempting to 'rationally discuss' a fairy-tale character...
Keith Lemon, is that you?
The articles states why coders get paid "far too little".  Thre reason is exactly that the quality of the coders, in general, has little to do with the financial success of the company.  Coders who are good enough to turn their skillz into money make money.  If you can write the cleanest, most fully optimized, highest quality wazoo that is simply immaculate, and the world doesn't need wazoos, then your just a wazoo.  Trust me - I like to pay my coders based on their ability to contribute, but "ability to code" and "ability to contribute to the success of the product" are two different things entirely.
We already have air superiority with the last generation of aircraft; and it didn't cost as much as the current gen. Moreover with current gen planes, their biggest strength is also their biggest weakness. To achieve stealth, the current gen plane designs had to give up some aerodynamic stability and manueverability... Basically what this means is that once a last gen plane catches up, the stealth plane is at a disadvantage. What you'll probably say now is that, "well stealth planes can shoot way before they're detected". Unfortunately with stealth detection devices now operational, this doesn't bode well...

Again, I'm not saying you are wrong or the article is in this particular case, I just think you know nothing more than I do on the subject, so you have no idea of the cost of the oil extraction. "Somewhat more mature" doesn't mean anything, and actually, the more mature the fields are and the more oil recuperation will cost (due to fluid pressure considerations). As for the technical challenges, I don't know what particular field in Saudi Arabia you're talking about (I guess none in particular as maybe you think the cost is the same for all fields...) but I have studied some fields in this country where oil recovering is indeed a real technical challenge. And it's definitely not a "matter of punching a hole into the reservoir"...   So plze mister I know everything, if the article doesn't convince you, and you feel like it's misinformative, you can say so, but don't bring some even worse and less factual based arguments to make your point. Thx in advance.
Naive question - will these DST settings work only for years starting with now? If I do "calendar arithmetics" for previous years will "old" DST settings be used? But yeah, the whole DST is a mess in IT (most important issue is that at 3AM the clock is moved back 1 hour and you specify 2:30AM what value in "epoch" seconds should that be?)
I don't know that Wyoming is any more special than any other predominantly rural locale -- one where you will inevitably find a higher percentage of the population that is insecure or obsessed with the facade of masculinity and otherwise naturally predisposed to xenophobia. The setting makes this representatives' stance at least slightly more admirable, perhaps even moreso given the recent threat to the Marlboro Man image posed by director Ang Lee. A particular point made by Zwonitzer about the opponents of the civil rights movements of the 60s continues to resonate: "...how could society feel this way, only 40 years ago?" The massive advances in technology in the 20th century give a false sense of distance from generations that are still alive, some still ruling, that continue to think this way -- thanks in no small part to the religious right. The Church (of whatever stripe) has always been dragged kicking and screaming by its constituents into modernity, and is always the haven for backwards medieval thinking. Don't forget: for many Christians, not just the Evangelicals, the recognition and acceptance of homosexual rights is one more nudge for Jesus to return, kick ass, and call his flock home to Heaven. I am sure that, at one time, the Chosen felt that state recognition of a round Earth and, subsequently, a non-Earth-centric cosmos signaled the Beginning of the End. Extra points for our Wyoming representative being a sensible Republican.
I'm not sure I understand what you are insinuating.  That he is dumb because the numbers are evenly distributed? The way in which numbers are picked, if you go back far enough you'll find certain numbers get chosen significantly more often than others.  Some of it is chance, but when you are looking at hundreds or thousands of previous picks they can be explained by flecks of dirt, deformations on the ball, etc. I remember reading about a case where a group of college faculty calculated the highest probability number for a local pick 4.  After playing one ticket a week for just over a decade with a few close calls they hit the jackpot and ended up splitting a pot that was a serious windfall for them all. The odds are still not in your favor, especially for powerball, but if you are going to play you might use every advantage possible.
Picking balls solely based on probability is not inherently bad. In fact if I were playing the lottery I would not pick balls that come up the least often and the most often.  These are undoubtedly used by many 'lottery players' and thus you would be most likely to have to split your prize. Then again, I think I'll stick to not wasti^H^H^H^H^Hplaying.
Who should I sue for stealing the word "gay"? You know - every time I read old (19th century, EG) books and there are phrases like "he was very gay" or "that was a gay time" I stumble to parse it like "funny" or "energetic". Oh, and about the same thing happened in Russian where the word for homosexual is "blue" (or rather sky-blue) that came about just several decades ago. That _sucks_.
"That we have it isn't the same as having it, however." what do u mean? why does "already have air superiority" !=   "having air superiority"? "Bullshit." Do yourself a favor. Subscribe to and read a nice little magazine called Jane's

Churning out great code is only correlated with compensation. Consider the recent acquisition of YouTube. Do you think Google bought top quality code for that amount of money? Remember that Yahoo! even rewrote Paul Graham's work. These are businesses we are talking about. They work fuzzy. There's sales, hype, lies, luck, what have you at work. You can't talk about how MS is better at marketing and lock-in than writing good software and then think that compensation ought to be 99% correlated with the quality of your code. Have you never worked on projects that failed not because of bugs but because the requirements were wrong to begin with? And sometimes it doesn't even matter if your code is good or bad. The only way to make a case why you should be paid 3x the average is to show that you finish your projects in 1/3 the average time. Unfortunately, you may not be able to accomplish that even if you could code at 3x the average guy because it's not just about coding. It's about dealing with ambiguity and crappy, non-existing documentation and chasing down other devs who don't answer your email and explaining to the idiot customer why that is not what he wants or waiting for somebody to come along and tell you what the customer really needs.
Actually they do, this is the basis on which underfloor heating works.  The slightly increased radiant component from the floor allows the same level of comfort at slightly lower air temperatures.  However, I think we tend to find it more comfortable to have warmer feet and a cooler head (our heads being major heat generators themselves) hence underfloor heating is much more comfortable that overhead radiant sources.   
Depends on your definition of intelligent. Money does not exist. Money is an illusion. What exists is *resources* and *power*. When you win a lot of money, your resources haven't increased, but your power has. You can use that power in two ways: 1. To prioritise the utilisation of resources in a way beneficial to society.  2. To assimilate more power. If you go for 2, you have two more possible routes: 2.1. To prioritise the utilisation of resources in a way beneficial to society. 2.2 To assimilate even more power *simply for it's own sake*. The latter may be seen as egoistically intelligent and socially stupid.

I wouldn't sweat being below the earnings curve when you've got that much money working for you. He's still *up* and way ahead of inflation, so what if his investment strategy doesn't match his initial luck? He's so far ahead of the curve for responsibility, I don't see much point in debating if he has earned as much as he could since.
&gt; &gt; I suppose that how well that works depends on how evenly   &gt; &gt; those balls are weighted.  &gt;  &gt; Truer words were never spoken. I don't know how amateurish the US lotteries are, but I know that in many other countries the balls are regularly inspected and exchanged. So there's hardly anything to be gained from that. As misterlang writes below, the only thing to be gained from "number systems" is to pick numbers where you are not likely to divide your win with many others if they come up (birthdates being the obvious bad candidate).
I imagine the balls get changed on a regular basis, and that if you took all the people who attempt to employ statistical methods to win, you would find that they are not any more likely to win than those who choose completely at random. You read about that faculty case **because it eventually worked**, but how about the tens of thousands of others who no doubt thought they were equally clever?  You never read about them, because their attempts to second-guess the lottery didn't completely coincidentally coincide with them getting lucky and winning it.

Worked for me.  I went in knowing what I wanted ahead of time.   Then I just asked for all the pricing info on each seperate item.  Then I asked for the store manager... told him I would buy it all, right then, if he would meet my named price.  We dickered a little, but I saved about $2500 on a bunch of stuff that listed at ~ $9K.  They have a lot of wiggle room.  Especially on the big ticket items.   The thing that kind of pissed me was that, in the end, he met my named price within about $100... Really, the dickering back in forth is just to make them feel that they have "won" the negotation.  In hind site I am sure that if I made a move to walk toward the door that he would have meet my price point exactly.   I think the real thing to do is buy a lot of stuff. If you want a big-screen TV, stero, dvd player, surround sound, and a computer, get them all at once.   The more they sell, the better off the store is.  Sure, they may not get commissions on anything... but large ticket items they see upping store profits, thus making them look better to the home-office.   That makes them better off cause they meet some corp set quota.  Which is good for them.  You're just making them realize that.

are you giving a new meaning to the word blogspam?  http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/01/scary_blogspam_automation_tool_1.html
Sniggering at a fanfiction site might have other reasons besides the name...
Wow, some people have an over-inflated sense of the morals and integrity of teachers. How is this woman unfit to teach, judge, or police? At least her looks might give her the self-confidence that students need to see in their elders, and hold the attention of the boys, for better or worse. The fewer self-loathing cat-hoarding pre-marms in this profession the better. Plus, what parents are expecting their children to even find the link between their teacher and the photos? They've just made sure of it, ironically.
I wonder when programmers outgrow the stage when they're fascinated by bright colors. That amount of highlighting always seems to me like Lints annoying little brother...
Maybe they suspected the device was a witch, and after burning it didn't reveal Satan, they blew it up. Also, am I the only one that noticed the caption? "SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE DEEMED UNUSABLE IN BOSTON'S FINANCIAL DIST" On so many levels: 1) "deemed unusable" -- come ON, this is FOX, you lost 90% of your viewership at "deemed" 2) "deemed unusable" -- come ON, this is FOX, where a plastic spoon becomes a "deadly projectile" in the hands of the copy editor. 3) "unusable" -- where do I start on that one. Are Bostonians still so hostile to the English that they deliberately misuse the language? And HOW can the police not have seen and been familiar with these things? And this is in the deeper-blue North-east!? No ... words ...
Did you take the test? I'd figure that low-level homophobia is quite prevalent in Western society.  Especially between guys ... though it comes across as jokes, just jokes (even when you call someone "a fucking faggot"). Also, it was 1996, that's ten years of progress.  And Will &amp; Grace, ugh.
Modelling isn't a sin, consenting adults should be allowed to take their clothes off for money, and no doubt the complaining parents are largely being puritan idiots. But...consider how hard it is to keep control of a room full of 14-15 year olds, especially when you're a supply teacher. Now imagine them shouting 'Ere, miss, I've seen your tits on the internet!' It's an error of judgement on her part, at least.
I go that figure from the new scientist.  Anyway my point is still valid. Even if globabl warming is happening it is so hard to prove that by the time everyone is convinced it will be to late for increased efficency to solve it.  And your point about the difficulty of the cure is also made in the article.
&gt; u Die, infidel. &gt; why does "already have air superiority" != "having air superiority"? Because -- duh! -- that we have it now does not magically mean that we have it tomorrow: we actually need a lot of what you deride as 'pork barrel projects' to maintain it.  What's confusing about this? &gt; Subscribe to and read a nice little magazine called Jane's I very much doubt that doing so will land me in your confused universe where the F22 is at a disadvantage to the F15 or F16, when one of the latter 'catch up'.
I think they're just jealous that New York got all the action in 2001.
I did take the test and the result came back "highly non-homophobic" with the accusation that I must be gay.

&gt; On March 26th, 1945, this sinister mission was canceled by General Yoshijiro Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff, who declared that "Germ warfare against the United States would escalate to war against all humanity." Sensible.
That's a pretty good theory.
Très intéressant, merci. J'attends toujours avec impatience un simulateur d'état du marché du travail, par domain avec les métiers où il manque le plus de personnes qualifiées. C'est une mesure toute simple qui ferait sans doute baisser le chômage et qui favoriserait la croissance à long terme.
You don't have to say psssscht, it does that for you. Roger. Pssscht.
You know, I honestly can't remember ever hearing 10-4 over the coms in the 5 years I've been flying, and I listen to a lot of crazy "non-regular" talk coming from the majors quite a bit. Interesting. BTW, if you ever get a handheld radio and are by a local airport, tune in to 123.45 which is unofficially the official freq. to use when having casual dialog.
I think this comment  " A failure of political will in Washington and/or Baghdad." is a serious allegation against Bush administration
"Because -- duh! -- that we have it now does not magically mean that we have it tomorrow: we actually need a lot of what you deride as 'pork barrel projects' to maintain it. What's confusing about this?" It's confusing because:  1) every other country's defense budget pales in comparison to us; even if we reduced our defense spending in half  2) the countries that are closest to being our enemies who can take air superiority are also the furthest because our economies are so tied to each other that we effectively have a "shotgun marriage" eg. China's economy depends on export trade with the US / Aside from US tax payers, the country doing the most to float the US budget deficit is China "I very much doubt that doing so will land me in your confused universe where the F22 is at an advantage to the F15 or F16" The F22's main advantage is stealth. If stealth is neutralized due to the needed tradeoff of giving up some aerodynamic stability and manueverability; a traditional fighter will have the advantage in a dogfight over a stealth fighter. This isn't breaking news. It's old news. Yes, I live in a confused universe where we believe in facts and things like evolution and global warming.

&gt; What would you do different from him? Not play. 
Frankly, I don't believe that a store would be so stupid to do this (allow you to walk away with lower price). I'd believe that it's a calculated risk that they are willing to take. It's naive believing that stores wouldn't know about the hole in their plan, as article suggests. At any rate, if this advice lives a life, stores will stop doing the scam (that's what it is to me, really), so it's all for the better.
That's not the half of it, they just recently (past coupld of years) changed the number 3. Now, instead of being three, you are supposed to say tree. And yes, that is what I say. Most people look at me funny until I tell them that's the "correct" way to say it. When they don't believe me I hand them the FAR/AIM (rules/regs for pilots) and they are like, "huh."

From [How Asteroid Mining Will Work](http://science.howstuffworks.com/asteroid-mining1.htm) &gt; In addition to iron, nickel and magnesium, scientists think water, oxygen, gold and platinum also exist on some asteroids.  and: &gt;Water could also be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen to form rocket engine propellant. The metal ore on the asteroids could be mined and used for building spacecraft and other structures for a space colony. and: &gt;One NASA report estimates that the mineral wealth of the asteroids in the asteroid belt might exceed $100 billion for each of the six billion people on Earth. Personally, I think the first asteroid mining ships will be nuclear powered, not solar powered.
**WOW.** I was about to show everybody the magic of css used for print, which typically combines all of the pages into one, adds/nav/crap free page, and discovered something horrible. Go to the page and do a print preview (DO NOT PRINT!) and be amazed. On my 'puter it spews up a 5 page list of garbage. Honestly, some web designers apparently need a *lot* more schooling/common sense!

Let me ask a question, one that folks don't like to ask -- especially though who go around saying that nobody cares about what is happening in Darfur and places like it.    How do we stop it?   Really stop it.  Not just delay it for a few weeks, months or years.  But stop it.   Without committing the same acts of barbarism in response.   Remember, the acts now being committed against the Darfur people were being committed by them about 25-40 years ago.  It is one long cycle of revenge upon revenge upon revenge.  Nobody remembers which side did the first atrocity.  Not that it really matters much.   Now, please explain how it's in US national interests to stop it?  Why is it going to be worth dead Americans to fix Sudan, an intervention that will make our adventure in Iraq look like easy going fun times?  Sudan is a much more complicated place than is Iraq.  The whole horn of Africa is hell in comparison to the Garden of Eden that is Iraq.  Basically, it comes down to this... the fighting in the area will stop when the folks there get tired of the fighting.  It is not within our power to truly stop it.   By the way... if anybody really does have a workable plan to stop it that won't involve thosands of dead Americans, I'll be more than happy to get behind it and support it.  But come up with the plan first.  Don't just tell me how the whole world sucks... cause that's a given.
I think it would be fairly difficult to control a large proportion of Tor routers without anyone else knowing. However, in such an event, the solution is easy; run a Tor node yourself, that way not even large corporations, industry associations or well-funded governments can trace you.
Well, all the Tor nodes are public, so it would be able to tell if you were running a Tor server. But if you're a server as well as a client, then yep, you'd be right.
&gt; every other country's defense budget pales in comparison to us Gosh, then you agreed me this entire time about the need to maintain air superiority, and were only pretending stupidity a moment ago? &gt; a traditional fighter will have the advantage in a dogfight over a stealth fighter. By the qualification you finally offer for this assertion, I suppose that you read some fascinating piece in Jane's that talked about stealth in general.  Please make assertions about the F22, and especially about its -dogfighting capabilities-, with some actual fuzzy clue about the F22 in hand and not these here-nonsensical heavily-qualified generalities. Speaking of which, here is your qualification again in a more tautological form: &gt; If a fighter gives up some maneuverability, then it is less maneuverable in combat.  Less maneuverable aircraft necessarily have this as a weakness against more maneuverable aircraft. There.  Would you like to reason about the -the F22- and -previous generation aircraft-, now?  I've already told you what result some actual thinking will give you, but please go ahead anyway. &gt; I live in a confused universe where we believe in acts and things like evolution and global warming. What the fuck do these have to do with the F22? &gt; BTW: "Jane's Information Group [Has a wikipedia entry.](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane's) -- I'll check that if I have a sudden flash of curiousity, thanks.  Why say this?  Did you forget my 'confused universe' doubting?

She's a brave women. Others like her and Muslim equivalents of Martin Luther, who'll try to bring radical Islam kicking and screaming out of the Dark Ages like the Catholic church was, might just help in easing inter-religious relations.  Her counterparts in the US are also working hard to ensure that the Renaissance gains made by limiting the influence of Christianity are not undone by the wave of neo-Fundamentalism supported by the US Republican party.  I am probably talking shit, though, because most of what I know of the subject I have read on reddit ;-)
I'm sure it is done on powerball, now.  But was it in the past?  It wouldn't be too hard to analyze your data and see if predictions are continuing to hold up over time. Besides there are problems with changing the balls regularly.  There is a huge incentive for an insider to game the system and the more control they give the operators the more likely someone will attempt a loaded die scenario.  Better to just keep them locked up.

Sure, but clearly some developers are considerably better at problem solving than others.
"Gosh, then you agreed me this entire time about the need to maintain air superiority, and were only pretending stupidity a moment ago?" I guess you're too stupid to fully read my reasons #1 &amp; #2 "By the qualification you finally offer for this assertion, I suppose that you read some fascinating piece in Jane's that talked about stealth in general." Yes, I actually read something authoritative and it's not just Jane's. With you, you're just pulling shit out of your ass. "Would you like to reason about the -the F22- and -previous generation aircraft-, now?" I already did dumbass. A stealth aircraft is less aerodynamic than a traditional aircraft, therefore it is less manueverable and less stable. (ie the body designs for stealth is not as smooth - air does not flow as easiily over them compared to traditional aircraft designs) If you can't even understand that, you shouldn't even be talking about military aircraft. "What the fuck do these have to do with the F22?" It's called sarcasm moron
Oh yes, and they both pay for al-Qaeda ...

My goodness!  Here is your quote of me: &gt; "Would you like to reason about the -the F22- and -previous generation aircraft-, now? And here is your response to this quote: &gt; [I already did.] A stealth aircraft [...] a traditional aircraft [...] the body designs for stealth is not as smooth [...] traditional aircraft designs. No-- actually, you didn't.  And you don't now, either.  And still, none of these predicates you offer hold for the F22 and any previous generation of fighter. By the way, "body designs for stealth aircraft is not as smooth"?  Are you on crack, boy?  Have you even seen a crayon-drawing of the aircraft you speak of? &gt; It's called sarcasm moron 'evolution and global warming and poor grammar' is sarcasm?  Fine.  What the fuck does sarcasm have to do with the F22?

Apparently this video is from a couple of years back. Bill actually seemed like a much better journalist back then - nowadays he's become the Jerry Springer show by being deliberately controversial. He probably knows he's wrong and knows he's angering a lot of people, but as a result more people are talking about him and more people are watching his show. The film Idiocracy was so right, except they got the timeframe so wrong - it shouldn't have been set 500 years in the future, more like 20. As for MM, he was great. Kinda reminds me of Frank Zappa, when he (and his music) was being blamed for kids doing bad things.

Yes, I thought it was strange that when he won *a lot of money* he decided to use it to make *a lot of money*. It doesn't strike me so much as intellegent, as simple minded greed.

You can have some degree of anonymity with plenty of middlemen and secure boxes.  You put your pizza order in a box only person C can open. The box for C goes in a box only person B can open. The box for B goes in a box only A can open.  When you hand person A their box, they open it and find nothing buy another box they can't open, and instructions to forward it to person B. Person A knows who you are, but not that you're ordering pizza. When person B is handed their box, they open it and find nothing but a box for person C. Person B does not know you, nor that you're ordering pizza. When person C opens their box and find the pizza order, they know that someone somewhere is ordering pizza. But not that it's you. But how does the pizza find its way back to you? You have of course prepared a special return path set of boxes, which is put in the innermost box along with the pizza order. C opens the return path box, and finds instructions on how to create a secure box only you can open. C also finds another return path box only B can open.  So C puts the pizza in a box only you can open, and puts this box along with the return path box only B can open in a new box only B can open and hands it over. C of course knows all about the pizza, since they are handling it. B in turn puts the box only you can open (which holds the pizza) in another box only you can open together with a return path box only A can open and transfers it to A. B knows only somebody is getting back a box from C via A. From A you get yet another box only you can open. You open it and find the box B created for you. You open that and find the box C created. When you open that box you finally have your anonymously ordered pizza!
How about people just try not to piss each other off for no real reason? How many people who are religious are going to read this cartoon and say, "You're right! My beliefs _are_ rubbish! Why, I should give them up right away, so I can devote more time to promoting world peace or whatever."  My guess is zero. Now, I have seen cartoons that could potentially make people think, even if they disagreed with it. For example, the anti-ID one about the Viking version of intelligent design. That cartoon made its point in such a way that you could get it as a believer without feeling personally insulted. This cartoon though has no message other than, "Your beliefs are no different than worshiping a rock, and they make you irrationally violent," which is pretty much the definition of creating and using a negative stereotype.  Is it really the case that all believers are unthinking ignoramuses? What about Kant or Kierkegaard? Is it really the case that all religious people are violent? What about Mother Theresa, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, etc.?  Painting all these counterexamples away with a broad brush is what it means to use a stereotype. It's like I made a cartoon that say, "The history of black culture: listen to rap and shoot each other!" Yes, there are some black people who do that. In fact, you might even say that is glorified by some parts of black culture today. But if I made a stupid cartoon like that, I would be ignoring all of the really smart, honest, kind black people out there who are a part of black culture past and present and are diametrically opposed to violence.
&gt; Good comeback - complete with absolutely no facts I can't progress the conversation on my own, dear.  You'll note that I didn't respond to your first remark, with facts or otherwise.  How could I?  A pure insult has no hooks to hang a counter-argument. This new response of yours doesn't allow any interesting fact-introduction, either. In any case, your own sole advancement of the conversation came with your qualification of your repeated general assertion about 'stealth fighters' and 'tradiitional fighters'.  I called bullshit on your application of that assertion to the F22 and previous generations of fighters in my very first response, and 'moron moron moron' 'good comeback' 'I believe in sarcasm' is what you've come to, after simply repeating an assertion I've already declared to be utterly false. Please don't continue to embarass yourself by spreading more of these silly factoids about the F22.
&gt;"I can't deny that I would have preferred to see a clearer reference to God based on Christian ideals in the constitution," Merkel said. How about a reference to Santa Claus? He's just as real, and much more fun.
Trying to second-guess your enemy's motives is dodgy.  Without a proper insight (which you lack) into Al Qaeda's psychology, it is foolish to make leaps like you are making all over this matter: &gt; why would they lie? Why would they tell the truth? &gt; I don't see the obvious reasons for their unreliability.   &gt; What is their incentive for lying? These questions are unanswerable, and as I've pointed out above, they should be unaskable.  You have to start with things that you know about, rather than reasoning wildly about things that are unknown to everyone outside their inner circle. &gt; Chapter 2 of the 9/11 commission report is a well sourced   &gt; and well researched chapter. Yeah, the whole thing is "well sourced" and "well researched".  Doesn't make it true.  But if it *is* true, how do they know? &gt; If its so shaky, give me some actual proof that it is so.   &gt; You merely saying it is means nothing. Right back at ya kid.  The onus of proof is on you and the reports.  We know the CIA extensively funded the mujahadeen in Afghanistan, we know the Bin Ladens have close connections with the Saudi royal house, we know that Saudi money was in the pot as well, helping to set up madrassas (which later spawned the Taliban) in cooperation with the Pakistani ISI.  It seems there were a lot of players working in tandem against the Soviets, and a lot of money floating around, from all sorts of sources.  Categorical statements like the ones you have made need to be made with due trepidation, and quoting a congressional report on the etiology of the alleged perpetrators of 9/11 about this, is... well, one should be more circumspect and suspicious about one's sources. I suppose many Americans haven't learnt much from the patina of lies and loose reasoning that got you into Iraq.
&gt; \5. Laissez-faire capitalism is the prerequisite for trade and prosperity The International Monetary Fund may say so, as it imposes Thatcher-style solutions all over the world, but its own figures tell a different story. Its report on The World Economy in the 20th Century", published in 2000, includes a graph - printed very small, perhaps in the hope that no one would notice - which shows that the pre-Thatcherite period between 1950 and 1973 was by far the most successful of the century. This was an era characterised by capital controls, fixed exchange rates, strong trade unions, a large public sector and a general acceptance of government's role in demand management.  Let's play a game - can you spot the gaping hole in his logic?
I have not laughed this much at a reddit post EVER!

"War on terror" is just marketing. If it would really have been a war on terror the war would be with Saudi Arabia instead of Iraq.

Yes it does. For perspective, you might like to consider that France alone built over 50 nuclear reactors in 15 years. So building 15 nuclear reactors *across the world* each year for 50 years? Easy. The EU alone could do much more than that without breaking a sweat. As for coal plants, you can forget it because there won't be enough coal to feed those plants. As for wind turbines, the industry is having trouble keeping up with demand already. That's because you need 3x as many turbines in a wind farm as you would in an equivalent-sized nuclear reactor. There's a reason why General Electric *loves* wind farms. As for solar panels, those are just too ludicrous.
Delete the "on our side" from the first item and I'll give it my blessing...
"How could I? A pure insult has no hooks to hang a counter-argument." I think you're confusing your posts with mine... "This new response of yours doesn't allow any interesting fact-introduction, either." What's the point when you never responded to any of my facts   with other counter facts? You're just spewing pure opinion At least research what I wrote before making really stupid assertions you know nothing about. If you can find some valid authoritative article that disproves what I wrote fine; I call that having a good discussion; but if all you're going to do is say "you're wrong because I say so": grow up. talking you to is like talking to a fundamentalist religious freak about evolution
What about Iraq? Over 600,000 dead Iraqis and Americans feel nothing about that either. Americans like to obsess about Sudan because it's a conflict in which they appear to be uninvolved.
CONDENSED VERSION: Referential transparency makes programs easy enough to reason about that staring at the code does as much good as attaching a debugger.  Immutable data-structures often feature in referentially transparent algorithms -- isn't that nice?  Purity makes referential transparency almost unescapable -- isn't that nice?  I like to say that things 'just work'.   (aside: most of these come from a good amount of hostility for the uncondensed version.  In this case, I sincerely (and agreeably) write the first sentence -- and then sneer at the end.  Sorry if this balances poorly.)
yeah if this happens i wont the easter bunny, toothfairy, lochness monster, and other such professional charactor persons to protest. who is this god person anyways?

Thats true....War is always for testing new weapons and finding new markets for it.
This reminds me of how I made my first million. It wasn't easy I can tell you. I don't like to brag, but what I did really took some balls. You see I started out with only 20p to my name. It was a hard life. I decided to put my 20p to good use. I made *one* phonecall... "Dad, lend me a million pounds"
That'll be a huge demographic.
Yeah, Stewie... from that bit where he was singing Rocket Man. Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff!

Thanks for posting this. It does make sense, although I don't think *every* reference to God in the OT could be attributable to a volcano. Thousands of years ago, if you witnessed a thunderstorm, how could you explain it? It clearly wasn't man-made, it obviously carried great destructive energy, and the rumbles and roars would indeed sound like an angry god. In fact, it would be a perfectly logical thing to believe, considering the limit knowledge available at the time. To this day, if someone sneezes, people still say "bless you".
If you're an Indian, you chop onions while deciding what to cook :) (At least, I frequently find myself doing that.)
Which is why we should put such labels on all our skyscrapers. That's just as effective as the Department of Homeland Security.

Nevermind the fact that Wyoming was the first state to give women the vote; they are all a bunch of backward-ass, in-bred, beer-drinkin', gun-shootin' assholes.  Right.  What a crock. I lived in Wyoming for five years during the 90's and what I found was that while there certainly were intolerant elements, for the most part the state has a hardcore Western sort of pioneer ethos to the effect that so long as it doesn't adversly effect others, anyone can do pretty much what they want.   Most Wyomingans I know, if they even think about it, don't necessarily approve of the gay lifestyle.  But neither do they especially give a shit about it either.  This is the most sparsely populated state in the lower 48, and even in the Disneyland freak-show that is Jackson Hole, the attitude is very much anti-authoritarian.  One lives in Wyoming not only because it is beautiful, but also because for the most part, people will leave you alone. That's why I would not be at all surprised if the whole thing turned out to be a non-issue.   
*sigh* I miss the Boondocks.

Unique types guarantee that a data structure can only pass through a program in a singly-threaded manner, without duplication, and thus that operations that mutate it can happen destructively -- without losing referential transparency.  Clean (I've heard) and Mercury both use this to e.g. safely mutate the state of the universe, for IO.  Haskell guarantees the single-threadedness of its 'state of the universe', with the same benefits, through its IO monad. Version types don't get the enforcedly-available performance-gains that unique types do, but rather get them automatically whenever they are treated like a unique type. The fun thing about all of this is that the efficiency gain in both cases is just an optimization, like loop-unrolling and deforestation.  Even modifying the state of the entire universe in-place is an optimization, albeit a critical one :-) Versioned types currently in Mercury's library: [http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/information/doc-release/mercury_library/version_005farray.html](arrays), 2-d arrays, bitmaps, hash tables, and, uh, ['stores'](http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/information/doc-release/mercury_library/store.html) (the more-documented non-versioned implementation).

Boo-hoo, I don't understand shit but I have to post random crap. The dialog is the result of someone being the owner of the directory and the directory having no read rights. Since tho owner is entitled to have full control over the rights, **where's the fucking problem**? It's been the same in every multi-user permission system aroud since 1966. Oh, yes, haha, M$ is so stupid wank wank etc.
Hooray! (for his coming out)
Again, I think he means that Win2k was around as an alternative to ME, not that it was re-released; this time around, there is no alternative, and *therefore*, XP should be re-released with feature upgrades but retaining core functionality to provide that choice/backup.
Modded up because sometimes humour doesn't have to be sophisticated or clever to make you laugh. Even on Reddit!

It's just I weep a little when I see money not managed well. That's all.
Pah.  At this point, he -is- sleeping.  In small bouts, any time his brain can squeeze some in, even if it has to still move him unconsciously down the hallway, into the bathroom, out of the bathroom, and back to his computer.  He's probably also having hallucinations, too.  No, not fairies and dancing frogs: he is beset with dreamlike perceptual assertions: he -knows-, the way you know where your hands are and that it's lit here, that someone is right beh-- what the fuck?  Damnit, I need to sleep.  60 hours?  I could swear that just a second ago it was 58.  And why is my crotch wet?

How useful is this system in winter time?

This is so true. I'm hardly a 'proper' programmer; I did some basic as a kid, switched to delphi because it had the immediate grafitying effect of omg windows with buttons, then switched to php+mysql  because I had to build a site, and liked webdesign. I never followed any computer science courses, and am in all ways probably below mediocre. And yet, I read many of the programming articles, including the ones I don't really 'get'. I know I'll probably never use haskell, or anyting other than php, and yet I spend a lot of time reading up on it. What's wrong with me?
&gt; I think you're confusing your posts with mine... Uh, no.  The text immediately preceeding your quote of me directs you to the 'pure insult' I couldn't've possibly responded to: &gt; I guess you're too stupid to fully read my reasons #1 &amp; #2 &gt; You're just spewing pure opinion No, I've told you that your assertions about the F22 are stupid and wrong.  These are assertions I'm offering, dear, and can be argued against or argued for or -- omigosh! -- even checked factually, with actual research about the capabilities of the aircraft under question.  An opinion is something else entirely. &gt; At least research what I wrote What you wrote?  What you wrote is right there, where you wrote it.  There's no research to do, except for the experimental sort that entails continued dealings with you.  Why don't you research how true it is that the F22 'is at a disadvantage' when previous-generation aircraft 'catch up to it'? &gt; grow up. When I grow up, will I remember not to confuse anyone who happens to oppose me in rhetoric with anyone else (a 'fundamentalist religious freak', say) who opposes me on any other issue? &gt; talking you to is like talking to a fundamentalist religious freak about evolution Ha ha!  Oh my, please don't make me imagine you arguing as poorly as you have with anyone at all :-)
How about Bush stops paying al-Qaeda to kill his own troops - would that boost their morale?
This article is terrible. It doesn't discuss the underlying cause of the price increase (the weather causing a supply shortage), but chalks it up to inflation. A fivefold increase in the price of one commodity item over the course of a week is inflation? Maybe in post-WWI Germany.
So let me get this straight, you're saying that a military commander *shouldn't* be concerned with what's happening politically on the home front, even though it's obviously going to have a huge impact on his ability to conduct effective operations?  Are you serious?  Ouch!  It's a good thing George Washington didn't share your way of thinking, otherwise we wouldn't even be having this conversation.
"No, I've told you that your assertions about the F22 are stupid and wrong." Ok, then prove it. Tell me besides stealth (since it can be neutralized), how is the F22 better than say an F15 or better yet a Mig33? "Why don't you research how true it is that the F22 'is at a disadvantage' when previous-generation aircraft 'catch up to it'?" Here's a simple reference:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_aircraft#Drawbacks_of_stealth_aircraft_designs

Santa Claus didn't have a big influence on past matters though, Christianity did. A nice trade off could be that Christian values can be mentioned but not 'god'.
I'm not even going to RTFA.  I'm going to comment on the title of this post.  Mindvirus would have you believe that somehow our civilization is endanagered by not being able to swear in a public place.  And that somehow a terrorist act is even remotely equal to an act of public bad behavior.  And that if we can't indulge in bad behavior the terrorists have won!  Won what?  For these particular terrorists swearing in their airports might result in a public flogging.  Who would have won at this point?  US Homeland security?  The logic construct is stupid, and immature.   Get a life.
&gt; how is the F22 better than say an F15 eh?  [STFW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F22#Comparisons).  I'm not here to hold your hand and give you books to read.  In civil society, it should be enough for someone to call bullshit on matters you yourself know you've low familiarity with.  Particularly in civil net society, where you demand my time when you can spend only your own more effectively. &gt; Here's a simple reference: which speaks primarily of the F-117 and the B-2, and only refers to the F22 in its 'see also' links.  Do you understand that some knowledge of historical stealth does not allow you to ignore the F22 itself in discussion of it?
Hilarious. Didn't age very well, though... that's what they get for covering Irene Cara.
Interesting comment.  I have been studying homophobia and bigotry for years, and never thought of the first point you made. People may fear change, even though it is for the good, even for them. Like you, I am trying to empathize.
Brilliant. This one man exposes the ridiculousness of this policy- after receiving numerous honors from the highest levels for his service and sacrifice, he announces he is that which the same system that honored him simultaneously says he is unfit for service. Our armed forces would be insanely lucky if all of its members were of such bravery and integrity. Sgt. Eric Alva, I salute you.

READ THE BINKS REPORT! Nutter.
Do you mean that military guys are supposed to obey all the foolish things ordered by the politicians??? And they don't have the right to express to their view???  They know whats really happening in the war front...At least consider their sentiments..they are fighting for your safety not just for their family.
Only if they have wires sticking out, or batteries.

This is a brilliant book. It's funny, its clever and its informative. Read it.
No, the sentiment here is that even though he knows he'll probably lose in the next primaries he still does what he thinks is *right*. It just shows that, as opposed to most politicians (in the world, this is not limited to the USA) the guy has both a conscience and more than 5 neurons. And stands for what he believes in no matter what it costs him.

Ok your reference has no facts or science behind it.  It only has testimonials. Mine does. HOW is an F22 better? "In June 2006 during Exercise Northern Edge (Alaska's largest joint military training exercise), the F-22A achieved a 144-to-zero kill-to-loss ratio against F-15s, F-16s and F/A-18s simulating MiG-29 'Fulcrums', Su-30 'Flankers', " This is a simulation assuming that stealth works. What happens when the plane is detected? We all know that not all military exercises are objective. It's another way for pentagon officials to land board seats at defense companies. "which speaks primarily of the F-117 and the B-2, and only refers to the F22 in its 'see also' links." theoritically all stealth aircraft have certain attributes in common. Losing aerodynamic perfection to minimize the radar cross section is one of them. It still applies to both the F22 and F35.

You of course realize that going from 98 to Win2k was a monumentous leap forward in technology / design. Literally almost the entire core was changed in that upgrade (in a good way). Vista, on the other hand, offers practically no improvements over XP (minus the eye-candy but who cares). Don't get me wrong, there are obvious changes/improvements, but nothing too crazy like 98 to NT. Longhorn (pre-vista codename) was suppose to have actual cool things in it like a new filesystem but many of them were cut in the 3 year pushback Microsft had. I guess they needed more time to implement all that DRM / backdoors (I'm sure hackers -- in the real meaning of the word -- will find some). Man I need to goto sleep my formatting is horrid!
Misleading title. It isn't Germany that wants mentions of Jehovah in the EU constitution, it's Angela Merkel. The title misleads Americans into thinking there exists a modern european nation that's even half as religious as the USA is christofascist.
This sounds too much like a parable to be true, but I find a very nice parable.

meh, my sense is that Kevin Rose and company have made a conscious decision that it's better to have a volatile and agonistic system, and that to some extent this type of gaming makes them more legitimate/worthwhile/noticed.

I never understood measuring bite strength in psi. It seems to me that the further from the fulcrum of the jaw you travel the less the bite force will be. note I say force and not pressure. I think it would be more relevant to talk about bite strength as a either a moment or a plain force.

&gt; there is a strong suggestion that great coders tend to have worse than average 'people' skills. Then I suspect that although they get results fast, they cause trouble in the long run. In my experience, that kind of coder is often lousy on documentation, right down to source comments and meaningful variable names.  Brooks had two multipliers, one for making a program usable for more people (the further you get from the initial developer, the harder it gets - and usability here applies to both usability of the source code and usability of the application) and one for making it work in a system (the more interfaces it has to other programs, operating system features etc.) If you skimp on these, you can get superficially impressive stuff out pretty quickly.

Do you even know what a "political pundit" is?  If a guy (David Petraeus) who holds a PHD in international affairs from Princeton and a fellowship at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service is not qualified to be a pundit, you tell me who is.  Rush Limbaugh?   He doesn't even have a degree.  Bill O'Reilly?  He's got a BA in history and an MA in broadcast journalism.  Whatever.  The point is that the top military brass in this country is made up of a group of highly intelligent and almost ridiculously educated men.   What you are arguing basically amounts to saying that our top military commanders should simply act as automated administrators who exist in a sort of vacuum.  Orders come in from the top, and then they are shat out through the bottom with no regard whatsoever for things like reality or contingency or improvisation based upon intelligent and informed analysis.  It is not given to a military commander to think of the future outside of his immediate area of operations; he simply executes orders and lets his superiors worry about the details?   Are you on drugs?  How do you think General Petraeus is going to be able to come up with a viable strategy if he *doesn't* take all possibilities into consideration and plan for the most probable future?    You obviously know nothing about military history.   
I disagree.  As an atheist, there is LOTS you could show me that would change my mind about the existance of God.  There is nothing I (or anyone) can show your average, run-of-the-mill, not-a-suicide-bomber religious person that could change thiers. Or should everyone be open-minded about every possible theory anyone can put forth, regardless of any evidence provided?
Fuckin A Dick!  For once we agree!
Assuming a TCP conversation, there's not really a lot you can do without revealing your IP address. I suppose theoretically you could hook packet sniffing equipment between a random IP, and the system you wanted to talk to, and inject/extract packets that look like they're coming from the random IP, but never actually come/go to there. However, that's not something your average user's going to pull off. For unicast UDP (and maybe TCP for Transactions), you could at least  get some data sent out, without using your own IP address, but still nothing getting back. You could possibly get something useful done using UDP; unicast to send, and multicast to receive, but your upstream routers would still need to know you wanted the multicast stream, even if the remote server doesn't need to know. He doesn't cover Tor, but even then you're just making it much harder (infeasible, ideally, but I'm not going to sit down and start double checking the protocol right now) to identify yourself. Anything I've missed?

I think he's talking about the graph on page 154 [here](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2000/01/pdf/chapter5.pdf)[PDF]. &gt; Let's play a game - can you spot the gaping hole in his logic? I can spot a few holes: * the graph is of Global Per Capita Real GDP Growth. Notice that he leaves off the word *Global*. It has nothing to do with Thatcher. * All the graphs are the same size, the same width at least, due to the two-column format. This one wasn't printed any smaller than the others. * The growth rate in a post-war period is high because people are rebuilding from scratch from a period of extreme shortages. The first two points show that this guy is very dishonest. I wouldn't trust a word he says. 
Reasons against IDEs: - They are buggy. Or expensive. Usually both.  - Often they are targetted for specific language or a small set of languages.  - Built-in editors are sometimes sub-par. They may feel like a PDA or MP3 player in a phone.  - "Live" debugging with stepping and breakpoints have limited range of applications.  - And they do tend to lock your mind into doing things some certain boring ineffective ways. Having a form designer will prompt you to spend a day placing dozens of controls at certain locations. Having database components can make you thing it is neat to have 200 "queries" on your form instead of calling much simpler SQL in a procedural way. Etc.

&gt; not the hardcore bukake/lolita stuff You can hide what you'd prefer not to share.  You can have under another account what you'd prefer to less-connectedly share.  If you update delicious primarily through its very pleasant API, it should only require a bit of extra tooling to e.g., automatically unshare or send-to-side-account links with certain tags. Even if you primarily use del.icio.us through your browser, I suppose that you can have these advantages with either some kind of extra firefox/opera work, or with a local httpd.
I didn't know about the NDP harboring the right-wing nutters until reform started. Is that because of : * Prairies regionalism?   * the extremists to the left and the right finding they have more in common with each other than with the people in the centre?  * the religiously motivated people who founded the party with Tommy Douglas moving to Reform with Preston Manning? That would help to explain the decline of the NDP on the prairies anyway. I still think that it had more to do with the NDP's being discredited and progressively ignored from the fall of the Berlin Wall on. Since the economic arguments of the NDP, for better or worse, were either co-opted or ignored starting around then, they started pushing an ultra-liberal social agenda which just doesn't fly with people outside of their small core support, further diminishing their results in elections.
It's to stir the drink and keep it hot, you dumbass.
&gt;wasted their money on a lottery ticket. A lottery ticket is not necessarily wasted money. It depends on the way you attribute value to things. Suppose you spend $5 on a lottery ticket once in a while. Objectively, it's not going to change much in your life. BUT you buy a chance of winning something you would never be capable of achieving by working for instance. So it's not so much a problem of expected value. A lottery ticket is clearly not an investment (if you treat it that way, you are obviously braindead). It's buying a chance (albeit very small) of getting something you could never get otherwise.
You misspelled ['dependency injection'](http://del.icio.us/bvandendriessche/dpendency_injection), and -- I understand that it's some kind of style, possibly, and not just a coping mechanism from exposure to the syntax of most languages, but: you can use (and you have used!) dashes in tagnames :-)
Pica you know nothing about the military. So please don't assume.
We should impeach the guy who decided on that 'Don't ask, don't tell' policy!
I think a lottery ticket is a great cheap thrill.  Yes, you have very little chance of winning the jackpot, but for say $2 a week (much less than your average latte) you get the thrill of 'what if?'. John.
I've often pondered what would make a system free to follow its own development path. With some basic business logic and a couple of offshore trusts, a self-owned system could evolve in a competitive habitat. Allow it to spin off copies of itself and let it run. The obvious way for it to make money for itself these days would likely be spam-based, but at least a side-effect would be that without human costs, it could lower margins and put the human spammers out of business.
What hole? You go to the doctor, he sends you a bill, you don't pay it, he sends it to collections, you don't pay it. And there's nothing they can do about it, since you're poor and have no money! Then, you find another doctor...   
I feel abused by this article. I was born in 1960 and being a tad precocious came to political consciousness at the end of Wheen's chosen period, 1950-1973. I remember a national teachers' strike in 1969, home from school, hurrah! I remember the electricity going off in 1972 with the   [miners' strike](http://www.agor.org.uk/cwm/themes/events/1972_1974_strikes.asp)  Dad had a Tilley lamp. You pumped it up by hand and it sprayed parafin onto a mantle, like in a gas lamp, giving a bright white light. The adults were in a flap. Politics was highly contested. Should the banks be nationalised? Nationalisation was getting an increasingly bad name as politicians struggled to make it work in practise. The bitter struggle was fought over the nuances of corporatism. Big government, big business, nation trade unions, all tied together by the expertise of experts. Remember "experts", they were the big thing before "market forces", fixing exchange rates and designing capital controls to maintain them. As the wheels came of the UK economy and it slumped into stagflation the experts designed prices and incomes policies and the businessmen and trades unions got stuck into gaming them. Years later I read a book by J.K.Galbraith. I expected to read the left-wing/social-democratic solution to the problem of stagflation, but he dismissed the problem because the word was ugly. My father was an engineer, so I had access to a narrative of economic progress than ran orthogonal to politics. If I wanted to understand prosperity I needed to look at jet engines, television, plastics, CNC machine tools. I grew up in a Britain that was coming to feel that it had missed out on the post war boom because of capital controls, fixed exchange rates, strong trade unions, a large public sector and a general acceptance of government's role in demand management. More important was the realisation that you couldn't have both unemployment and prosperity. People had to make things, or provide valuable services to people who made things. This was why people tolerated Thatcherism and the high unemployment that her policies created. Confused? People in the UK in their 50's have lived through a hard lesson that you cannot hide unemployment. Having people in government/protected/subsidised jobs in which they don't actually do very much doesn't work. Soaking up employment with unproductive busywork doesn't work either. The phoney jobs and the hidden unemployment had to go. Obviously that meant real unemployment, but the really unemployment find jobs, the hidden employed stay where they are. Francis Wheen is writing in a UK paper for a UK audience. He is painting a picture of 1950 to 1973 that attributes the successes, such as they were, of that era to particular policies. The people who lived through those times grew disillusioned with those policies.  Wheen's article targets the under thirties. Older people have little patience with being told that the history they lived through didn't really happen.

um, in fact the mayor is one of the two people that voted to keep him...  &gt;Mayor Patricia Gerard and Commissioner Rodney Woods cast the dissenting votes.
I particularly liked his comment that "The great thing about the lottery was that I get to experience amazing things with people I care about." A growing fraction of my income has been going towards that.
Huh?  You mean to say that the current madness isn't *only* due to bush and the neocons?  Heresy!  I'd watch your back around these parts if I were you...
&gt; I can. You can't sincerely write "I couldn't have created [your POO] all by myself.", however. Do you dislike the tautology-or-hyperbole of the "I couldn't've done it all by myself" idiom?  Did you want to let us know that you can, having seen POO, implement POO by yourself?  (Do you consider the documentation you will actively refer to as you do this?  I mean, shrugging off all of society -- OK, I can dig.  But you're scum if technical writers are unpeople to you.)  Did you mean this to demonstrate superiority over the POO person?  (Do you consider the POO person -of right now-, who almost certainly can also 'create POO all by himself'?  If you only hold the historical version of this person in contempt, why not go all the way back?  You're -way better- than just-leaving-the-womb POO-author; that useless punk can't even read documentation.) 
Just brilliant. For decades, terrorists have known to conceal explosives in familiar objects that don't look out of place.  Like parked cars and vans. Glad to see Boston PD is [still](http://reddit.com/info/126l3/comments) ready for an imminent change of tactics.
Amen. _"It has always struck me as ironic that the primary use of the GPL in the business world is to exert control over customers and require them to pay licensing fees for uses outside the GPL."_
She's pandering to her base... &gt;  "I can't deny that I would have preferred to see a clearer reference to God based on Christian ideals in the constitution," Merkel said. &gt; She added, however, that the European Union was not a "Christian club" and stressed the need for tolerance of all religions in the bloc. Here, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a most typical specimen of Homo Politicus Germanicus.
Cool idea. In the sweepstake on how long before the CD tray gets snapped off on one of those, I'll take 1-2 days.
nice
The question says 'in-floor heating', not radiant heating. It might be one of those horrible gas floor furnaces. Insulate first, in any case. And lose the dogs.
&gt; then your just a wazoo. you're.
Surely you can't be serious?
Sam Fox's responses are the reason that American politics is in the state it is. He agrees that 527s are terrible, but says he must participate in them because there are democratic 527s. **"They" did it, so I have to do it too** Sam Fox says that this is the way things are and he wishes there was something that could be done: **"They" are responsible, I am innocent because I am powerless** He says that congress should do something about the 527s: **"They" should do something about it** This man has no personal integrity. His first reaction to Kerry's question: "So, two wrongs make a right?" is telling. Fox says: "Well, I don't know..." In the next sentences he goes back on script, but the moment of truth in his testimony was there in those four words. It is not the lack of congressional oversight of 527s that is the problem here, but the lack of personal integrity of individual people like Sam Fox. At the risk of confirming Godwin's law, I must observe that Sam Fox's moral reasoning processes are exactly those described by Hannah Arendt when commenting on the Eichmann trial in "Eichmann in Jerusalem".
there is an ipod/ phone charger that works like that. solio.com (just fyi)
Yeah, I saw Cavuto hosting an informative round-table with a group of Hooter's waitresses in uniform. He's clearly a journalist of the highest caliber.   Cavuto is a lowly hack insofar as he doesn't have control over FOX's official positions. He's given orders on how to "spin" the news.
I don't think that's an accurate statement.  The largest commercial GNU/Linux vendors - Red Hat and Novell - don't do this.  The Free Software Foundation, controlling copyrights to a lot of important free software like gcc, does not do this.  None of the Linux kernel developers do this.  You can point to companies like MySQL who do dual licensing, but those are not the majority.
He talks like a teacher explaining things to a small child. He used to talk much faster, but he wasn't getting the points across to the majority of people with lower IQs, so he slowed down.
Best. Title. Evarr.
I just boggle. How on Earth did we get to this point? What convoluted logic do the Labour party use, that tells them poor white people are 'less deserving' than poor brown people?
Lazy ad hominem attack you fucking ratbag communist.
Hillary is smarter than Jefferson. I'm guessing not.
It definitely gets better from 45% in.  Pure political pwnage!
Surely the IQ attributed to GWB is the total for the entire Bush family ? 
I've never seen the problem with 'Keyboard not found. Press F1 to continue.'   Anyone who needs to be told to sort out the problem (by plugging the kbd in, removing the coffee mug that's resting on one of the keys, replacing it or whatever) *then* hit F1 probably also needs to be told to [open the door before coming in](http://www.ibras.dk/montypython/finalripoff.htm#Cherry).
Quite.  I'm not on the list but I should be - I buried all those pointless copies of the same non-story as they popped up.
