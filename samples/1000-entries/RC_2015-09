Hey Rod! Late to the party, but I have a question about your father's poem 'Nightingale Woman'. I have heard that a full version exists outside of what was quoted in 'Where No Man Has Gone Before' but have been unable to find anything other than fan fiction over the years.  To your knowledge, is there a full text to the poem, and if so, could you share it with us?

/u/thedisquietedpen has summed up some good strategies.  Here is my take on this:  &gt; pre-roll damage   No OR here for the DM.  It is provided in the MM and is a time saver.  Use it.  Not the players though, rolling damage is fun for them.  &gt;you have 5-60 seconds (I usually settle for ~15) to take your turn.   Players need to start there turn with "I move, I attack, I cast, I will..."  If they don't get it right out then they delay to the bottom of the init.  If they still don't have it then they defend.  In my opinion, your turn is not to be used to ask me how a power or spell works.  If you don't know, then your character doesn't know. One of my problems is the realization of what a spell REALLY does when I go to resolve it and then they want to take it back.  But I'm griping here.  &gt;keep initiative visible  Use index cards folded in half like tents and let your players manage this for you, they know how to write with markers and 'sort descending'  &gt;cut down on out of character talking in combat.   Yea, this is hard to do but the phrase, "That is about all you can convey to the group as a free action.  Anymore and chit chat will be your action."  ----  You are the level you are for the whole session when I start the session.  You had x days/weeks to level up...we have started.  Also, your group might not be the type to want lots of combat.  Go combat light for a while.  In 4e, the most I could pull off was usually 1 combat encounter and our record was 2.  Now 5e, I can get 2-4 in easy but they changed the game.
I believe so too.

Doing the whole check-out line thing at the grocery store.  I have to put all the items in the cart, unload them on to a conveyor belt, have them put in bags, load them back in a cart . . . then take them to my car, load them in my trunk, drive home, take the bags into the house, and then put everything away.   I saw an article years ago that talked about being able to scan an item, put it into your cart, then just pay at the end of the trip, skipping the whole conveyor belt/cashier bagging process.  Where is this technology?  I have waited in lines to check out for upwards of 45 minutes at the grocery store or WalMart (especially at the beginning of the month).  It is infuriating!

And the whole point of discussion is to move one way or the other, and just because you and a few others in the thread don't like it doesn't mean that everyone disagrees.

Really though, this has less to do with diamonds and more to do with the psychological aspect of advertising and marketing.  This just proves that advertising works and works well.  If you have a product and you have the resources to advertise, you can change the world.  It may take years, but these advertising agencies have successfully convinced the (western) world to change it's conceptions about engagements and marriage. The diamond industry is targeted a lot in these kinds of articles because diamonds are relatively worthless. But don't forget that there have been entire marketing campaigns to get us to constantly buy new homes, cars, clothes, electronics and a whole slew of other things that do not need to be produced and or purchased.

Anecdotally, I've read about and seen a lot of gamepad use in relation to this game. It seems like a fairly common input method for more casual playthroughs of this game.  That said, the core game doesn't make any distinction between the two methods and I don't think this mode should either. If you want to compete, you should either use a keyboard and mouse or become the best controller player in the universe.

Don't forget when you write up your post that mainline Protestants definitely feel no obligation to go every week. We have probably 3x more "regular" attenders than weekly attendance would indicate. It's just that it's different people every week. There are also people who don't attend except Christmas and Easter, but still support the church financially and through prayer and volunteer efforts.  Meanwhile, Joel Osteen's church will have 20000 attendees until the day he retires, and then they'll have about 10. And they'll still teach heresy ;)  I guess I'm just saying that service attendance is not a good way to rate how a church is doing.

Women over the age of 20 are more likely to survive childbirth.  I know this because I've worked for one of the leading reproductive health organizations in the world.  Second, the discussion is focused on evolution.  When you're talking about primitive humans, every woman who needs a c-section would be dead.  You can't say, "20 year olds are naturally the best at having babies... as long as there is an OR handy!"  And a lot of the age-autism evidence focuses on increased paternal age as a risk factor for autism.

If you want to base the battery life off of tests like that then there are android phones that will probably perform better simply because they have massive batteries (droid turbo, Sony Z line, etc.).

They outright disable it for the entire area while a boss is up.  Just like how you can in hotjoin PvP but it's disabled in structured PvP for the entire match.  It's a state flag for characters they can enable and disable. So you won't be able to change even if you are defeated. The flag won't come back until the boss is defeated or the party wipes.

To the contrary, I would say that this post is at least constructive. The positivity is debatable, but I would say it's at least non-negative.   Relying too heavily on the narrative can definitely draw away from player agency; like you say, it feels more like a show than a role-playing game. To draw on some old RollPlay criticism, it feels more than a bit scripted.  Clearly, not all parts of the audience are being entertained by this style of GMing, as this thread and many of the replies to it clearly state. Perhaps you should think twice before claiming to speak on behalf of "the audience".
You should feel ashamed of yourself.

Maybe not, but if the apartment was marketed with a pool, then not having one is significant.  The lack of a pool could be considered a material difference in what was represented when you signed your lease.  It's conceivable that if taken to a judge, the landlord would be required to either fix the pool, reduce the rent, or release the tenant from the lease.  It's unlikely the landlord will do any of these things short of being directed to by a judge.  Even with some sort of judgement, it's not likely that you'd be retroactively awarded anything.  Generally speaking, for any sort of complaint to have traction, you'd have to make your complaint in writing to the landlord.  Then give them enough time to reasonably remedy the problem after the formal complaint (this is not retroactive).  If they don't fix the problem, then you can seek a remedy through the court.  
My guess is either pro packs (like a 7 pack bundle) or maybe more badges or something. 
I don't agree, I think this points system isn't fair , the day that they are giving teams that didn't play well a second chance isn't fair to the other teams that were consistent all season . C9 didn't even get in the playoffs because they played poorly through the split, so you reward them with a chance at worlds for finishing 7th? Alright riot I don't understand what you're doing.

&gt;The only reason publishers put out schemes like this is because they know people will preorder games despite every logical argument against it.  Really? The only reason? How much experience do you have in video game marketing? I'm guessing none. Stop speaking out of your ass.  &gt;So no, using this example to demonize preorders as a whole is not dumb.  It definitely is. Just because I preorder, doesn't mean I support shitty preorder incentives. You can do one without doing the other. I don't like how Deus Ex preorder is being handled, so I don't preorder it. Simple as that.  &gt;No, but they are contributing to the anti-consumer practices  Oh my god call the cops they are offering us to buy a product before release because they *hate us!*  I don't get why people like you have to treat it so black and white, good and evil. It is a video game, a product. You don't have to get "annoyed" that people value something differently than you. Just let it go and shut up about it.

what type of past do you have? abuse? crime? family related?  The real problem might have nothing to do with the people but the social context. The geographical location. Occasionally normal people are capable of getting deep. Of getting "real". But it takes certain circumstances. I'm sure you can think of a few right now.  One option may be to involve yourself with a religious organization. You don't have to BELIEVE or whatever. Or maybe you are already a part of one of these things. but you should be able to talk to the pastor about these type of things or during small group discussions or whatever.  Another option may be meetups. Occasionally there are more "intellectual ones" where you can just talk about random shit and maybe this type of shit will come up and you can subtly share a little bit of stuff and see how things go. If you just drop a bomb, of course things won't go well.

Honestly, I don't know how your relationship with him can recover from this.   He had a choice to make and he made it. Going forward, it's always going to be about the money and you'll always be looking at his motives, questioning if he wants you or the money. At this point, it wouldn't matter if you discussed it with him; based on what he's shown you about himself already, you know his focus is now on the money.   Dump his ass.

Look at Huni, he actually speak decent english, have Lustboy, Impact or Piglet ever done an interview in english? Perhaps they do speak english but apparently not well enough to ever do so in an interview. 
The fact that plenty of people who could be called victims in the world doesn't disprove the fact that opposition to gay marriage makes gay people victims of discrimination.   I never claimed that there weren't people who were opposed to gay marriage. But it's irrelevant to my point. The amount of people who are against gay marriage has no bearing on my claim that opposing gay marriage creates victims. Whether it's a million people or three people, they're still wanting to make a group of people second class citizens. 
Yeah sure why not my evening is free.

This was cleared up like 3 episodes in, no character has a real voice, it's all the narrator's interpretation.   That being said, the fact that they couldn't get at least 3 or 4 actors to do voices is a huge bummer.
Thanks for the recommendation. We stopped by the showroom today and talked to a salesman, who seemed knowledgeable.  Did you have a four seasons room done by Desert Sun? If so, how old is it, and how well has it stood up to heat and cold? Any problems with planning, permitting, building or warranty?

No houses in downtown, plenty in the outer parts (Sunset, Richmond, etc). Keep in mind that's all within the 7 mile city limit.  That said, I don't think you need to live in a 3000sq ft house do you? At least not if you're young like the other commenter implied. Also you can commute from the East Bay via BART in less than 30 minutes, if you want a larger house for a lower price. Obviously nothing like Detroit prices, but with all the benefits of living in the Bay Area vs Detroit metro area.

HP is basic proof that Carly Fiorina should never be allowed anywhere near public office. Hell she should never work as an officer at any tech company again. She single-handedly destroyed both HP and (by merger) Compaq, and killed any cool tech that DEC had left. HP has been dead for years now. It just hasn't accepted it yet.

I'm playing the ps4 version and honestly, not bad. Story is kinda confusing at first. Gameplay is awesome, does a good job of making you feel like you are in SAO. Fairly nice freedom of choice when it comes to weapon choosing, can even change out your companion that quests with you. Packed with an ass of content. Dialogue is my only gripe, it can be cheesy and a little too much at times, like kirito catches one of the characters working at a cafe in a maid uniform, it was so bad I had to skip through it honestly.

I think it is simply their desire to neither be ruled by others nor to rule over others. Considering how much bloodshed and destruction throughout history (and throughout the present) has been caused by people who desperately want power over others, I think this is not only a very reasonable position to take, but one that other communities and regions would do well to embrace also.   They don't want to be ruled by the government, so they don't support them. They don't want to be ruled by the FSA, so they don't support them. But they also don't want to rule over all of Syria, so, as you say, they don't create a third faction with such a goal which would cause them to have to fight each of the first two factions.   I believe it isn't that they want independence from Syria per se as much as they simply don't want to be ruled. And I think they are sincere with their statements that they would like to see all of the communities, ethnicities and religions in Syria have the same level of autonomy that the Kurdish communities are fighting to maintain -- and that they would be an ally to any people in the region who were fighting for similar goals.

What is discussed is the parent comment at hand  The community dialogue changes depending on what thread you choose to add comment to and your comment should contribute to the ongoing discussion of that comment thread.  I'm not going to link the context because I don't honestly think you're going to listen to anything anyway.  You're completely misconstruing what I'm saying and putting meaning where I didn't say it.  Just look over the whole context from the first parent comment and then the comments that follow and ask yourself if his one line opinion that doesn't answer the question posed is still not worthy of downvotes.  I'm going to be bowing out of this discussion as I don't see a point in continuing further you are so stuck in your thinking.

Well that's a very comprehensive question.  Actually multiple questions.  I can give you a few storylines I'd like to see. They're going to make 3 Batman movies with Ben Affleck and I would like to see one of those movies be a dedicated and nasty Joker story.  Maybe an adaptation of The Killing Joke or maybe the Joker graphic novel.  I really want to see Jared Leto's Joker interact with Affleck's Batman on a deeper level than just their stunt doubles in a car chase scene. I would also like to see new takes on old villains and to see some villains we've never seen in live action before.  I'd love to see one of the Batman movies include Ventriloquist.  I'd also love to see a Jason Todd/Red Hood storyline but who wouldn't? Other characters I hope to see...Black Manta, Poison Ivy, Bane, Bizarro, Parasite, Clayface, Grodd, Mr. Mind, Hugo Strange, The Black Mask, Chung Tzu (aka Egg Fu), Mary Marvel/Black Mary, The Black Hand, Monsieur Mallah and The Brain,  White Martians.

Get rid of mode selection entirely, toss everyone in a single queue, and once the game starts let people vote on the mode.  Only drawback is that people might whine in-game if they don't get the mode they wanted, but there needs to be a point where the answer is 'deal with it.'

From my past spending. Remember, comfortable is different for everyone.
Mounted police are highly effective in large crowd control situations, esp in rioting etc. Though that's generally not an issue on 6th street.  Also, studies have shown that people respond more positively to mounted police than they do police on foot.... http://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/mounted-police-uk.html  *In neighbourhood settings, mounted police patrols are associated with higher levels of visibility, trust and confidence in police.*

Eventually you grow up and get tired of taking all the bull shit nobody should be an asshole and if they are they should be treated as one. I usually let most things go but sometimes you've got to let them know where you stand. 
That sounds  like intellectual dishonesty.  You know everything about it but you come here into the echo chamber where very few would even give you a difference in opinion. Everyone here is going to essentially agree with you. If that's all you're looking for just pull the trigger and leave him.  You snooped on him and rationalize it as OK because he shouldn't have anything to hide. That's bothers me. It sounds like you didn't accidentally find it.  At least if you asked the other side of the equation you could get a cross flow of dialogue instead you close you ears and head to the part of the Internet that would think he's a monster.  Jesus, just leave him.   Since we're editing. I'm not saying you snooped because youre a girl I'm suggesting you snooped because you had a question in your gut that made you feel insecure. This isn't an argument for gender dynamics or stereotypes. Neither do I endorse or even like trp idealology.

Don't worry about being caught up in this.  IF there are no fees for selling (and you should check. I didn't see any on their website, but like I said, I could have missed them), then all it's cost you is time, really. And, even if there are fees for leaving early, it often makes sense to pay those fees in order to avoid the ongoing fees of a high MER.  Come back with the numbers, if there are any, and people here can do the math for you.  You do have plenty to learn and, like I said, I suggest you read a great deal of the entries on the CCP blog, as well as coming to this subreddit often and at least skimming lots of the submissions on investing.  To briefly touch on your questions:  &gt;because I thought I would need it for down payment on a new car or something after I graduate from college.  First off, don't buy a new car, and especially don't finance a car.  Cars rapidly depreciate in value, it's a much better financial decision to get a car that's 2 to 4 years old, and invest the difference.  The only good reason to buy a brand new car is if you're an enthusiast, and in that case you're probably buying some decked out Impreza or a classic, so....  It's good that the advisor gave you a survey about what risk you're comfortable with and what your goals are, though.  Do you understand the positive relationship between risk and returns, though?  Do you know that if things fall in value, that this is temporary and actually *positive* in the long run?   Volatility is the price of higher returns.  Hopefully that was explained.  &gt;I just want to know my next steps. I'm currently a few weeks in and the dip in the economy has resulted in a loss for my portfolio. Initially, I went in with intentions of doing GICs or High Interest Savings Account, are those better or worse compared to what I've invested in?   Everyone's portfolios are down, right now.  Mine is. The proper course of action in such a situation is to just keep contributing as you normally would, contribute *more* than you normally would, or if you are not making current contributions just to relax and let time take care of it.  GICs and HISAs are fine if you *need* the money for a planned purchase in the near term (less than 5 years, say).  For example, you are actively searching for a house to buy, and are keeping the down payment ready.  Or you know your car is on it's last few kilometers, and you want $10k ready for a new (used) one.  If you've some flexibility, your portfolio is fine.  You want to get a bit of returns while you are saving up for that down payment, but you don't *have* to buy one, so that if your portfolio falls in value you can pass up a house you'd otherwise buy.  If you're saving for the long term, GICs and HISAs make no sense.  And a conservative portfolio should only be used if you are very risk averse or quite a bit older and your income from labour is going to be dropping off in a few years.  So, there's not really better or worse, here.  Just different products for different goals.  And, just to clear something up, when I say a "conservative portfolio like yours", that's still **not** a high-fee portfolio like you currently own, I mean a portfolio with that sort of bond-equity allocation, but with much lower fees.  &gt;Is it better to generally learn the market on your own and invest on your own, to avoid these "conflict of interest" scenarios?  Absolutely.  It's very easy to learn, and doing so will save you a great deal of money over the next 80+ years of your life.  &gt;Regarding the high commission fee. When do I have to pay that fee/when is that deduced/how is it deducted? And That's calculated based on the initial investment, right?   It's ongoing.  What's important is that you stop paying it.  So, how do you go about actually dumping these silly funds you are currently in?  There's plenty of options.  1) You can open up an account with a discount brokerage such as Questrade, transfer your money over from TD, and buy the appropriate funds for your risk tolerance.  2) You can open up an account with a service like WealthSimple or WealthBar, and transfer out the money from the TD account.  Option 1 is the more complex one, but the fees are slightly lower.  Option 2 may be better for you, if learning how to DIY doesn't interest you, or you suspect you might be the sort of dude who gets worried when his portfolio drops a bunch in value.  There are other options like TD Waterhouse mutual funds, though I don't see the value in them over an ETF portfolio, and Tangerine funds, but they are still over a 1% MER and for that you may as well be using an advisor service like WealthBar or WealthSimple, IMO, and they are cheaper to boot.  What you want to *not* do is withdraw the money from your TFSA.  You need to transfer directly to another TFSA.  If you withdraw from the TFSA, you don't get that contribution room back until January 1st.  If I missed anything lemme know.

Fuck you, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the shit. It has fantastic music, beautiful production design and sets, entertaining, although hammy, acting from the adults while surprisingly good acting from the kids, and hilarious writing. My only real problem with the movie is Willy Wonka's backstory which just felt unnecessary but thats my only complaint.
ahh lame
Baby's babble loud randomly. I'd rather not wear plugs all the time. Also if a baby is screaming or irritable it's because they're tired, hungry, or have a dirty diaper. Giving them a nap, feed them or changing there diaper will 9/10 stop the noise.
On the flip side..  My girlfriends car had basically killed itself. She didn't have cash in hand that second to buy a car over 5k. So  she put down 2k then financed the rest. Now, she's been essentially putting down a payment and a half each month (sometimes more) to get it paid off faster. It does work out sometimes. But not a recommended idea. 
Wow, this was a long CMV! Let me try to respond here. Context: I'm an amateur music writer (write for The 405, Sputnikmusic, and now Popmatters), and love Christgau for the most part.  What Christgau did, first and foremost, was strip all the navel-gazing and meaningless pretention and art-for-art's-sake from music reviewing. He brought serious, punchy criticism into the realm of popular music, and allowed for level-headed appraisal of music that older critics would have snootily disregarded.  What I see you arguing, for the most part, is that he embodies a certain pettiness and sleaziness that's super undesirable in a critic, especially now. I'm not going to deny that in some cases. However, I don't think he's just poking fun at Doherty's drug addictions or Morrison's reputation for the most part - I see it as informing the music he's writing about. When he mentions Doherty's "powder-sniffing," he's doing so in the context of what makes their album great, and when he mentions Morrison's "slimeball" nature, he's doing so to explain what either makes the album unenjoyable or great (LA Women, for example).  Here's where I think we diverge: it's impossible to totally separate the art and the artist - i.e. take the art in a total vacuum. This is pretty obvious in extreme examples, obviously - like, it's kinda tough to enjoy the Cosby Show now, and it's tough to listen to Lostprophets now that Ian Watkins has been convicted of pedophilia. However, in subtler cases the artist informs the art as well. This can be negative - try listening to Mark Kozelek's misanthropy without thinking of his general shittiness and occasional misogyny - and positive - would *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* have been quite so impressive without Kanye's general publicness and loudness?  And, obviously, it's possible - I know plenty of people who love Sun Kil Moon regardless of Kozelek's public actions. But not every critic wants to do that. Christgau is going to take the artist along with the art, though I don't think he really ever takes the artist in the art's *stead*, but I think they are impossible to extricate from one another. Occasionally, this is more obscure - the KoRn review, for example - but I think that even in those reviews the tone of the surrounding material almost "makes" the music: it's a shitty aesthetic, and that shittiness extends through to the music as well (image above boring "death-industrial," leading to boring and dumb music).  And, yeah, occasionally his stuff is unwarranted. His Karen O thing is bad, which is why I think that having someone like Jess Hopper in command of P4K is important (even if I generally dislike her writing and self-importance). However, he's a caustic dude in a largely caustic-dude-centric field - I won't forgive him for his sexism, but I can at least understand where it comes from.  So, in conclusion: Christgau is great primarily because of how he transformed music writing, especially in how he (IMO) tastefully balances art and artist. Nitpicking like you're doing there is fair, but it's a little like nitpicking DJ Shadow's *Endtroducing.....* for sounding a little dated in 2015 when all the 2015 instrumental hip-hop wouldn't exist without it. He's praised largely for his influence, especially in terms of tone and brevity, and for that I have to give him the credit he's due.

yeah that sounds about right. I could also see them doing a cop-out by ranking gobert-favors-hayward back to back to back (like 41, 40, 39) so they can say "omg the young core of utah we didnt know where to put them?!?!? LOLOMG!!!"

I'm about to go camping for the second time in 2 days and after the first time I went, the one thing which I felt I was lacking was light. I found this on Amazon and from the amount of light it gives I think it will be satisfactory!   http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00LI84Z7M?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00  It's a pretty awesome concept to be able to charge it on the go manually (even though I will have a power bank)

&gt; My bad assumption, sorry.   It's okay. No harm done. :)  &gt; Goodpoint about the startrek.com references.  Thanks. I suppose, if I was really challenged on the issue of my lack of sources, I would point to StarTrek.com itself as my source. The official website for Star Trek, owned and operated by the primary owner of the rights to Star Trek, has to be taken as a very strong guide to what is and is not canonical. And that's where I "sourced" my information about CBS's canon policy from. 
Obviously those were all quick summations, "anti-immigration," in the fleshed out model, refers more to a system based on intellectual merit instead of physical characteristics (we happily welcome people with any colour of skin, if they believe in gender equality and eschew anti-intellectualism, for example).   Pro-nuclear  is essentially a stop gap measure intended to prevent the delay of existing and winding up nuclear projects. Being anti-nuclear is de facto pro coal/oil/gas, as current renewables such as solar and wind cannot provide baseload power, but nuclear  in combination with renewables provides a very flexible grid. Pro-nuclear also means not quashing further nuclear research, which will lead us to nuclear fusion which we'll absolutely need to power the second half of this century. So we'd actually be working to avoid your peak uranium scenario. Nuclear waste is obviously a serious issue, but in classic human fashion, it's all about kicking the can down the road. The industrial revolution has kicked us the can of carbon emissions, and we have to deal with that right now or face destruction. We'll have to deal with nuclear waste, too, but we desperately need to avoid the pending acidification of the oceans and a whole host of other issues that come with  a warming climate.  Geothermal, hydro, renewable, and fusion power will hopefully supplement nuclear fission so that we only need it for one generation. 
Technically, all those abilities are still dashes, since there is a travel path and travel time, you are physically on intermediate points while moving (as opposite to blink, when you just appear in target location with zero travel time), you are considered moving and everything that depends on your movement or position applies for all intermediate points (like auras). You can even stop Vi ult by killing her before she connects (that's kind of hard though). Also, I forgot Hecarim ult, it's also a dash that can pass over Azir wall.  I tested J4 ult and it's indeed strange interaction. It looks like he'll be stopped by knockback but can freely jump over wall that already stands still.
I think based on what people (Kass, Trish, Varner) have said a lot of people (myself included) have changed their opinion on her, it seems that she doesn't have a very good social game at all. For example, apparently during Cagayan she would tell people that god already decided that she would win. She just doesn't seem like a good player.

For the first, the how did they say "vertical angles theorem?" What linked them to that?  Also, vertical angles are congruent, though, right? So did he not get that right because he didn't say the theorem?  The third one still doesn't make sense to me. I guess I'm not seeing how all of the different theorems relate together.  Thanks a ton :)

The thing that frustrates me is that it often seems like an all or nothing discussion. We can't pay for A so take it from B.   It's normally people just saying stuff like "how come the people support killing other people but they don't want to take care of the people around them?" Super leading questions with no realization of how government spending works.   I'd much rather see someone give a really good informed analysis, "we have this much X in our current military that provides X, Y, Z. If we cut by 10%, XYZ the abilties of XYZ would still be mainted at 95% and we can then look at using those savings elsewhere."
Makes sense.

I like how the article never really explains how the Wildest Dreams video is channeling white colonialism. It just says that it is and then bam, article over.
Our city tried that, and all it resulted in was people dumping trash in their neighbours yards or at industrial dumps or on the side of the road to avoid the fines. We even got bins for compost to reduce the amount of food waste in garbage bags for more space, still not enough.   Amazing how people will put effort into avoiding trash reduction through illegal means instead of just recycling.

"The possibilities are limitless," says the trailer.  Let's run the permutations.  Take together all the different combinations of the tiers for the [Day One Edition](https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/284036/deus-ex-mankind-divided-day-one-edition-pc-download) and we've got 12.  Multiply that by 3 since we have three system options: 36.  The [Collector's Edition](https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/289213/deus-ex-mankind-divided-collectors-edition-pc) (which doesn't include the 4-day-early release) has 9 possible combinations.  9 * 3 = 27.  Add that to the Day One Edition and we get 63.  There are 63 different ways you can preorder Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and that's only if all the tiers get unlocked.  63 ≠ ∞.  Edit: Turns out the Collector's Edition includes all preorder bonuses listed; no tier system.  Meaning you've only got 3 options there.  3 + 36 = 39.  So there are even fewer "possibilities" than before.
Not really. I'm sure it was initially awqward for him asking a random person about book reading but I'm quick at picking up social queues so I turned it into a nice talk. If he asked someone who wasn't good at social situations then I'm sure it would get awqward real fast

I think they really had a tough job this season.  Everyone compared them to the old judges and complained why we had new ones.  But it was obvious that there needed to be an un-bias perspective from the 3 judges to critique returning superstars.  Not only that, but its so hard to critique those who are already deemed "champions" by the show.  How do you criticize them without basically defaming the idea that they are "champions", in which the show focuses so much attention on.  I feel the critiques came off too light because of that, and also because of lack of experience I'm sure.  But overall I thought they did a good job, Frankie definitely surprised me and gave the most cohesive and understandable notes.  I almost wish at the end that the judges got to decide who the winner was, because we would've actually received, imo, a more fitting champion for this season.  No hate on Quest, i love them.  But if I were to isolate my bias to them and look solely on who really grew and worked on pushing boundaries, I don't think I could confidently crown them.   But the judges, I think they did a fair job.  Congrats to T-Pain, Teyana and Frankie.  Good season guys!

I would suggest speaking to the mother about the kids staying with you and your SO full time and she get weekend visitations. It does sound like she pretty much wants to be a "baby sitter mom" from what you've described. While she may love her kids, she doesn't want to really be a mother. If she doesn't agree to this, I would still talk to a lawyer or mediator about you and SO having full custody!

I understood that part. Exponent of the derivative operator acts like a shift operator (can be seen from Taylor series expansion).   What I did not get is, how this "shift operator" that is inside the integral was able to act on the dirac delta function which is outside the integral.   Can I just move [;\delta(x);] inside the integral because [;\delta(x);] can be considered to be a constant as far as the stuff within the integral is concerned?
You'll note that Gamaliel neglects to mention that it is also at "Sea Lions of Wikipedia" - a blog made by GamerGhazi - and was in fact put up there many hours before it emerged on WIA/KIA. In fact, [Mark Bernstein himself has commented there](https://archive.is/8Fu9S#selection-1619.14-1643.28), crying crocodile tears and trying to claim he is more valuable than Masem.  &gt;Moreover, perhaps it *is* significant that, if you have to choose one editor or another, with Bernstein you get lots of fixes in computer science and literature, and with Masem you get lots of fixes to Japanese children’s cartoon fandom. Which is more useful to the encyclopedia? (With Bernstein, you also have an editor who sometimes writes a grammatically-correct sentence with an active verb, and who isn’t using the encyclopedia to spread stories about the sex lives of female software developers, but let that pass.)

I would recommend spending a week to max out the skill level on Echidna, then run Legendary Seaways to max out Kushinada skill, if you have at least 70% clear rate on Seaways. LKali, DKali, Muse, Kushinada, Echidna seems to be a solid team to me. 7 Skill-ups so you get Kushi active on the second turn, Echidna active on fourth.

I'm from farther north, and nobody really had AC there either, even though it was usually in the 80s (~30 C) most summers. It was pretty unpleasant. Worse, there were quite a few evenings when it'd drop to 50 (10 C), which just makes it that much harder to get used to the heat. But it's so hard to sleep when it's hot and humid.  Are you going in the summer? Are you going to be outside most of the time (like at Disney or Universal)?   If it's in the summer, then yes, expect that kind of temperature. It also rains a lot, usually either for a short amount of time mid-afternoon or a pretty sizable thunderstorm. In the winter, it's a pretty comfortable temperature and doesn't rain much.  If you're inside, there will be AC, and places are pretty good at keeping it at a comfortable temperature (unlike some places, where malls and restaurants crank it up so high you need a coat).

Then won't the argument be, that they have been in Germany so long, they are now citizens?

Crime has increased quickly in my country. People are tired of police being useless most of the time and when a thief is caught he is released after not too long.  Recently, news about groups of people around the city who had been doing justice by their own hands;  http://www.radiolavozfm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bellas-610x407.jpg  http://cde.peru21.pe/ima/0/0/1/0/5/105849.jpg  So, Ive been training (physically) for a while now, doing calisthenics and that kind of stuff. Im in shape and although Im not a bodybuilder I feel like im physically okay.  There is a bridge near to a college near my home. Students from there are usually target for the robbers and I feel that would be a good starting point. Im thinking about telling some guys from that college who are interested So basically what do you think what kind of skills or people are good for the job? should I recruit women too? Any ideas? (I doubt we can have guns but the whole vigilante thing is about being useful for your community no matter how you can help)
You are wicked cute! It's unbelievable that you were once that person in the middle picture. Congratulations on your transformation, it must have taken a lot of work and determination to get here!
Intake valves pull in air, so no they won't burn. There's very little to worry about with tight intake valves, other than it leans the mixture. I'd still get new spacers and adjust to spec though.   I adjust all my valves to the high end of spec.   As for your exhaust valves, you'll know if it's burnt/cracked by looking at the face of the valve.

Former legbeard.  I'm thankful none of my cringe-worthy behavior is as bad as some of these stories but I still get embarrassed when I think about how I used to be into 4chan or MLP to an unhealthy level.

I think they have the same impact in game, but Hai helps make his team better, and Bjergsen needs his team to make him better.

The individual in question is a srs regular and general internet power-sjw. They've long faced some pretty heavy accusations.

Now Milo is writing an expose on this in his Breitbart column, and is at least attempting to get some comments from the subject. It should be an interesting read at the very least.

Fair compromise between the two ideas there, thanks for the input.
of course there is "something" to go on. But this something is so small and irrelevant that I still label it as garbage compared to seeing reviews/opinions on the game after release. Raising your chances with the dice by 2% is not a reason to potentially waste money.

FNV is really bad at managing memory, so if you have a lot of thing in your inventory (like 1000s of ammo of every possible kind and all kinds of skillbooks and all kind of chems...), the game will need a huge amount of RAM to work properly.  If you can try to sell everything you don't use to a merchant of put it in a container insie a buidling (so the content is loaded into memory only when you enter the building)
Well to be really honest with you, the only played that I didn't want it to leave was Alex Sandro. Sure Jackson is a beast, but for someone that saw every Porto match, I know we can have better in that position, I don't know if it will be Aboubakar or not. In the other parts of the pitch we have better Wingers and Midfielders and ofc a huge improvement on the Goalkeeper.
Totally agree that smaller semi-vanilla servers are the best. I play on a small survival/economy server and have never looked back.
My husband and I live in Evanston, IL (20 minutes by train to downtown Chicago, very urban, vegan-friendly community).  We're both vegan and have 2 young vegan kids and 2 vegan dogs.

My graphic designer friend says these flags arnt going to work.  There is lots of reasons but there was one that stood out to me,  a flag design has to be noticeable when it is down,  when the wind isn't blowing. I dont think some of these can do that. And they have to be easy to make by hand.   I'm no expert,  but going on from what he was saying,  there is a lot more to it.

&gt; I have no idea how I could prove my mental disability, I haven't been tested since I was very young.  If it's a social-emotional mental disability, get a counsellor to confirm you still have the disability. If it's a learning disability or something a psychologist would diagnose, you're going to have more difficulty, because you'll need to get retested and it costs a lot.

Thanks for posting this.  I do remember reading this answer a while ago, but the features they mention are easily "faked".  Sure, Doc and Eddie may have some neatly scripted things they say regarding current happenings, which is all well and good - but I'm extremely doubtful that winning a meaningless AHL pre-season game at home in OT will generate a different response than game 7, Stanley cup winning goal at home in any NHL arena.

The team that lost most of those games doesn't exist, they changed the roster.  Do you think it's impossible for a team to improve over the course of a split with a smart roster swap and end up better than the person running 3rd in pure games won?
Roslin chuckled at his reaction when she had taken her shawl back. "Well I need it for other days... But I'll lend it if you ever wish to wear it." She grinned, then followed him into the passageways. It didn't seem long until they got to where they had first started. Roslin cupped his cheeks and returned the kiss, but hers was shorter. "And I hope we can share more.. Better ones." Her hands dropped from his cheeks, she was sure he knew what she meant by 'better ones'.   When the false wall opened itself, she stepped out into the room and waited for Sam to come out as well. "Well.. if you'd like." She wouldn't mind it, but allowed him to decide for himself. Her time with Sam was splendid, even if somethings, some desires, weren't fulfilled. Roslin just wondered if what they had done, despite only being the touch of lips and embraces, was a wise thing to have done, especially with the possibility that they might not even be betrothed. *Oh father...* She thought as she awaited Samwell's choice.

It is definitely hard,  there is always a bit of sketchiness to those sites. But there definitely are people who are normal and looking to meet nice guys. As much shot as people give it, I still really like Tinder, it doesn't feel like I'm totally in the dark when I talk to someone. I've even gotten long term relationships from it. Just an idea
I got married when I was 20 and the husband is 10 years older. 5 years later, my 25 year old self can tell he loves me , but definitely took full advantage of my inexperienced 20 year old self.  It isn't pretty when you are supposed to hold your marriage strong and learn to be in your first adult relationship all at once. 
Okay, now that we more or less agree on the current definition of vegan, the only question left is whether not killing "sentient beings" suits ethical framework better than "animals".  &gt;Sentience doesn't only require ability to sense, but a conscious experience of those senses  M-W defines *sentient* as  "responsive to or conscious of sense impressions". If something can feel and respond, it is sentient. This is different from consciousness or mental reasoning. So yes, it applies to both plants and animals.  &gt;My thought experiment was a hypothetical conscious plant  If you mean consciousness, it's a more abstract and difficult conversation as there is no broadly accepted scientific definition or understanding of consciousness. Presence/absence of brain/CNS does not imply consciousness either. There is no physiological root science have been to pin it down to...so you have to go with intuitive understanding (not definition).  &gt;My personal experience with talking to non-vegans is that it's been easier for me to explain my morals this way  If it works great, I'm all for any means to get the message through. I find that more people are conscious of health (what's in it for me) and sustainability (what's in it for my children), so I advocate from this perspective.

I'm in college and I don't do any of the stereotypical stuff like partying, clubbing, etc. Sometimes I'll think, "should I being doing that? Am I missing out?" but then I realize I have *NO INTEREST* in doing that at all. I do what I like and what makes me comfortable, and surround myself with people that have similar interests.  I don't worry about what other people are doing.  Yeah some people have tons of friends, are ultra fashionable, etc. etc.  But that's *them*, not *you.*

The worst part is I had the last 2 kicks of the game. I knew time was running out when I took a mark inside 50 so I played on and sprayed the shot out on the full. I then redeemed myself by intercepting the resulting free kick which is when the siren went. All in all it was either my best 15 seconds or worst 15 seconds in footy.

&gt;The reason feminists often discuss sexualization has nothing to do with anything inherently wrong with it, but due to the ubiquity and contextual inappropriateness of it.  Let's talk about that then. I'll be generous and assume you're talking solely about video games here because sexualized characters are far from ubiquitous in all other forms of media (and arguably in video games as well but for the sake of conversation I'll grant it to you).   First, lets think about what is *contextually appropriate* for a video game. As an convenient example we could look at Mika from Street fighter. What is the context here? We could look at her profession -professional wrestling- for context. As noted in another comment chain a google image search for female professional wrestlers gives a lot of contextual support for her highly sexualized outfit (note, she is not a luchador, she's a professional wrestler in the American/Japanese style.)   But we can go deeper than that. On a more fundamental level, Mika is an avatar for us, the player, to interact with the game world. This is not just any game world, this is the world of a fighting game. In that context, players will want avatars that are powerful and skilled. You would expect most avatars to be idealized depictions of the human form with a sprinkling of joke characters depending on the franchise. Does Mika's design make sense in this context? I would argue that a healthy figure, bright eyes, developed skills, and sexual desirability are all aspects of the idealized female form.  Thus, Mika's design makes sense on two different contextual levels: as a professional wrestler, and as an idealized avatar.   Onward to ubiquity. The claim is that there is a ubiquitous portrayal of women as being sexually desirable in video games, and that the issue is the aggregate. You bring up a hypothetical constant portrayal of black people as thugs and criminals as an example, which would have obvious negative repercussions. The analogy falls apart, however, when stretched to include being sexually desirable. Being a criminal is a negative trait. Being considered sexually desirable is commonly seen as a positive trait. It doesn't follow that exposure to lots of sexy women would have a negative impact on women. 
Exactly. But now lots of people are gonna keep bringing this up like it's a fact, the way they did before.

As the old saying goes "Braga prays, Porto works, Coimbra studies and Lisbon has all the fun" Here are some stereotypes in my opinion (I could be wrong though):   People in the north are typically seen as being more religious and I've always been told by "the old folks" that the people in the north work a lot harder than the ones in the south. But then again I'm from the north so... People in Alentejo have their own subset of jokes in Portugal all of them making fun of how lazy they are (e.g. Two alentejanos are sitting by the porch when one if them spots a 50€ note on the ground 10 meters away. He turns to his friend and says "look compadre, if the wind changes direction we've won the day")  Algarve is always full of beefs (nickname we have for brits) People in Lisbon are seen as a bit posh   I don't remember any specific stereotypes for the islands apart from own different their accent is and is sometimes made fun of.

what people normally mean when they say friendzone, is a negative connotation, to describe a situation where person A is romantically interested in person B, but person B just thinks of them as friends and is not romantically or sexually interested in A.  it's not normally used to simply describe people that are your friends. like I wouldn't consider my friend Steve or my friend Andrea to be "friendzoned" by me, we're just friends.  now if Andrea and I met and she wanted to date me, but I just wanted to be friends, that's more of a "friendzone" situation (in the way the word is commonly used)

I'm a bisexual male in a relationship with a homosexual male.  The phrase "homosexual lifestyle" was conjured up to denigrate homosexuals, as if to say that their tendencies were some kind of deviant, learned behavior. It weaved its way into the discourse and now well-intentioned people sometimes use it without really considering what it really means. But it's dying out, slowly but surely.

Rumour has it that humans need to eat. 
Do you not understand how wide the variation is within the American middle class is, though?  People are matching up in a similar culture and class level, not simply economic and educational status though. For example, a girl could come from a middle class family and culture, can have education and earning power below another career oriented middle class lawyer type, who concentrated more on future earning power in school. But, culturally, they are probably about the same - they get the same references, grew up in the same types of households, and so forth.
I could have sworn that the robot-armed Insurrectionist and the knife chick Insurrectionist were both still alive. Robot Arm was knocked into the ocean by Maine's shots, but was very much alive. Knife chick was also alive when she fell in, though bouncing off the side of the dock could have broken her back, possibly leading her to drown. Still, of all the Insurrectionists we met, those two are the most likely to still be alive. If Robo-Arm could survive a MAC shot and only lose an arm and both he and Sharkface survive a building collapse, they can survive getting knocked into water

While I agree with you that it's possible he faked it (I still think he did fake it), seizures are technically listed as a rare but possible opioid withdrawal symptom. It is standard protocol to administer phenytoin to detox patients to prevent seizures but I think that it is more for the chance of the patient lying about not using short acting benzodiazepines, which could have already cleared their system before an initial tox screen was run.   I also want to point out that Alysha is smart enough to know what a grand mal seizure is. Just because she knew what it was and how to handle it doesn't mean she's actually seen nick have one.

It doesn't matter *why* men are most attracted to women in their mid-20s (and the article does touch on the optimal fertility issue), the fact is that there aren't enough 25 year old women to go around. It's supply vs demand.  That's what makes it unrealistic.

1) Assuming that you are not a hunter, use Defender/Void Walker.  2) It sounds like you don't have a void primary? That would help a lot, but if not use you secondary almost exclusively. Be *one of those gaurdians*.  3) Use a void secondary that you are most comfortable with. When I got Thorn I was a hunter with no void primary, but I just used (void) Plug One constantly and got the bounty done fast enough. But I'm not a bad PvP player.  4) Use a void heavy too. Know when heavy is coming 1 minute ahead and plan accordingly.  5) Focus on staying alive and getting kills in void ways.

Instead of trying to counter-snipe him, I kept being Medic and ran across the bridge, strafing to avoid his shots, and took him out with my Blutsauger. After killing him, he said over voice chat "Well, I never expected to get rushed by a Medic, of all people".
You understood my reference.

But the original guy said archon was less hype, which is subjective.
&gt;In PS I'll have the main _d map with each element as a separate layer, then the _s and _i maps as grouped layers on top. That way I can move around and pick what I want shiny or illuminated. For the _s and _i map elements, Layer Blending options are a quick, great cheat like Stroke, Outer/Inner Glow etc.  Thank you Ryan!  I'm such a stupid person.  I have been (for whatever reason) keeping my _s, _n, and _d (etc.) under separate PSD files.  I SHOULD BE LAYERING THEM IN THE SAME FILE!!!!  Thanks again for talking through your workflow.  I'm very familiar with _i maps as I've tried to make a lamp or two so far but was just thinking on your OP that you illuminated some sides and portions of your walls that wouldn't be just "windows" so it made me think the way I was doing it would be harder.  I just needed a silly very elementary reminder on using layers!  :)  Thanks for your response!
This is the main reasoning why DRG/TRUE are listed above huk/MC on liquipedia, but they both advanced in 1st technically.

MGS5 may just be good enough that it won't matter if you liked the series before. If they get the multiplayer right, with the invading of bases and Metal Gear Online, then it could be arguably one of the best and most complete games out there.  I think MGS5 probably has the greater potential "upside" if you take the chance, whereas Gears is a relatively safe choice since it's $40 and you know exactly what you're getting. I have Gears but am waiting for MGS since I'm no good with the Gnasher anymore and MGS seems likely to be a fresh game I will put many many hours into.
It's one of the top 10 most dangerous jobs in the country.
Okay, that's a little better. But you're still starting to resent this already. If you feel the way you do now, will it really get better in 10 years? If it were me, it would get worse, especially as the burdens of a family start to add up and fall on your shoulders.   Maybe you just need to talk to him more and explain that. I would hope if he loves you that he could at least try to see your side of it. 
So can we just call it him healing then?

Any major participant in World War II should be expected to receive a more thorough education on it.  After all, they were involved in every major skirmish in the pacific theater.  That being said, while the war may be covered thoroughly, atrocities committed by the Japanese army are not.  Japanese prime ministers regularly give very carefully calibrated statements of apology.  Generally, each apology is identical to the last, save for minor tweaks, some increasing the number of things being apologized for, some decreasing it.
"ass hats that would shit on him if he had been from NA" literally what the fuck are you talking about?
How does gut flora make it through the biofilter? I think the biofilter can distinguish between symbiotic and parasitic microorganisms, and I think ~~mitochondria~~ midiclorians were described as symbiotic in star wars.

If you can't return the clubs, you'd probably recoup most of what you paid if you sell them brand new instead of lightly used.  The ladies clubs are probably fine to learn on, except that the shafts are likely shorter than standard men's clubs.  This could make it harder for you to learn the correct posture and set-up if you're much taller than the average woman.

I came here to say this. I'm happy we aren't the only ones. 
it's safe to say that if you actually average over 30 kills per game and still lose constantly, that you are doing something TERRIBLY wrong.

Well look at this guy.  Fine. Given more information about your situation your attitude, although egregiously rude, is understandable. I didn't *know* from one three word sentence that you were one of the people I actually hope my flights are stocked with, because I fly a bit too.  I don't take business class because i am very compact and would rather spend the money on a room that isn't *obvious* about the fact that the bed is likely covered in ejaculate.  So a few things:  1) I envy you. I love flying and wish i could do it every day.  2) At least your bags aren't the size of a small moon.  and 3) At least you don't have a baby with you. Presumably.  May the skies be forever friendly, and let me know if lightning ever strikes a plane that you are in. I've heard that they drop for less than a minute like the Vomit Comet. I've always wanted to ride that thing.

It would save them from using as much plastic, and with the volume they deal with, any way they can use lesser materials (plastic or rubber, or labels, etc) is 100% worth it.  It now uses (making up these numbers of course just for example) 50 grams of plastic per bottle instead of 100 grams (by making the bottle walls thinner, a different shape that holds more volume, etc).  Since they buy plastic at $0.001 a gram, they are saving 5 cents per bottle made. Multiple that by the 100 million bottles a year they make, and they are now saving 5 million dollars a year.  So its definitely worth doing. Its the same thought process that makes food products shrink but stay the same price at fast food restaurants (the big crunch at KFC has seriously shrunk about 45% in the last ten years).

I fucking love that fish isn't releasing absolutely busted gods out of the gate because he knows they'll be popular, it seems like he's been trying to release balanced stuff out of the gate. I agree that he needs to work on the fine tuning, because both of his gods were super undertuned initially, which leads to these bandwagons, but Ravana is in a good place right now I feel; which as has been covered isn't enough to be competitive, but we don't need to arbitrarily buff gods to be competitive, coming from a Guan main who has legit seen Guan in a competitive game once, we need to nerf major characters so choices are less obvious. There'll always be power picks and that's fine, but there's so rarely any wiggle room away from those power picks.  I have no doubt Xian Ting will be in a good place in time. As long as the completely ridiculous over the top shit stops being released so regularly, it'll be a lot less painful to get currently overpowered gods to a good level.

I just don't see any evidence that we will run out of resources before we are close to 100% renewable (in energy and materials) or mining planets and asteroids.  Even running out of so-called necessary resources would likely only lead to innovation and new technologies using other materials.  There have been plenty of ominous predictions in the past with much more "evidence" that have been not come true.

If it's worth it to you, try what I did. I got two identical sample packs and busted one open directly. The first batch lasted three weeks, while the second one steeped.

Ehhhh, I dunno. For the sake of full disclosure, I'm at 300, I've got all heroes and alts, and two training bays.   A few days ago, I had about 1,000 silver. I had trained my last whatever up to something, and that was the end of it. So I've got a big training lineup.   So I Flight Decked hard, all day errday, visited all my allies, and got myself up to a million silver.   Next I accidentally trained Quake from lvl 14 to 15. oyyyyyyyyy   So it was back to the flight deck all day errday. I've sold off most of my extra items for silver. Sometimes you just run out.   There's enough silver in Flight Decks and allies to keep you going. It's hard; it's supposed to be hard.   Not to play devil's advocate, but I think there's enough.

I mean, they realize that all they're doing is giving cops a legitimate fear of black men right?   They're increasing the chances of more police shootings of young black men.   But I suspect that that's their goal anyway to give them "justification" to go on the killing spree they've always wanted. 
Well the way the offline (base old games) worked was that you could max your skills out eventually. but probably not in this version at the moment at least, some skills are more useful then others but none make you non viable.
Obviously, it's best to stay away from Clip fed blasters, as a young child will shred darts trying to force them to close and fire.  I would also stay away from anything motorized or air powered unless you use Lipo packs and have some way to regulate the air powered blasters. Even then it's expensive upkeep wise.  Personally, I would stick to front loaders, like Crossfire Bows, Roughcuts, Firestrikes, and the like.

I know that "privilege" is a dirty word on reddit, but this is exactly it. It's so easy for many white people to just not notice what minorities go through *because we have the privilege of not seeing it* unless we specifically seek it out.

DTRPG didn't pull the title. They talked to the publisher and the publisher pulled it. The publisher is free to publish it again later if they want to though.  Keep in mind that the staff at DTRPG aren't publishing things. Publishers have accounts and once they have a history with DTRPG they can publish titles on their own. DTRPG is just the delivery system publishers are using.  So in this case a publisher published something, the internet blew up and yelled at DTRPG who then talked to the publisher who pulled the product.  I think this is why it's better to direct ire at the publisher itself. They're in control of publishing and taking down content and they can modify current and future content if it's offensive.

Same here, took a month long road trip a while back. Female in her mid 20's. Camped and slept at rest stops, only got a hotel a handful of times. I just couldn't see the point in shelling out $50 for a bed for 6 hours.  Never once was I bothered. I just made sure to be smart about it, picked one that was well lit with lots of cars that had towels in the windows.  There was only one stop I pulled in and pulled right out, it was almost empty and I just had a bad feeling about it. Mostly I just met amazing and friendly people.

I've always liked older guys. At 19 I had a FWB relationship with a 38 year old and wound up becoming great friends and moving in together platonically after he got a girlfriend. I look at guys my own age and see babies. Normally shoot for the mid-late 20s and early 30s isn't totally uncommon for me.  I don't think I act my own age very often though.

I'd say that depends. For example, I took a clep recently on sociology. I know a lot of the information because it crossed over with psychology, my major. I read the book from library to get the names and little things. Passed it. If you're full out studying, then maybe take the class. Unless you really really don't want to take the class. There are a ton of resources out there for clep tests. 
still good :)

"Accounts"? Look, fact is you came at me taunting with your bullshit "hurdur u got banned now ur mad" when it's crystal clear that leveling takes too fucking long despite what you personally think, and Riot just confirmed that. If you enjoy sitting on your computer for 15 hours a day leveling your accounts in 1 1/2 weeks, good for you, but guess what, you're an exception, people have lives, have jobs, other hobbies and you don't need taunt them or try to argue just because they are not willing to waste their free time in the same way you do it. I'm just glad Riot is finally acknowledging this while you're at the other end of the spectrum.
Not only that, the Lakers were rusty in Game 1. 10-game layoff after sweeping the Spurs, while Philly just got back from a 7-game series. You'd expect that they'd be tired, but they were a grind-it-out team and thrives in those situations. Add AI being spectacular before the rest of the Lakers caught up, and you have a Game 1 upset.  That's the only way I can reconcile things to not still get upset over that game. I still can't re-watch it to this day.

I don't think I can every know whether or not a diety exists, but I know with 100% certainty that if one does, it isn't any I've ever heard of. Therefore I don't believe in any gods.

Like others have said, we don't having many concrete details about character customization. That said, I highly doubt that you'll be able to create a character with an entirely/mostly cybernetic body. While cybernetic prosthesis has been talked about at quite a bit and will almost certainly be in the game, one receives prosthetics as a result of severe trauma and it factors into the death/health of a spaceman mechanic. One of the main factors of death of a spaceman is that your character can only suffer so many injuries and can only be rebuilt so much before the body gives out and they die permanently. This would not be the case if your whole body could be rebuilt cyberneticly. As such I don't think you'll be able to walk around as an android or robot with a human brain.

Have you ever looked at those charities. They are shams, usually associated with the people organizing the event. I saw one which donated to a "non profit" for overweight teenage girls. No donation amount listed. Ok sounds alright, too bad there was absolutely no info in existence about the group besides this name on the website of the run.   They are just money making schemes.
He's many things, but i don't think hes an idiot.
Also, you mention Wages, in house technology and big game voice actors. Star Citizen has EVERY one of those costs.   You have no idea about people's wages so don't mention it. They essentially created their own engine, they have big name voice actors for SQ42 and they have impressive face capture technology.   Let me repeat this. I am not slighting CIG development skills. I think they're doing a great job. But thinking this game gets made for $80 million is a dream.

My original statement does not conflict with the statements that followed. Of course if an election takes place and there is only 1 voter, you should vote.  In your example, if you can get together 3000 of those 10 000 voters to vote in unison then that sounds like a great idea. But the actuality of the situation is that getting 30% of all voters together to vote in unison is impractical.  You are sucked in and brainwashed by the ploy, "you can make a difference." The truth is that your vote doesn't affect the outcome of an election. Your 0.00001% of the presidential election votes will never turn overcome the tide. Now if everyone was forced to vote, it would be a different story because non-voters certainly vote differently than regular voters.  In the end, it's a popularity contest. Who can put the most signs on lawns throughout a city. Who is the most well spoken. Who is more handsome.

I was disappointed in how small many of the cities seemed. I remember hearing Bethesda hyping the game up by saying that there would be way more than just 1 imperial city sized city. And when the game came out there were only 2 big ones... The others rival the small towns in oblivion
No.
That is incredibly accurate.
Not sure I agree with the win more sentiment. Win more, to me, generally refers to playing cards that are powerful when you already have inevitability on your side. Midrange Hunter generally feels like you're in the beat down role and the opponent is just hoping to stabilize before the game ends. Inevitability is usually on the opponents side.  Moreover against aggro you aren't playing many taunts, so you don't have inevitability on your side there either.   My problem with Ram is that the bad draws are just way too bad. Getting a Stonetusk Boar is just crippling. For a deck that looks to clock the opponent by turn 6, I'd rather just play a Tiger or Loatheb which is guaranteed to accelerate the clock. 
It's like this constant circle jerk. We know. Go ahead and mention people who don't tip, too.
Well I wouldn't mind if I never saw another lighthouse!  But looking at the new page now, I think we're a bit overloaded with the riddles.  I appreciate the inventiveness and effort that goes into some of these rounds (I've even done some myself in the past), but would prefer if they were the exception used to switch things up a bit rather than the rule.
You haven't made it clear anywhere whether you were still hanging out with this other guy while you were official or serious your (now) ex. Which makes it seem increasingly likely that you were hooking up with other guy while cultivating a "real" relationship with your (now) ex. Presumably, you didn't discuss exclusivity, because you don't mention discussing exclusivity, BUT you knew that he was a "traditional" guy, while you're not traditional (multi-dating is fine as long as everyone is informed and on-board, which doesn't sound like was the case here) and that makes your behavior less forgiveable.
No shit, past memorial day I just lazed around watching a Drunk History marathon, while the actual "history" channel was playing Storage Swamp Truckers or something.

Did you send out invites from both the website and app? If you did, the ones from the website reserve the slots and will prevent the app invites from joining. The website invites are "reserved", while the app invites are first-come-first-serve.  To use the app invites, go to the Owner Info / Members page and make sure that the empty fields at the bottom for the new teams are blank. Any information in those fields reserves the teams and requires you to use the website based invites.

A fighter jet's radar works like sonar, it fires a pulse and listens for the echo.  Things in the fighter world move so quickly that when the echo comes back it comes back a different frequency just like how a train's horn sounds higher pitched as it's coming towards you and as it moves away from you the pitch gets lowered. A fighter jet's radar sometimes has to look at targets below it which means the majority of the returns are going to be from the ground passing below it; since the jet knows how fast it's going and it knows what frequency it's radar operates at it can determine what frequency the radar return will be by determining how much it will have doppler shifted.  It will then ignore all returns that are close to that range

I would very strongly recommend this option. If you have cloth-wrapped wires, you definitely want to pull new wires. But if you do that, there are a lot of other changes that you can do at the same time. They won't cost much more, but there is no incentive for the seller to do these upgrades. So, you are much better off, if you are the one who sets the exact scope of the project.  I recommend making sure you have enough outlets. Modern building codes require outlets every couple of feet, and they do so for good reason. People have a lot more electrical devices than they used to have. A 50 year old house is likely to have way too few outlets.  Also, when installing outlets I strongly encourage you to put quads everywhere, instead of the regular duplex outlets (i.e. install a 2-gang box in put in two duplex outlets each). I personally prefer Decora over toggle style, but that's your call. In places where you expect to have a lot of devices (e.g. behind the TV, under the office desk, maybe even kitchen counter tops) put multiple quads. This way, you won't need to plug in tons of power strips. None of this should cost a lot at all.  If you are stringing new wires anyway, consider running CAT5e or CAT6 homeruns to some central location (e.g. garage or some closet). The material is about $30-50 dollars from Amazon (just try to find solid Copper instead of Copper-Clad-Aluminum), and you don't even need to hook it up to anything at this time. But you'll be happy if your electrician puts it into the walls for you at this time.  In the garage, install a 240V outlet next to the breaker panel. This costs only another $30 in parts, but it'll come in super handy if you ever need to plug in any high-powered tools. Your future contractors will thank you.  A 100A service is probably good for now. But it'll be a bit of a nuisance if you at some point have multiple electrical cars. And there is a decent chance that we'll all have those in the future. You won't be able to power quick chargers with just a 100A service. In fact, when we recently upgraded our electrical panel, we ended up getting 400A service for this very reason. Around here, that's become very common for new construction of bigger houses.  You can always install a new panel and new service later, but you'll save some money if you do everything in one go. It's really your call though. If money is tight, 100A service should serve you fine for at least the next couple of years.

Transfers- Similar to trades.  NFL operates on a weekly schedule of games.  Trades can be made from the start of the league year (sometime in March) until week 8 of the regular season (sometime in late October or early November). Players can be traded for other players or for future draft picks in the NFL draft (takes place in late April or early May).  Players can't be bought like in soccer.  Age- no set minimum age but NFL players have to be three years removed from High School which effectively makes the youngest players around 20 sometimes as young as 19.  Most NFL players play college football for the NCAA before they are eligible to play in the NFL.  Fixtures- The NFL has 32 teams organized into two 16 team conferences where each conference has four 4 team divisions.  Every team plays two games one at home and one away against the other  three teams in their division.  The other ten games of a season are comprised of ten individual opponents that they play only once and thus only play them at home or away.  The other ten games are broken down by playing two entire divisions for 8 games in total.  Teams play one division in the same conference as them and one in the opposing.  The last two games are decided by how last year's standings ended up.  I'll explain this with an example.  The New York Giants are in the NFC east and this year they already play the entire NFC south division as that is the NFC division they and the rest of the NFC east are scheduled to play.  The other two divisions are the NFC west and NFC north and the Giants final two games will come one from each division.  The Giants finished in third in the NFC East in 2014 so they play the 2014 3rd place finisher in the west and the north who is the Vikings and 49ers.  Hope this helps.

That silver grey color is what unfinished cedar looks like after a year or so of uv exposure. The wood itself does not rot, but it will shift to that color.   The way to prevent it is to coat it with a sealant thst contains uv inhibitors. Most outdoor finishes include something to keep this from happening.

Try laying on your back, legs slightly apart and relaxed. With. Finger either side of the shaft, move the testicles up towards your stomach slowly. You may have to move them around a little, but you'll find a point where they will go into the cavity. There may be a little discomfort finding the spot at first, but it shouldn't be painful. Once you get use to doing it, it will become a lot easier to do. You just need to find the right spot for your body.

I went to Morocco with a couple of friends but when I was there I spent a lot of time walking around Marrakech solo.

Sitting on the roof top of the Riad, at sunset during evening prayers..it's an extremely tranquil experience, well maybe not tranquil, magical, I don't know how to describe it but it was awesome.

 Well, take the 21 we've got on the list, throw in Eric Bledsoe, Mike Conley, Goran Dragic, Brandon Knight, Bradley Beal, Deandre Jordan, Rudy Gobert, Dwyane Wade, Draymond Green, Danny Green, George Hill, Nik Vuvecic, Tobias Harris, Nic Batum, Khris Middleton, Donatas Montieunas, Jonas Valanciunas, Kyle Lowry, Rudy Gay, Isaiah Thomas, Tristan Thompson, Tyson Chandler, Ty Lawson, Derrick Favors, Paul Millsap, Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, Demarre Carroll, Brook Lopez, Zach Randolph, Ricky Rubio, Andrew Wiggins, Marcin Gortat, Kenneth Faried, JJ Reddick, Jordan Clarkson, Dirk Nowitzki, Chandler Parsons, Trevor Ariza, Tyreke Evans, Taj Gibson, Nerlens Noel, Andre Drummond, Greg Monroe, Giannis Antetokoumpo, Tiago Splitter, Monta Ellis, Demar Derozan, Harrison Barnes, Michael Kidd Gilchrist, Wes Matthews, Andre Iguodala, Markieff Morris, Marcus Morris, Serge Ibaka, Reggie Jackson... alright, I'd list more guys but those aren't as open and shut.   The thing is, it's easy to come up with a huge list, because last season, Derrick Rose wasn't just not as good as he used to be, he was really bad. Literally any player who does something well and doesn't do something terrible to balance it out is better than Derrick Rose. Robin Lopez is. Anthony Morrow is. Ben Mclemore is. Boris Diaw is. Andrew Bogut is. Mozgov is. Gallo might be. Tony Allen is. Who's that guy on the Bucks? Y'know, not Giannis, not the other guy? He's better than Rose too.   [10+ shots on 42% or worse](http://stats.nba.com/league/player/#!/?CF=FGA*G*10%7CFG_PCT*LE*42&amp;Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;sort=FG_PCT&amp;dir=1), Gotcher Jamal Crawfords, your Nick Youngs, your Kemba Walkers, Dion Waiters-es, MCW's, Vander Blues... This is a bad list to be on, unless you're A) shooting a lot of threes at a good rate, or B) doing the other stuff well.   Guess what? Rose isn't a good three point shooter, and he wasn't a good playmaker last year either. 5 assists - 3.2 TOs. He also doesn't draw FTs.   Derrick Rose, at least the one we've seen recently, is worse than almost every starting PG in the league, because he shoots like crap and he shoots a lot. He's not a good defender anymore, and he doesn't rebound well. He DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WELL NOW.
