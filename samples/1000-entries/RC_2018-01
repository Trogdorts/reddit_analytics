We agree and that's why we work with SuperRatings at https://pecuniaresearch.com/ - it still fascinates me that people are so fixated on fees - yes they are important but i've yet to have been convinced why people don't solely focus on net returns - returns presented on Pecunia are calculated net of investment fees, tax and implicit asset-based administration fees although explicit fees such as fixed dollar administration fees, exit fees, contribution fees and switching fees are excluded.  Do people really want to try and work through the complexity of each and every single potential fee that one investment option charges relative next investment option?

I don't understand why Americans tolerate this shit. NFL is going to reward this team with the next best young player.  Stop rewarding mediocrity, in real sports like World Football, these kind of teams are relegated into bankruptcy.

I tested it out on Krita, Photoshop, and Paint 3D and all lines are smooth as always but it just doesn't feel like traditional pen lol. I must be confusing latency with something else as it doesn't really lag.  I did find the settings for the button but it still does nothing. I might just return it and try out an Intuos.   Another gripe I found is having to have my laptop flat to be able to use key shortcuts. If I put it into tablet mode, the keys are now behind, and in normal laptop mode the screen obviously moves with the pressure from my hand.  Edit: I should add that I really enjoy being able to draw directly onto what I'm seeing and would prefer it over offscreen drawing

160...  Did sidequests, main story, a lot of turned on doing merc mission while doing literally anything else, crab farming in Mor Ardain for like 2 days, Zenobia's hit list and other time consuming affinity trees...  In the end I still faced the final boss at a reasonable level ([71](/s)) and died once. Could've been two but Morag dodged his big ult, that 18 seconds 100% dodge on her water katana blade is just silly  Edit: I also lost probably most of my play time just exploring every zone trying to find everything, including Temperantia where I had to ninja my way in most places. Even got to defrost ice cube man, that was a fun run for my life moment

Could've been two but Morag dodged his big ult, that 18 seconds 100% dodge on her water katana blade is just silly  Edit: I also lost probably most of my play time just exploring every zone trying to find everything, including Temperantia where I had to ninja my way in most places. Even got to defrost ice cube man, that was a fun run for my life moment

1: that's fairly normal. The foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. Over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. If it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. But in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. It might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so I wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. If it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, I don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. I hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  I know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  Cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, I really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. But here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/penis-health/Pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. And it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. But, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. I wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. It isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. Your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.  But every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.  5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. Your reaction is up to you.  Most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. Yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. So doing it quick and only short glances is best. But curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  It isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  But eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. It's one of those things you get used to. When you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. Nobody really does tbh.

So doing it quick and only short glances is best. But curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  It isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).  But eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. It's one of those things you get used to. When you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. Nobody really does tbh.
1: that's fairly normal. The foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. Over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. If it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. But in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. It might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so I wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.  2: it is supposed to be sensitive. If it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, I don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. I hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  I know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.  Cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, I really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. But here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/penis-health/Pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)  3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. And it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. But, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. I wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. It isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.  4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. Your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.

I don't even like Trump or his policies, to be clear. But I also judge him by his actions, and so far this action (terminating a gentleman's agreement that never existed and was never enforceable in the first place) is largely a lateral move that doesn't change the present state of things either way.

You should really try to grab at least 100k to stake, and then "split" into probably 10 different UTXO's.   Check out this getting started video if that isn't very clear to you https://youtu.be/0ufrBwNDWts

"Back to you guys in San Diego"  :(  As much as it hurts, I still love hearing it because eventually no one will say the words "San Diego Chargers" anymore, and that's what's really sad.

So, in the same breath, you are saying:  A) These types of public displays on government buildings are **not** endorsements of the religion.  B) Of course Israel doesn't have other displays from Islam or Hinduism on it's government buildings, it's a Jewish state.  So in B, you seem to be implying that it would be inappropriate for the Jewish state to have displays on public buildings from religions that it does not endorse. I find this hard to reconcile with point A.  Now, I don't have a problem with Israeli government buildings displaying Jewish displays on it's building, since they have a different laws and founding principles. I only have a problem with *not* calling this displays as they are: endorsements.   If there are US government buildings with overt religious displays of a singular religion, I do have a problem with this on first amendment grounds and the US government is sued on a regular basis over this.

I would imagine that droid planet as a hellish dystopia where your net worth includes the parts keeping you functioning, and the richest droids buy and sell poorer droids treating them more like slaves than objects. Essentially replicating either ancient or colonial American systems of slavery. Self contained power struggles, rebellions, and various conflicts.

Having the unstable political truce might allow for some gradual improvements for elves (something sorely needed), and keep both Celene and Gaspard in check as they realize how much they need the Inquisition to keep the peace.  My Treveylan almost went that route, but couldn't find a way to keep Celene in line, and ended up with Briala ruling through Gaspard, because it would limit the expansionism and the Game.  She feels guilty as hell afterward, but still thinks it was the best choice for the Inquisition.

My favorite thing about that opening level was you get to the boss fight, and no matter what you do, he completely kicks your ass. Then Zero swoops in, saves the day, and DIES saving you! That was some really heavy shit for young me. Up to that point I don't think I'd ever encountered such a mature scene in a video game.

How is life where itâ€™s so black and white? It must be easy to exist in a world so clear. Not a world where teenagers experiment with drugs and sex and alcohol and emotions. A world where when you get to college you just study and sleep. Same as you did in high school.   I love having to explain things to people. Is it so far over your head to see that this shit happens whether youâ€™re watching or not? And that no amount of parents freaking out will change it or has ever changed it over the course of history?  She tried coke with a guy she liked. Big deal. Coke, weed, and alcohol are all the same level of drug.   If she did heroine or something then yeah be upset. But a little coke? Thatâ€™s life and itâ€™s Happening all over the globe right now ( especially with it being New Years) whether you want to be ignorant to it or not.
