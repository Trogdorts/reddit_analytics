I think a nice dry aged steak would be awesome. Maybe take him to a farmers market or farm and let him choose what he would like to have? A lot of times they have some really cool and unusual stuff. Also, it supports local business! A new Japanese chef knife would be so cool too. Shun is a very good brand. Hope this helps!

Ye, that's what it kind of looked like. Even though you may or may not think about this mid-game, about pushing up and staying a little longer than you should, it's interesting to look at it post-game to see what might be a better play. Obviously I don't have access to the replay, but maybe it would've resulted int a better post-plant retake. Who knows! I personally love analyzing gameplay to see what could've been done better.

do believe this is pulling back the wizard's curtain; 90 minutes of nonstop onslaught of heckling and chaos is not the same as a 3minute clip on the news ... I didn't want the first one, knowing how it would be; prob don't have the stamina to go thru another.  And poor Chris Wallace, does not deserve the snark sent his way.

Also a European I would find the opposite claim a bit hilarious; the almost exclusively online claim that the American Democratic Party is a centre-right party. All political parties are moulded by their political environment, and the US as a whole is undeniably to the right of Western Europe, as such the Democrats would be to the right of UK's Labour or Germany's SPD, but still to the left of the UK's LibDem's or Germany's FDP. The political spectrum/compass is already deeply flawed, and falls apart even more so comparing political parties on different continents

This is a power play.  *You're not breaking up w/ me. I'm breaking up with you.*   If they're going to pretend to be "official" and flex in legalese with these sorts of communication perhaps the INC should provide a document that explicitly lists expectations from members. Instead they use cherry picked verses out of context and contort that into something that supports their case. What happens is that anything that the INC feels is a threat to their agenda is quickly thrown into the "not-uniting with the church administration" or "sowing division" buckets with very broad interpretations.  BTW: Nice to see my offering getting wasted on certified postage. \*golf clap\*

I'm going to point out that Harry follows Hermione to the classroom she's crying in, says something about how pretty the birds are, and that's that. We know his intent, but he didn't actually manage to do any comforting. Him comforting Hermione was more clear in the movies. He just stood around in the books.  And it's one thing to sometimes neglect your friends, and it's completely another to go around 7 years of friendship, have said friend almost die for you several times, and STILL not manage to reciprocate that care at least 10 times.  Harry's a peculiar guy. He will die for you, but he can't quite manage to give you a hug when you need it. I'm not saying he is the worst friend on earth who is only using Hermione to keep him alive (although I understand where you might have gotten that impression). I'm saying that he doesn't show his love in ways that are easily visible or recognizable. I'm saying that Harry is preoccupied with a lot things (not his fault of course) and so used to having Hermione there that he forgets she's not invincible or immortal. I'm saying I wished he showed his appreciation more and reciprocated that devotion too.  As for that line, you're right, it is logical and fair. It is also MEAN, and the only thing that stopped him from saying anything was because he needed Hermione well for the mission. It wasn't out of some regard for her well-being. Her well-being WASN'T even a consideration at all, and that's what I find reprehensible. It doesn't make him a bad person, but it does make me question his regard for Hermione. And it makes my skin crawl how utilitarian he is being in this case.  You're right of course - such thoughts aren't unreasonable. But it highlights how much Harry takes Hermione for granted. It shows how much he considers the things she does par for course.   I'm going to admit my bias in that reciprocity in friendship is one of the things I value a lot, and that's probably coloring my reaction. Harry not giving back or even acknowledging what Hermione has sacrificed for him nettles me in ways that are visceral and not entirely rational.
Just in time for another memorable Halloween party too.
When writing recursive functions one of the first things you should think about is how you are going to make the recursion stop, i.e. what are your base cases? This is analogous to thinking about your exit conditions in a loop.  In this example your base case is the same as your for loops stopping point, you want to exit when some counter, k, is greater than or equal to j.  Each recursive call will need to modify the k variable in a similar way as the for loop is modifying it with each iteration, k++.  You also need to think about what you want to do when you actually hit your base case, in this instance you want to return the max value.  some pseudo code to get you started:   public int getMax(int[] A, int i, int j, int k, int max){ // note the changes to the function signature    // base cases    //  if k &gt; j, return max; -- found the max, return it    //  else    // find max so far: if (A[k] &gt; max) max = A[k];    // recurse by calling getMax with the next k value and the new max, and returning the result of that recursive call    // return getMax(...)  }  I assume this is a homework problem, if you're allowed to change the variable names it would be nice to change i to "start" and j to "end" and k to "i" since i is traditionally used for the current index, and would make reading the code a bit more clear.  Recursion can be hard to grasp at first, try working through the code step by step, literally writing down the variable values for each function call and what they will return. You'll notice that one function is kindof "paused" when it calls itself and you have a new set of variables to work through. Once you finally "bottom out" and hit the base case that doesn't recurse, all your function calls will start "rubberbanding" back their return values upwards until the original function call itself returns.

I got it from the official Celtics Pro Shop (in TD Garden), so it has the GE logo on it too.

I'm pretty sure they are? but it's not mentioned from what I can find in the notes or anything.
I mean, those will work, they just might not be the stiffest option. You can always replace them afterwards if it's too floppy.  You could make a decent rig with 2x2s, but it would require a lot of them, and some triangulation. Good luck with whatever you build though!

Maybe because there isn't a whole lot of 4K content unless you're buying or renting in 4K. Streaming wise the movie selection isn't all that good, especially if you're looking for something that isn't a Netflix or Amazon Original.

What natural disaster did he blame Trump for, out of curiosity?  I heard him assign blame to Trump for the recession and high number of preventable deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, which was honestly pretty reasonable. He's not responsible for all deaths or all jobs lost, but certainly quite a large proportion.

&gt; I honestly don't know anybody that actually "loves" their private insurance. The idea of a choice is bullshit.  Part of it is the last point about people imagining the worst case scenario. A related but slightly different phenomenon is "people disliking uncertainty"-they may not like their current health care, but if they have it, they at least know that they have it; they don't know what a new system would look like, so it's scary. You can explain all you want, but until it's a tangible, existing thing, they'll be scared and hate it. It's also why the "Medicare for All" polls better than just general "Universal Healthcare", because it ties it to an existing thing that people know about. It's also why approval for the ACA went up after it had been a thing for a few years.

I wanna give the HC of the team I root for a lot of props, but let's be fair. Doug showed in 2018 and - somewhat - in 2019 that he was a solid HC working with what he had. However, I would say maybe Reich - or John DeFilippo, or a combo of both - had a huge influence on the offense/Wentz's development that season, and without them he wasn't able to keep up the growth he made
isn't that not Biden's plan though, just based off the fact that it was the biggest thing he was attacked for in the primaries, not supporting MFA? and the fact that he said last night that he didn't support that?   seems like [Biden's plan](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/#) is more about keeping all the parts of ACA that people like (coverage for pre-existing conditions, keeping kids on parent's insurance until 26, etc) and building off of that. Biden's definitely too centrist to be dabbling in MFA.
More people need to think about this moment when considering that trade.

I was working for an ass of a manager once that scheduled me to work on what would otherwise be a day off because I didn't have kids and he was letting someone else have the day with their family because that was more important to me as for ME it was "just another day" because "you are just a kid and you don't even have a family so you don't realize how important family is!"  He did this the week before Christmas. I pointed out to him that my mother was terminally ill and had checked herself out of the hospital to spend her last Christmas with us and I WAS going to be there. The bastard looked at me and said, "She will not be alive to remember it....Susan's children WILL!" I told him to go fuck himself and quit on the spot.   A couple of hours later the other manager called me and asked me what happened and I told him. He tried to get me to come back because they were short handed. I told him nope. Word got around about why I quit (It wasn't like me telling him to go fuck himself went unnoticed at the time) and around the middle of March THEIR boss called me. I told her what happened. She offered me my job back. I declined. They were both fired. I'm sure there were other factors.....but at least they had to deal with some crap.
I see the face of regret on that smasher

my neurologist recommended that i go on disability after my hypoxic brain injury which resulted from a cardiac arrest. I was like 'bitch, I drove here and I work full time in public accounting. I am not disabled.'   all this to say... based on how readily she made that suggestion, I don't doubt that it would be reasonably easy to get on disability. even better if your injury resulted from your company's negligence.

1. I'm ambivalent. Tbh, I've been ambivalent about the ownership both pre and post WalMart. I have a lot of friends and family in the Pittsburgh area, which was one of the places where ModCloth is based, and there was a big trend of hiring young grads then mass layoffs. I don't love that in a company.  2. I love the old Modcloth aesthetic. I feel like in the past couple years its lost its vision of what it is or who its customer is. I'm having flashbacks to the awkward 80s officewear that was in all the ads a season or two ago. \*shudders\* But my older Modcloth clothes were all decent quality, with pockets in dresses, and the fit and flare dress aesthetic is very flattering on my body type. I still have quite a few ModCloth pieces, even after changing sizes since my ModCloth heyday, and they are still some of my favorite items that I own. 3. I hope so. But to survive, they're going to have to take a hard look at who their target customer is, and build a vision for themselves as a brand that fits that. And they should be better to their employees, because if you want to build a quirky and fun brand, you want to have all the institutional knowledge you can get to help your business grow. 4. ModCloth in its early days was so good at appealing to quirky but classy customers. People who wanted clothes that were good quality, had a unique aesthetic, had pockets, and were size-inclusive. I think that if ModCloth could embrace the "quirky but high quality" niche that it would grow and retain loyal customers. Brands lose customers when they hit that point where the quality goes downhill but the prices stay the same. And it would be even better if there would also be a focus on ethical and sustainable clothing that still fits the ModCloth vibe, kind of like Madewell but make it vintage.
Honestly hope it’s before Tanaka pitches. Disaster scenario is a rainout meaning he pitches one or two innings this series.
My pop was an Australian japanese POW and he sat me down when i was young and told me dome really horrible things.

Well thank you, I didn’t know about the plastic becoming brittle due to thread locker! You probably saved me from wasting many parts I’m planning to replace. Does it apply to every material?   Good point about purple loctite, I’ll keep that in mind also.
Well the book is basically the real story ^^  But Nay, Sauro had huge armies and was barely ramping up. Denethor only saw that fact. In the books it's implied that Sauro knew Denethor saw his territory and thus showed off even more his troops.

Yes. How you look when dating will impact your chances of success.   When you dress to go meet someone, or to go out, what you wear, is the FIRST thing you will be judged on.  Does this mean wear a 3-piece to the club? No. Well, if you're a hunter or butcher from the 1800s you would, and a smoker's jacket, red, silk.   No, if I go to a club and I'm chilling out in my in-home only Frumpy gear, I would be rightfully shamed. But if I go in a crochet salami sock and a black bow tie, people are gonna know, I made the effort to fit into the crowd where we are.   Would Marianne have shagged a Juggalo? God I hope not, but what about some small-town guy cleaned up, drinking an old fashioned?   Make sure your clothes fit. Go to a department store and talk to the sales people. Pay attention to them. Coordinate your outfit. You'll look great!
Looks like a cutscene in a game
&gt; how to handle a squatter?  The problem with phrasing it this way is that it is not accurate. A squatter is someone who occupies a space that they do not have the right to occupy.  People who register domains and do not do something that you want them to do with it are not squatters. People who think their domains have a higher cost than you think they have are not squatters.  There isn't much to do about it because what they are doing is not a problem. As someone else suggested, the best thing to do is to get another domain.

I totally get that. As a highly awkward person myself, I know how great it feels to muster up the courage to go out of your way to help other people. Stay awesome!
Doesnt matter if youre figthing 4 of those..
Awesome video! I really enjoyed it keep up the great work. I’ve liked , and commented to give you my support! If you get a chance, it would be great if you could check out my Speedpaint video I think u would like it- I would greatly appreciate the support  https://youtu.be/nzEmHJPuY_g
Well, those Trump supporters are wrong and they should inform themselves because they're actively harming people. If she's so kind to immigrants who don't speak English, she's a hypocrite for supporting the guy responsible for putting kids in cages and sterilizing immigrant women with hysterectomies.   If your social circle keeps shrinking to the point it only includes toxic people, that is a sign that you're toxic people as well.
I super-duper hope at least her mother turns out to be Pakistani, because that surname is Italian and if they hired an Italian to be Marvel's first Pakistani hero, She'll get it from both sides.  Her first name gives me hope.
Or when you’re dead, your consciousness also goes away, so you will never know!

Wow! So creepy!  This is a literal bombshell showing Trump with clearly a disease requiring a brain implant, or a mic attempting to feed him information during debates.  But let's be real, it's not that second one because he is a literal moron during debates. Maybe it's just bugged?
Oh jeez, apologies. I’d like to rewind - I promise I’m not as ignorant as I seemed. I’m honestly so baffled at the ridiculousness that I made the mistake of trying to make any sort of sense of it.   I was wondering how “stand down” could be taken as the sort of preemptive rallying cry that the PB&amp;J are taking it as. Then I made the mistake of going on twitter, and stand down has become stand back/stand strong/stand ready/stand stand(??).  Well, at least 2020 will go out with a bang? Basement dwelling pseudo militia vs...the stairs to the first floor?
I uploaded a fanart, I suspect on the same day he filmed lwiay. So it got 24k upvotes, but it was still growing when he looked at the reddit. Just missed it. :( oh well, there's always next time. I'm still excited so many people upvoted my fanart.

At the end of the day you have no one to blame but yourself. You can sit and cry all day that a company laid you off, but it won’t bring your job back. My entire post is about creating a new mindset, you are in charge of your life (well not you obviously) but people are in charge of their life. Accountability, confidence, constantly learning new skills, and a positive mindset will make you bullet proof. Try it sometime, it might make you realize how weak you look by trolling on comments creating no value to the conversation.

Okay, thanks for the link! Same idea, but my guess was wrong. I didn’t know that there was a screen mirroring app for the SteelSeries keyboards.   Also, the Apex Pro and 7 look identical, but the switches are different, which isn’t visible in the OP. No way for me to know which OP had until he clarified.

What I hate the most is when they combine all 50 states into one. Like when people make arguments about the US they look at law from like one state that says they allow the death penalty and then say "OMG THE US DOES THE DEATH PENALTY WHAT A FAILURE OF A COUNTRY" or some shit when not every state does that.
The fact you think the program has cost 1.5 trillion so far shows you have zero idea of what you're talking about, as if the "decapitating pilots" BS didn't already give it away.

省去点链接的免费，此为原文   年轻人很苦，非常苦，不仅仅是物质上的，还有精神上的。生活中的快乐太少，好的作品太少，只能往前找，甚至要自己制作，才能有点乐子  现在的很多文艺作品都是资本家做出来的屎，你只能在A屎或者B屎中选择，就像这样。我不明白，上海人民做错了什么？要被这样折磨？  而官方呢，又是与屎共舞，为屎作伥  基本上当代的年轻人已经无法从宏大叙事中获得任何参与感。说人话就是，主流叙事已经抛弃年轻人很久了。所以越来越多的肉食者开始发觉，根本搞不懂年轻人在想什么。为什么上一代惯用的宣传策略，官方的文化产品，这一代人根本不买账，然后搞出一堆宣传事故  因为他们不把所有人当人，只把一部分当人。就像是B站宣传的“后浪”，有能力像后浪一样生活的年轻人万中无一，去被拿来代表年轻一代 从那个五四宣传片里看起来，随着时代发展，国家进步，当代青年都过上了想吃就吃，想喝就喝，想玩就玩，有梦就追的理想生活，可以自由的玩单反，开跑车，高空跳伞，花式潜泳，在欧洲旅游拍vlog……  我第一次看还以为他妈的美国才是发展中国家，伟大复兴早就实现了……  然而现实是什么，举一个行业的例子，《2018年外卖骑手生活报告》显示：中国700万外卖小哥，硕士及以上学历占1%，也就是说有7万硕士在送外卖；本科占3%，也就是21万，合计本科以上学历28万人。  而这个行业的现状是，仅在上海一个城市，平均2.5天就有1名外卖小哥伤亡！ 这他么现实这么沉重，谁能浪的动？  七万人经过二十年的系统化教育，然后出来跑腿送菜，本质就是产业升级失败，没有产生更多的高端岗位，导致大家都在低质量的发展状态中恶心循环，然后官宣动不动装傻白甜，问年轻人为什么不努力，为什么这么佛系 我呸，这还不够努力么，您能给条活路么？ 大肆宣传无私奉献，却对996视而不见；歌颂资本家创新敛财，对劳动者保护只字不提；用到你的时候说是年轻人多，都是人口红利；用不到的时候说“不想996就滚，外面有的是人愿意干”…… OK，fine 既然没有共识，那就分道扬镳  你宣你的龙之梦，我玩我的圈地自萌   经历过和主流叙事同频共振的那一代人无法理解——年轻人为什么不积极响应组织号召， 斗志昂扬，而去玩这些看起来毫无意义的事情，并且痴迷其中？  如今大型资本基本把持了各个行业，年轻人要么去当干电池，等榨干被扔出去，要么直接躺平。也没有任何能力去响应主流叙事，去理解那些所谓的“伟大事业需要一百年”  年轻人也无法正常的表达，要是去讨论一些严肃的，重要的事情，比如怎么创造一个更好的社会，就会有各种各样的压力，让你闭嘴。你知道我说的是什么。中文互联网过去像养蛊一样养了二十年，最大的危害并不是杠精，或是低质量的辩论，而是所有人都在陆续沉默。新的，反应社会现实冲突的作品越来越少，几乎绝迹。 年轻人无法对群体的生活发表看法，而表达又是所有人的天性   年轻人不能上桌参与讨论正经事，那就只能去找点不正经的，不然要被憋疯了  所以为数不多能做的表达渠道，就是解构，解构一切。用荒诞表达严肃，用虚假演绎真实，用顺从表达反抗。毕竟绝对的顺从，就是绝对的反抗。 这也是中文互联网的奇观，大家像是被关的太久的猴一样，没有新的玩具，就把之前的东西拆开重组，构成新的欢乐源泉  年轻人变成了边缘人群，就会产生主流看不懂的边缘文化  “很有精神”“黑人抬棺””安敢在此饶舌“都是这种场景下应运而生，如果追问下去，会有一百个同类问题 现在去打开B站的鬼畜区，大家已经开始重新解读奥特曼了，包括但不限于  ”奥特曼为什么抑郁，人类还有希望么？“  ”【伏地魔X林黛玉】伏黛CP向 第三年的见异思迁“  ”诸葛亮和王司徒的经典传唱“  ”B站鬼畜宝藏歌手雷军“  ………………  没有好的文艺作品，我们就自己创造。没有好的创作环境，我们就去以往的作品中回顾  你会看到那些或是古老，或是经典，或是不知道从哪蹦出来的热梗，像烟火一样，让年轻人获得瞬间的快乐，然后迅速的消失。观众们都在哈哈大笑，却不知道笑什么 拆解，再重组，就是一切 伟大事物需要一百年，却没人短暂的关心我们一下 这是年轻人为数不多的快乐，虽然也会像黑人抬棺一样慢慢淡出人们的视线，  马上就会有新的，更神奇的空耳，更荒诞的组合，更好玩的热梗传递到社会上 单纯理解一个梗的流行没什么意义，甚至创作他的人也说不出为什么火，就是好笑。这一类创作的本质是一个无聊的年轻人，在翻阅以往的文艺作品中，发现了一个好笑的点，加工出来，被一群压抑的年轻人发现其中的荒谬和快乐，继而引发的群体狂欢  现实中越是充实的人，就越无法理解其中的快乐 像上一代人一样，享受工作的成就感，获得感，恋爱的快乐，家庭的快乐，代价都愈发高昂，所以未来这种低成本的娱乐方式，会吸引越来越多的年轻人。  这才是真实的后浪：面临着高房价，面临着巨大的生活压力，面临着消费主义的侵蚀，面临着失业的痛苦，却像等待戈多的塞缪尔·贝克特一样，创造自己的荒诞派戏剧，自己娱乐自己，我觉得很了不起 很有精神！ 日本年轻人如果有的选，没人愿意当平成废物，费尽心机从远古作品中挖掘快乐，现充它不香么？  未来还会有更多大家看不懂的热梗出现，荒谬是大家共同选择的色调 把蛋糕吃完又舔盘子，还要求没吃到的人继续做，天下没有这么好的事，先生们。 张华考上了北京大学生物系，李萍进了华为写程序，我在基层当公务员，我们都有光明的前途

Gavin McInnes wanted a club to express his deep-seated homosexual urges without his wife finding out.   It slowly transitioned to something similar to a gang because they clashed with Antifa a lot after Trump won in 2016. The initial belief system were things like pro-Western chauvinism, "venerating the housewife" and pro-entrepreneurship generally.   Yes, that is all true.

Do yourself a favor, especially in light of what will be different this year, and get it before the 2nd week in November. The whole industry is trying to get away from Black Friday so they will incentivize shopping earlier this year. I've heard that deals will start as soon as next month.

Hey sorry I know you posted this a while ago so I'm kinda of late, but if you want a kinda similar name you could go by Ari? I think that name is dope. I also really like Aaron.  You also kinda look like an Oakley to me? Idk it doesn't sound that similar to Arzyn but I just personally really like it as a name and feel like it might suit you.  Edit: Langston? Or Rhys (pronouced "Reese" I think). Ian? Bryce?

It was the religious zealots and extremists who demanded the separation in the first place. They supposed that without an official religion there would be no reaso to persecute them for their backwards and dangerous beliefs.
All this obsessing over case numbers and forecasts is neurotic and unimportant.   People should be focussing on how ridiculous our *current state* of restrictions are (including the 5km rule), especially given that NSW didn't have to do anything like this in a similar or worse situation. There is a good chance we're not going to make these arbitrary thresholds to move to the next level of arbitrary restrictions. We could be stuck in this state for a long, long time.
I am not sure how letting players control their own job history makes it a murder hobo breeding ground, but I have not had that experience.  Would you mind explaining how this occurred in your own game? Maybe there is some other difference.

Red delicious apples fucking suck. I honestly can’t understand how they ever gained popularity. They have a grainy texture, the skin gets stuck in your teeth, they are not sweet, not crisp, and their shape isn’t nearly as sexy. The fact that they literally have “delicious” in the name when they taste like cow ass is offensive and should be outlawed as false advertising.

&gt;I think that holding a belief simply in order to avoid ridicule is irrational  I'm not sure where you're getting that from what I wrote. Ridicule can cause people to reevaluate their belief, and may make them more open to considering other viewpoints. It's basic negative reinforcement, which is important in psychology.  It also works in reverse: when everyone around you is a racist, for example, you can rationalize it in order to fit in and come to actually believe it.

Oh wow, I didn't know about her line!! Do you know if it's any good out of curiosity? Seems like we get a lot of bailing from youtube once there's a line released? Which is weird, cause they're happy to sell to us for other brands while on it, but then it's crickets and on to instagram once it's time to shill theirs haha.  I'm not complaining because I do hate it when channels become self-promo vehicles only (like Linda Hallberg's which is now only about her own line and I got pretty over it), but ya know, would just love to continue having some of the old content too. I think Pony is the biggest exception since she not only keeps her channel as was but actually goes around breaking records for brand collabs (like at least 4 outta the top of my head this year - MAC, Colourpop, Morphe, Nudestix) when she has a line herself and shills for every brand under the sun (does she neglect hers as a result maybe btw? Because I never hear anything about Pony Effect tbh).  Cara was so great, holy crap, loved her looks to bits back in the day.
Very yes, it was my grandma that hooked me up with that shit.

So how would the business defend themselves against an unemployment claim? I've only been fired once and it was for being late to work 3 times. I filed for unemployment (knowing I wouldnt get it, because I was fired for cause, just to be petty and waste the managers/owners time). I would think if you couldnt come up with some kind of reasonable excuse that employee would end up getting unemployment

I can be completely wrong in my views and if so, please correct me, this is the my attempt at understanding politics. After 15 minutes of thinking, this is what I got:   Imho, I think the set of social norms that fall under the term "human rights" could - theoretically - thrive on moral decency among individual people alone. But since everyone's morality differs so widely, it seems logical to have them written down concretely. However, history has shown us time and time again that this is not enough to reach the point where these rules are followed unconditionally: these right - rules by now - evidently need to be supported.   How? For example, through the intervention of a governing factor. Like a political party or department capable of organizing law enforcement (that is actually functional - US police, I'm looking at you) . Now we've reached a point that's not so different from politics. Point and case: I think that while human rights are fundamentally a moral question, in our society, it is much more frequently brought up as a set of rules associated with political actions.

Self love. I took five years (2014-2019) and didn’t date after a major heartbreak. I was celibate for three years. I thought needed to understand what I did wrong to make him not love me after I invested years into the relationship. Turns out he didn’t do that to me. I did that to me by allowing the relationship to continue despite the fact of knowing he didn’t love me. I have nobody but myself to blame. I am now at a point in my life, having done the work to get here, where I won’t bend to fit into a box that isn’t made for me. I’m a f*cking unicorn. If a guy doesn’t see that eff him. You’ll find that there are a special few who will truly appreciate you once you truly appreciate yourself

look up trends for fall (like NYFW), things that are trending on depop, on explore page. vintage levi’s are always good, sweaters. i suggest going through top sellers or your fave sellers and picking what type of style you’d like to sell. i sell things that are my style but that i don’t need, it helps sourcing a lot

Trump failed to condemn white supremacists when given five straight minutes to do so, and indeed told them to "stand by". Go tell some black people that there's no difference and see how well that goes for you.

If you find it you will notice the difference really quickly, anything with eight legs has their legs turn black as they die. We use it at our ranch so we don’t have to worry about spiders and scorpions in some of the old buildings as well as our house. It’s some strong stuff though, I would use a pump bottle at low pressure so it doesn’t get in the air too much. It doesn’t really hurt or make you sick it just makes people sneeze when it dries.

Yes I’ve read worm, I just don’t concentrate on asking myself why people what powers. The process is more interesting that’s all. Ex: did you ever stop to think if Riley added more nerves to Bryan? Or if taste buds were located under something that was pulsating and drip dropping or bouncing like a bon-jee cord or if she could have engineered mechanical bugs to stimulate more pain? Honestly it’s those kind of questions that are interesting.

Rebels can beat empire on offense, same with a well rounded empire if your bomber is starred.  Resistance is surprisingly good against all the lesser fleets so long as they don’t have bistan/y wing for rebels or the tie bomber for empire. I genuinely can’t get the finaliser fleet to do anything well. If you lose kylo (which you will) it’s game over.
I never deleted my comment, and I'm not full of shit. Googling the quote I wrote brings up plenty of reliable sources, but like most libtards, doing your own research must just be too difficult.

Just look at Doc Ock in the scene. Sure he is older, but his features make him look real. New Peter looks like an Android. Plus, he’s a little too pretty imo. Peter was a lady killer, but not a model, and he is usually disheveled from changing all the time. Some messy hair and baggy eyes would help a lot.

Good question, and I think many others can probably relate to this.  I think the primitive parts of the brain are really good at trying to maintain the habit, and thoughts that say "one last time," or "it's not a big deal anyway," or "there's really no need to quit right now" are very common. I think that just learning to recognize those binge-encouraging thoughts that are leading you to give in to the urges is very important.  The more awareness you can develop about the urges, the better, because then they can't catch you off guard.  I think you know that you want to recover and why you want to recover, but it's important to accept that there are going to be times when your lower brain tries to convince you that you don't actually want to quit.  If you can dismiss those apathetic thoughts, and avoid the binge, those tempting times will get less and less until they are gone completely.

Irishtown Nature Park has some lovely trails (especially this time of year) that are flat. A 4km loop in the park is undergoing some construction currently, but you can still access some sections. The waterfront trail is also flat, and a mix of crushed gravel (the Dieppe and Riverview sections) and paved (Moncton section). You can access it from most anywhere along Main Street, but especially parking by Chateau Moncton it's easy to pick up. Mapleton Park is pretty flat too, and I think about a 5km loop; you can access it from the main parking lot off Gorge Road.

Let me explain to you what grooming exactly is:  First they kidnap you. You might get into their car in one way or another, maybe they just asked you for a favor and you got alone with them. The point is you got alone with them. Then they have sex with you. Forcefully of course, but you being a little 14yo girl barely comprehened it. Then they tell you: if you dont come tomorrow at place X and keep your motuh shut we are gonna tell your parents what you just did. So you comply. Then they rape you again. This time they threaten they will also rape your parents if you stop coming. At this point the child doenst know what else to do but comply. To solidify the dependency they usually start introducing drugs in the relationship. This is where they start selling you to people. This is where you have been deemed groomed. You are totally not telling yourparents anything and you are most likely addicted. Do you understand what groomed is now or do you still deny this horrific crime inflicted on thousands of children in the UK?
I didn’t know about it until the debate and I am sure millions of other people didn’t either. It’s new news to me and since I haven’t heard it before I would bet it’s not even a couple of months old. That isn’t old news.

I also suggest an app called I'm Sober. It helped me break the addiction. And I know it hurts bro. But ya gotta push, even if you don't feel like it. Just for a little bit longer. You'll get there eventually, I promise.

I hope someday you will join us And the world will live as one.

I have a little bit of my monthly budget for useless crap. Sometimes I blow it on stuff like nice coffee or a video game. Usually I save it for buying hobby supplies.  ‘Course, $100 on pens sounds like an awful lot to me. I tend to go for buying cheaper/used pens so I can spend more on ink and paper. Also I typically buy one at a time.

1- Put the call on speaker and record with another device (friend's cellphone). 2- Get a cheap unlocked android 10 phone and record the call with an app (using the i-phone sim card) 3- buy a blue tooth phone recorder 4- if you have a headphone jack on your cell you can get a pair of recording headphones.  Also I'm not an i-phone user but check the app store I know that not all versions of android support phone call recording but I have idea what Apple's position is on the matter.

Ok, here's my take on the "Katara got too powerful too fast" arguement: She didn't. I would argue her bending and improvement are pretty on par with the rest I'd the gaang, save for toph and Zuko. Sokka learned fighting pretty quickly (one day with a master) and was also self taught like Katara. His progress from Book 1 to 3 is insane. He had pretty much no one to teach him as he was alone with katara and some younger kids for most of their childhood. Aang obviously is the avatar, so he's gonna learn rather quickly. He learns water bending much faster than Katara, earthbending much faster than Toph, and I think that's all pretty expected. But he learned firebending in a matter of minutes. So, Katara's growth seems to fit with that. Also, Katara didn't just learn to bend with Master Pakku, she knew how to bend freakishly well in the fight with him. She's learned by having a lot of fighting experience. Also, like Azula, Toph, and Aang, she's a bending prodigy. Idk, this all makes sense in my head, but it could come out completely idiotic. Would love to know your thoughts.

I agree it needs to be talked about, 100%. I look up to those who can post so publicly but posting on my social media is too much for me right now.

Thank you for the input, I appreciate it!
That's not what I said at all.  Where does pittsburgh steel get their ore. Through slave labor most likely.  Currently so many capitalist use slave labor of the natives to make a ptofit. Example bolivia.  I'm saying give it back to the natives. Organizing them into labor unions. Labor unions would include everyone.  The people who are already qualified for the jobs would be doing the jobs I hey we're already doing like  the janitorial  as well as the miners. Just because there is no corporate boss doesn't mean there's no one to do the jobs. I'll link a video that explains it all for you. It's not that simple to write it all out for you. But it's not hard to understand.  https://youtu.be/0RwlaNva_4g

&gt;Is there a break point in MSSQL?  Most versions of Management Studio have debugging built in. It was removed for a few releases but put back when a bunch of people asked for it.  &gt;How do you debug a big stored procedure?  I usually pull the code out of the proc and run it statement by statement myself. Or use good ol' [print debugging](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~fsieker/misc/debug/DEBUG.html).  &gt;How do you make sure that the stored procedure doesn't end up modifying the database?  I read the code and make sure I understand what it's doing. If I'm not 100% clear, I wrap code in a transaction and roll it back (but be aware that some things don't get rolled back with a transaction (identity column, sequence object), and other things don't participate in transactions at all (variables)).  &gt;How do you do this without using COMMIT?  See above.  The most important part of debugging though, if you're worried about changing the state of your database? **Don't debug in production.**

Will anyone with more know knowledge of him post a recommended match of his?
Curious as to how much of your relationship was in person versus how much was texting/messenging, etc.  I gather that he's long distance, so he likely views you as unavailable for that reason.  Texts and even phone calls do not convey the whole message when you're missing the expressions, reading between the lines, etc. It's way too easy to misinterpret and assume there is something there when there isn't...or possibly he just likes getting messages to stave off boredom.  So many people are addicted to their phones and do whatever it takes to keep the messages coming in. ...I have known some men with a virtual catalogue of women for this purpose.  I've had to block some of them to rid myself of their off and on neediness.  If the girlfriend is not giving him attention, he ramps it up with you.  Poor thing just needs someone to stroke his ego and give him some attention, most likely.
Throughout my time waiting for this game i've noticed that CDPR tends to promise a lot of things they can't commit to. I just don't understand why they even make promises in the first place, just seems like a recipe for problems.

One red flag - they're predicting a small gap behind your upper right canine. This will suck when eating, as food will get impacted there. They might be able to fix it with some refinements after the treatment should it actually occur.  The other problematic movement is 'into the bone' on the upper arch.   I don't see a lot of movement within the bone, which is one of the things that may cause gum issues. Make sure you're not damaging your gums with the trays - trim them down if they're pressing on them.

Steffon dreaded this moment he'd found himself in. For a moment, he considered telling him everything. *So he could debunk everything by lying? Who do you trust more, Orys or Byron?*  Steffon opened his mouth to say something, but decided against it. Still panting a little, he said, "Yes. Everything is fine." There was a hint of coldness in his voice. *"You're a Valyrian,"* he whispered. He didn't know if Orys heard that.
Tell me about it. And I have some degrees.   If I try it it backfires terribly: "You're idea that the primaries in the USA aren't rigged is nonsense, we have a long history of making policy decisions literally just to control who can and can't vote, I have a degree in Sociology." Makes people think: "Oh, you fresh-faced, flower-child, trying to brighten the world with your cosmic goodness..."  But if I say: "No, climate change, is extremely real and the biggest threat our species has ever faced and we can't solve it while keeping a Captialism-centric economic model. I have a masters in Computer Science." Its: "oh you're too far removed technically and can't think pragmatically."
Yeah, that's what I was weighing. With the question of when will cmc be back (and at what level) vs. Points right now from mixon. I am in 1st for the league so far so I hope I can wait out the injury. Thanks for the input, I'm going to go with no.

There are two fairly clear and intertwined narratives up until the stargate. Then it goes to shit. I'm sure a few people were able to figure out what was going on after that, but everyone I've ever met was just WTF??? Unless they read the book, which makes it quite clear.   Most people don't go to movies to be baffled by the ending. It's one thing for a director to make a plot ambiguous; it's quite another to make it nearly incomprehensible at the deneaumont. And I don't believe that is what he was going for, he just was too close to it.

Re: Spielberg doing musicals, you forgot the rather long musical/dance number in *1941*!
I actually have seen republicans not liking Trump and only siding with him because of single issue things, like abortion or borders (there are republicans who even would be in favor of public healthcare, but some democrats want to extend it to ilegals as well).  Also individuals can be racist, yes. But fascism is actually a collection of multiple different bad behaviors (racism included) and it needs a strong and big state to actually enforce it.  Besides, the biggest problem with politics is that people treat it like a sports team. "Gotta cheer for my team no matter what". if people didn't behave like that, then they would vote third party in mass. Because both Trump and Biden are complete garbage.
And here... we... go......
That hole between your legs is your vagina. Men penetrate it with their penis, pleasuring themselves as they thrust in and out of it, so much so that they ejaculate their semen into it. The semen then travels through your cervix at the end of your vagina, and enters into your uterus and reproductive system where it hopefully fertilizes an egg from your ovaries. Then you will grow a nice baby inside your fertile womb, only to push it out your vagina as part of the birthing process... Hence the wide hips.  Hope this helps 😊
Wow I am so sorry.  Poly vipers nests are sadly more common than we like to think.  Just draw from the support you can, keep as consistent as you can in your daily life.  Be open about your experience if people ask.

I understand, but I was just putting into context to the poster that blacks are a minority in the US, so even if there were perfect proportional representation, 12% is a low number.  &gt; As is I think there's probably less than a dozen or two in the whole AAPM, if you exclude immigrants from Nigeria and so on.  Not sure why immigrants should be excluded, but it's hard to know for sure. AAPM has only recently started to request demographic data

I love that concept, but the reality here is if she’s smart enough (doubt it, but she probably knows someone who is) she can have him arrested for felony property destruction, and then sue the piss out of him. I get that he paid for the floors, but if she owns the property it’s an open and shut case, the fact he posted this video doesn’t help.  Great concept in theory.. but not the best move in reality

 I tend to agree that the girls “why’s?” Are the why’s? that seem to lead people in circles and rarely advance the conversation. Why they did or didn’t leave goodbye messages, why they chose to ignore warnings about going off trail, taking a guide or even why they would have taken the night pictures (or not) won’t really solve anything. It’s not something we can ever really know or confirm. It’s all just rhetoric.   On the other hand It’s rather easy to speculate as to what a murderer, rapists or kidnappers motivations would be: Foul play— in a variety of imaginative yet somehow plausibly far fetched scenarios. But it’s impossible to know what the girls motivations were or what they were thinking given how little we know about them and what they TRULY experienced from the moment they began their hike. Add to that the well known yet oft ignored FACT that many people’s behavior changes drastically when their environment goes from safe to unsafe— known to unknown— and we have a solid recipe for not being able to predict with even vague certainty what the girls would have done when they began to feel something was off. How can we predict how someone would react if we don’t know what it is they’re reacting to?   While the descriptor of “sensible” is often applied to Dutch people as a whole- It’s definitely not how I’d describe two pretty young girls showing a lot of skin alone in Central America, without language skills or ANY previous experience traveling in developing nations without a group, parents or guides. That to me would be much more in line with those seeking adventure rather than safety and quantifiable or controlled outcomes. There are plenty of much safer places/options if you want to learn Spanish abroad and volunteer. Plenty. They could have gone to many an all inclusive program with guaranteed protection but they didn’t. They hooked up with some sketchy program that wasn’t even operational when they arrived.   I’d even go as far as to say that just the act of not taking a jacket or sweater on a hike into a RAINforest with varying elevations and weather systems is a straight up stupid choice for sensible and cautious people who apparently researched where they were going that day. I get them not having a knife or fire starter. They weren’t survivalists. But going up to a “cloud forest” half naked knowing the weather changes constantly is much more suggestive TO ME of people who were not paying attention to their surroundings than those who are cautious and mindful.  But even if we could figure out why they weren’t prepared for a hike would that get us any closer to knowing what happened to them? No. All it does is have us argue the definition of sensible and try and imagine what WE would do in their shoes.   No one wants to be disrespectful of these lovely girls. I certainly hope that’s not how I sound. Obviously just because they weren’t dressed sensibly doesn’t make their deaths their own fault. They weren’t “asking for it” or anything. They didn’t mean to get lost or injured or followed by some creep. To be clear- I do not think they are in any way responsible regardless of what it was that caused them to perish.   Whatever happened to them; their deaths were NOT their fault and people who don’t believe in foul play are NOT suggesting it is. No one is saying they brought this on themselves due to poor character. But personal accounts by friends and family regarding the girls is not actual evidence—it’s opinion and hearsay. And you can’t launch an investigation and base all following theories on such a shaky premise... besides, if the girls parents were so confident in their daughters abilities to remain sensible at all times why were they against the trip to Panama to begin with?  No one is doubting they were lovely young women. No one is saying they were stupid if they got turned around or lost. But being athletic and getting good grades is only evidence of scholastic achievement and fitness within a controlled environment. It says nothing about how “street smart” or worldly they were- or how they’d deal if faced with true adversity outside of their comfort zone. Not “I didn’t study hard enough for my test because my boyfriend dumped me” kind of adversity, but Real life and death adversity.  The kind of unimaginable “Trying to stay warm and take care of your hypothermic dying friend in pitch black while you’re hallucinating, soaking wet and your foot is crushed and trapped under a rock” kind of adversity. I might be able to imagine how I’d deal with such a dilemma, but never in a million years would I assume to know how someone else would. Especially someone I don’t know.   So again, being highly achieving academically with parents who thought they could do no wrong does not automatically translate to them knowing how to be smart in a totally foreign and potentially dangerous environment. Hadn’t one of them only been living away from her parents for a few weeks? Holland is one of the safest most civil places on earth. To assume they had bit off more than they could chew in the jungle is not a stretch- nor is it character assignation.   I’ve spent time in both places. Nothing about growing up in Holland would prepare them for the jungles of Panama. Either they were too naive to understand how vulnerable they were, ignored and brushed off warnings out of hubris, or they understood the danger and didn’t care or wanted to tempt fate. Please tell me how this is sensible.
You just triggered my doideka, jedi, and commando droid flashbacks. And yeah I see what you mean. Although there was the Utapau, Kashyyk, and Geonosis in 2014-15. Multiple decent Empire/First order/Rebel ones since then. We just keep getting these weird Clone And or Versus battle packs. Maybe because they dont want to make a droid one so they keep combining them?

You have to build new neural pathways when you learn any new skill. Not just in lifting, but in this case I'm talking about it so people can have a better understanding of their weaknesses.   To your other point, my trainer has a Bachelors Degree and is fully certified, so these aren't anecdotes from a random guy, they are the advice of a professional in their field of expertise.   At any rate, any claim that can't be backed up is a bad one so here:  https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/Fulltext/2003/04000/Training_Induced_Changes_in_Neural_Function.2.aspx  "Adaptive alterations can be induced in the neuromuscular system in response to specific types of training. Thus, increases in maximal contraction force and power as well as maximal rate of force development (RFD) will occur not only because of alterations in muscle morphology and architecture (2), but also as a result of changes in the nervous system (1,4,12)."  And another: https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/FullText/2010/11000/Neurophysiological_Responses_After_Short_Term.31.aspx  Harder to quote but feel free to give it a read, it focuses on maximal voluntary contraction.

Absolutely construction is where it's at. The hourly rate is roughly 50% more than legal surveying in Canada. It can be very stressful since you have to do it right, and it has to be right now in many cases. So maybe take some time doing other stuff that gets reviewed before submission to hone the craft, but once you have the confidence and skills construction is the way to go IMO.

Yeah, I get this feeling, too. I've never dated and never cared about sex so I basically have zero exp. My SO, meanwhile, has had several experiences with exes. I guess it's a me thing as well. I mean, it's all in the past and there's nothing I can do about it. What's important is that right now, she's with me and I hope she has fun doing things with me even if she's done them before.  Regarding talking about sex lives, whether it's her past or our current one, I'd feel weird hearing her talk about it with others. I view sex as a personal and private activity, so I don't see the need to tell others about it. Maybe you feel the same way.

I believe your two separate points point to the views of the pro-Yugoslav and anti-Yugoslav sides of the nation. On one hand you have pro Yugoslavs (usually Serbs) like Constantine who state that Yugoslavia is a necessity since a more divided nation would be picked off by larger nations such as Italy. Any “balkanisation” of Yugoslavia would result in Croatia, just as Albania was, turned into an Italian puppet state. After centuries of subjugation by neighbouring powers, this is not ideal.  Then you have anti Yugoslavs, such Croats and Montenegrins who are Yugoslavia as part of a Greater Serbia project, and just a vehicle for Serb annexation under the pretence of south Serb unity. However Due to historic and religious divisions, between Austria, the Ottoman Empire, Roman Catholicism, islam and orthodox Christianity etc, the ethnonationalism espoused by individuals such as Constantine simply don’t ring true. I guess this is exacerbated by things like the myth of Kosovo being such a powerful and pervasive national myth, but one that only really applies to the Serbs. Montenegrins largely retained independence, something they are very proud of with their warfare like culture which West describes whilst Croats became part of Austria.

I've been playing this season on Grim Scythe and it's got crazy damage. Can trash clear 150s. I play with slightly different jewellery though, for solo unity and CoE or flavour of time (I haven't decided which I like better yet. These are cubes items for me). In a group, drop unity and take both CoE and flavour of time. Krysbins and haunted visions are always there. If you want to push, ancient parthan defenders add defence. And in groups you might want to switch leorics for andarials visage for more damage if you have supports helping you stay alive. There's a lot more options for customisation in an LoD build, it can be fun trying out different things and figuring out what works best for you.
Much appreciated!

Sounds like yours may be a case where a prescription drug may be your only option then.  Just note that it would take much longer than 2 weeks for sulbutiamine and/or uridine to have an appreciable effect on upregulating dopamine receptors, but also that doing so wouldn't necessarily increase motivation.

I honestly think that's a good choice, if you aren't particularly interested in gaming. The only caveat is that it probably won't get many more updates, if any since it's already 2.5 years old. But, like I said, with a nice streaming box, the picture will be awesome.

if you are talking about last season we changed coaches recently. Florentino would have a difficult time to get game time initially, but he's clearly really talented. I don't think being that defensive is much of problem to JJ, it's mostly consistency. Florentino in characteristic is very similar to Fejsa or Javi Garcia for example who were absolute starters, specially Fejsa (who was one of the cornerstone of the team for a few years) while JJ was first at Benfica.  Florentino last season until January still started most games, but Weigl came in and was harder after that. I can see Florentino being able to start for us in the future

Hand sanitizer can be put into small spray bottles. I keep mine in a little plastic spray bottle that once held "glasses cleaner", fits perfectly in my pocket.   I suggest that everyone find a little spray bottle to carry sanitizer in. It's most likely harder to intimidate someone who has just sanitized your eyeballs, and usually it's harder to yell in someone's face when you can not really see that face.

Do you know how dilated you are?  I went in with contractions at irregular intervals and they found that I was 5cm already, and my water bag was bulging through my cervix. I was on mag for 24 hours and got both steroid shots. About 32 hours after the second steroid shot my water broke at 6cm and less than an hour later I was completely dilated. My son was born an hour after my water broke, at 31w5d. He's now 34w today in the NICU and doing well. He's off all support except his feeding tube and the warming isolette, but he's being weaned off the isolette and we're getting him practice breastfeeding. It'll still be a few weeks at least before he can come home.  Fingers crossed you can go home, but if not, it's okay. You'll be okay and your baby will be okay. At this point your baby will most likely not need intense interventions, which means they'll be watching for jaundice, lung function, etc. It's going to be scary, and you will need to lean on those closest to you. But you can get through this.  Let me know how it goes! Good luck!

Think about how your topic “Why do people still allow themselves to get sunburnt?” applies to the psychological processes that we’ve introduced throughout the course, and try to reframe it using these psychological processes. For example, do you believe that people don’t remember the evidence for sun damage? Is it a failure of attention? Information processing? When you frame it this way, it’s far more difficult to defend. Remember that you need to provide evidence for this claim! You’ve provided evidence that sunburns are bad. You haven’t provided evidence for people’s failure to reason effectively about sunburns.   You’ve also simply provided a list of topics that we discussed in the course without any explanation about whether or how they might apply to your topic specifically.  Finally, for your intervention, are you really planning to create bottles of tanning oil with scary photos on them and then sell them en masse in pharmacies across the country? Remember that you actually have to \*do\* this intervention and film your methods for your video. Make sure that it is something that’s going to be possible.
Comebacks like this don't come along often I'd want them again and again.
#Final Contingencies  **If Guy doesn’t split himself up and instead turns into a body horror nightmare:** While it brings its own challenges, mostly in unpredictability, it is easier to deal with than a swarm of minions. To begin, he’ll be limited to the mass of an average human for the first minute. This means that he’ll be at his weakest doing this within our first push. If anything hints toward this, we’ll simply focus more on disabling Guy with gasoline and an early version of the fire extinguisher bomb to make certain he won’t be able to try such plans for a while more. The rest of our strat can continue as normal.  **If one or both UE combatants are caught in a smoke cloud:** Whoever is in the cloud will equip a Palpimanus mask, mitigating the effects of being blinded. Guy and Arthur are only human, meaning that they will be less able to see than our duo- in essence, they’ve created a situation that’s actually advantageous for UE.   **If clothes or items get knighted:** ~~Insert Unfunny Nude Strat Joke~~ Either fighter can disrobe rather quickly. BoB, while imprecise, can rip Rob’s clothes right off him if it gets a good grasp on them. Medea’s 5 STR should allow her to tear them off with her bare hands or cut them away with her Kris; DSM can also participate if necessary.  Any items or equipment knighted will be flung out of range as quickly as possible, being dropped if necessary. BoB can also pressure or launch Arthur out of Madrigal’s 20m range.  **If Rob goes down:** Medea is a frightening fighter in her own right. She’ll adopt a more ‘hit and run’ style, equipping a cobra or ant mask on offensive runs towards Arthur or Guy. The aim is to get in, deal damage with the Kris and venomous bites, and get right back out. Her 4 AGI lets her outdo either of them on foot, and she can equip the Palpimanus Mask if she needs to maneuver vertically.  **If Medea goes down:** Rob will need to play a bit more carefully but is generally capable of maintaining distance and positively pelting the opponent with increasingly large objects in order to knock them out. If possible he will gather a fireworks cannon for increased range productivity. Once the opponents are worn down or discovered by the path of destruction, he can go all in, using the fire extinguisher as a bomb carried by BoB.  **If Guy’s head is hidden on the map somewhere:** If there’s one thing BoB is good at, it’s destroying things with AoE. And destroy it will- if Medea and Rob are still being harassed by VQ minions while Guy is nowhere to be found, especially if Arthur is down, Rob’s Stand will begin tearing apart the map. At A POW A SPD it can destroy most any part of the stage it can get its hands on in a matter of instants, applying its ability as it goes to superheat as much as it can. It will specifically aim for the bottom of towers or stage supports if given the chance, collapsing them into piles of rubble that it will then proceed to indiscriminately shred.  **If Arthur has Guy’s head with him:** Guy-specific tactics are applied to Arthur, specifically the spicy molten riot shield. This actually allows both fighters to focus their power on a single target, a net advantage for UE.  **If Arthur and Guy take center stage:** Medea and Rob will don spider masks, using the legs to climb up to the ceiling while leaving the humanoid stands unaffected. From above, the opponent will be showered in rocks and Debris, including a bowling ball and a fire extinguisher set to explode in a few seconds thanks to BoB’s timer.   **If Guy tries to restrain either fighter with VQ:** Medea should be able to break out with either pure strength or a nimble mask, such as that of a snake or wolverine. DSM and her kris are welcome additions to this tactic. BoB’s physical capabilities are of the same cloth, picking VQ pieces off of Rob with relative ease.  **If Arthur and Guy try to steal or break our masks:** We’ll just disengage and remake them, Rob providing cover through marble shots or physical attacks while Medea’s Stand does its thing. It’s a waste of time on their part given the speed of DSM.

Answer:  CDPR has called for employees to work more hours to finish up the game, of course this is generally called crunch. This is normal, even expected in the games industry sometimes, especially for big projects like CP 2077.  The reason there is so much traction is because some time last year higher ups claimed they wouldn't force anyone to work overtime for CP, but then have recently announced that they will anyway. In my opinion, this was inevitable, considering the unexpected pandemic, and the fact the CP is by far their most ambitious project to date.   This has generated much controversy, largely due to the misunderstanding of how labour laws differ from the USA compared to Poland (where CDPR are based). In the USA, overtime is not required to be paid by law, but is in Poland, for 50% extra on top of salary. In addition there are limits to the amount of overtime that is legally allowed, I don't remember the numbers from the top of my head, but they will be working 48hours per week rather than 40.   Im not sure how all of this works outside of Poland, as they have employees in other areas of the world, but that is the jist of the situation.  Edits:  *In certain cases, like hour by hour type contracts, overtime is payed in the USA but salary contracts aren't. I imagine most CDPR employee positions are salaried, but i could be wrong, but ultimately it doesn't matter anyway  **50% extra salary is for overtime hours only, not the entire year of work. This might not be so clear in my writing  Additionally, there is evidence of poor working conditions in CDPR, as some employees have come forward talking about the issue. It may not be as clear cut as im making it out to be.

It's not a personal attack if it's a criticism of your argumentation and logic.  If you accidentally arrive at a truth using the wrong methods, you're still messed up, because those wrong methods can lead you to *so many more falsehoods.* Anecdotal arguments form conclusions based on far too little data and far too much personal impression.  Post-hoc arguments form conclusions based merely on sequences rather than dissecting actual causes and effects.  This is both.
Absolutely! Whenever I finish making it.   I wanted to make the tip first, as it's the most challenging part.
Do you perhaps have any aunts or uncles, cousins, or grandparents who would be willing to help? Who would take you seriously?
Maybe if you're a tactical genius you realise that they're gonna get out of this one and it puts you in a better position to move first. But yeah kind of a stretch.
Please do not add any sort of flash or stun grenade as a tactical for this game. Those are one of the worst parts of other shooters. I still have bad memories from CoD: Blackout of stun grenades that completely ruin any chance of fighting back
Oh that was all me . Wallace is a career political analyst I am sure party affiliation is almost always about basic beliefs. As a partisan change in views is unlikely,  but many moderates regularly vacillate . Truthfully, Wallace is probably closer to a corporate oligarch than either party loyalist.
Haha fair enough.
No OP. thus Is even more reason to leave. If she is weaponizing your kids against you and has already cheated on you, shes gone too far as a decent person should. You should go to r/legaladvice and ask to see what your options are because if I remember correctly manipulating kids against another parent is illegal in most states. See what they say and weigh out your options. And as always keep all text, record audio(if it's legal in your state) and keep every receipt. It's the best defense you have.  Edit: as for your children SHOW then you love then. TELL them every day, every hr that you love them because the fact that your bothering to be dad despite what your ex is saying will go along way.
Thank you ! A nice discovery :D

&gt;Dancer as a combat discipline does not exist on the First.  Just because the Source's dancers draw from Thavnair's culture and tutelage doesn't mean that there isn't an equivalent on the First.  Pretty huge assumption for something that isn't actually stated anywhere.  Also you do realize that a) plenty of dragon models existed before HW and b) it's entirely possible that Hraesvelgr isn't a unique species of Dravanian, right?  Man you're doing a lot of talking out of your ass just to be pedantic.

Sorry I beg to differ. Cornelia Street is technically All Too Well 2.0 with the picturesque storytelling. She talks about being with Joe in NY and "rented a place on Cornelia Street" to spend time with him. Shortly sometime after, she interpreted that "you were leading me on" so she left Cornelia Street only to be caught surprised as Joe turned around and "showed your hand, walk me back to my apartment"  She's talking about how she knew Joe was the one for her and how she wishes that their relationship will last forever and that Cornelia Street will be their place held most important to them.  If he leaves the relationship, she will be crushed, hence "I'd never walk cornelia street again" because she does not want to reminisce on the hypothetical breakup.
Yep!
This is the fitting meme for this story

Nah, it's just a natural extension of the stupid "Biden has Dementia!" conspiracy theory that's also been making the rounds. She didn't allude to those incidents, she didn't say anything at all until after the conspiracy theories had also taken root in the discourse, and even then, only to call them ridiculous. The quote that was supposed to be from here was made up whole cloth.
They are authoritarian because they want to control speech. They are going after her because she says female biological sex is real. That's authoritarian.
&gt; Try to mention stadia in any of those discussions...the horror.  To be fair, Stadia is doing an exclusivity thing that few other companies ever tried (and some console does as a timed delay).

Whenever I see Apple users and Android users argue it always seems to be Android users bringing up facts and Apple users calling the Android users broke. Seems like Apple users think their products are better just because they are more expensive.   The way I see it is Apple keeps releasing products with very little changes from their last release and slapping a higher price tag on. Android has equal or even better products with hella durability but they get called trash for having reasonable prices.
Quite honestly I’m not sure how to evaluate Montoyo because it sounds like these are collaborative decision on the game plan, and he follows it to a tee.

&gt; And, I think because of this, the number of people that showed up and were willing to defend CivCorp was far fewer than most would have expected it to be.  I think it's more a combination of many more things than just "wealth became less relevant": - A lot of folks who were early civcorp supporters have just become less active in recent months - myself, topwolf, esorscher, albyrt, darkknight, posey, thoths, all substantially busier IRL and less active than before in the past 1-3 months. Lower activity weakens ties. - A lot of folks have perpetuated this "light on crime" attitude, which had people afraid of getting targeted by shit-stirrers in retaliation for "harsh" punishment - so they would appease the shit-stirrers and let them off light. This would perpetuate shit-stirrers snowballing on what they think they can stir up and get away with. It began with starting random wars (largely got away with it), then it became altraiding (yup, got away with that), then there was some sacking of towns after peace treaties (yup they got away with that too). Then it became obby bombing the neutral trade hub because...shitters dislike having their bullshit called out. - If 30 obbybombers can hit civcorp, what town should believe itself to be safe? People don't want to stand up and be the next target. - Finally, on civ, people are often unwilling to denounce their friends when their friends run off and pull some bullshit. Teenagers and college students, not yet having established themselves as independent adults capable of independent decision-making, are especially frequent adopters of this "friendship over principles/accountability" sort of mindset, and it so happens that many civ players are teenagers and college students. Many folks hesitated to react for this reason - they had friends involved in the obby bombing and thought "oh i can't turn on my friends...even when my "friends" go act like shitters without me".

Wouldn't call him a racist. I think he's just done with all the violence and riots that cause destruction and death and thus is angered by it, making him throw out things he usually wouldn't do.  Have a *discussion* with him where you try to understand his viewpoints in a civil manner, and give your own input and views.You have kids, so grant them this effort for their well being at the very minimum.  You may be able to "de-radicalize" him by sharing views on the subject or at the very least can you understand his perspective or where he is coming from and grow back together.Personally I understand somewhat where he's coming from, but probably any other reply here will tell you to dump his ass right away or something.  And well, if he keeps growing in a "worse" direction and you guys can't come to a conclusion, I'd say divorce might be an option. After all, a toxic relationship isn't good for the kids either.

It's not sleep paralysis. I was taken on Monday early in the morning. I'll post my story here that I posted to reddit.  I was awoken to a foot cramp at about 3:45am. I wake up feeling kind of in a trance state.I felt very heavy and like I had limited control of my movements. I drink some potassium and just wait in the middle of my room for the cramp to die down. I stood for what felt like 6-7minutes. The cramp finally dies down and I return back to bed. As I'm laying in bed for a couple of seconds I hear this low frequency wombo-y sound that happens every 5 seconds. Anyhow, the sound gets faster and as this happen I begin to feel panic. I immediately closed my eyes and as I turn to to lay on my side a white beam filled my eyes. I keep them closed for fear of seeing anything I couldn't unsee and like a second later I started to hover in my  bed. I was pulled through my wall outside and I could vividly hear the trees and everything. I could feel the wind from outside. Anyhow, like 3-4 seconds later I lost consciousness. I begin regaining consciousness and notice that I'm being placed back in my bed. I laid on my side on the opposite side of when I lost consciousness with my limbs spread out across my bed. At this point I believe that everything I've been experiencing is actually real. I check the time and it's 5:08 AM. I wake up and immediately start to have a panic attack. I try to control myself through breathing but it was hard. I stayed up after that and waited till 6am to tell my sister about my experience. Anyhow, after that I've felt a little woozy these past few days. Almost like my limbs are too light for the force I've been exerting to move. It's a very strange feeling so I was wondering if any of you guys experienced anything similar.
Thanks so much!

An easy recipe that I actually made tonight is cooked in a crockpot. Your choice of a roasting beef with chopped carrots, potatoes, onions, and cream of mushroom soup until it all covered, and salt and pepper. After the meat is done, I take it out and shred it, taste for salt and pepper, and let it go for about another 30 min or so. Is good with rolls or something so you can sop up the gravy. ☺️

Even if she was or wasn't embarrassed (because you cant lie and say it's not an embarrassing situation) because she knows the OP and his son's condition it could make her still do the job out of guilt. I think limited contact is okay like hey can you work this day, and that he doesn't bring it up, but ultimately I think she will still feel uncomfortable. Also based on the OPs description of his every day life it's not like he has time to wait for a response, since someone needs to take care of his son.

I'd suggest two separate charts - one for active cases and one for daily new cases. In regards to total cases, you could just have a single number showing a running tally in large font in the corner of one of the graphs. I believe this chart is stacking the bars with both daily new and active counts adding together, which doesn't quite make sense. I totally agree with trying something new though! The last format needed a refresh.   Otherwise - yikes. We are building a daily new cases pattern that is highly concerning.   Ot

To that effect, there is ample evidence to show that all individuals are not equal currently, and that some are preferentially given better treatment.   Gender dysphoria is a recognized condition, for which the best known treatment is transitioning. That is based in scientific understanding.   Laws are elevating protections not to upset the balance... rather they are *reinstating* a balance which has not been there. They are not taking protections away from **you** are they? No, they are giving the due rights and civil protections to those who have been denied equal treatment by the government.   Everyone should have access to medical care, but currently there is still rampant discrimination based on sexual orientation, sex, gender, etc. within the medical field. By fixing these issues, YOU will not be much affected. However, there are many many people who DO need these changes. They SHOULD be equal, but they are not. That’s what the left is generally trying to do. We’re not coming after anyone’s right to medical care/insurance, economic equality, or their personal way of life which isn’t harming anyone. That’s what the Republicans have been doing across the board, though.   The thing about pronouns... it’s just about respect. It’s about respecting someone else’s choice to express their identity in THEIR own way (talk about freedom and American values much?). If you don’t want to respect that, FINE. They are gonna keep on living their best life and not give a fuck about your objections to their identity. They do not owe anyone the knowledge of what is in their pants. So don’t worry about it. I guarantee that there are *much* bigger issues in this world than your grief about having to learn someone’s pronouns. It’s not that hard, if I can do it than so can you.

It's just so strange, in a company that at both an owner and employee level is refreshingly transparent the women's division and efforts being taken with it are entirely a dead zone.
Nah it was over the spring or summer I think. Maybe even older.
Have you tried not blowing up at a comment? Might make you seem, ya know, friendly? A simple “haha na man I know I died right in from of my teammates so they knew who the imposter was, so there was no need to go do tasks as my team already knew who the imposter was” instead you got hella fucking defensive and blew up at me.

I am not impressed with Biden because he was against busing to integrate the schools, and was a creator of the 1990s crime bill that increased over-policing of communities of color. But as you've already suggested, not being a fan of Biden doesn't mean one should find Trump acceptable. If you're not enthused about the presidential candidates, look into your local candidates for other races and maybe you'll find someone you can get excited to vote for. I am campaigning for my local Democratic senate candidate because she's a strong supporter of the Green New Deal and other policies I support.  &amp;#x200B;  I find Current Affairs and Jacobin magazine to be good sources of in-depth political information!

Personally, I think Ravi was a brilliant businessman who made a great living telling Christians what they want to hear. Whenever I heard him talk about atheism, I thought he was a complete tool - but I wasn't his audience. Christians were and they were happy to pay for what he was selling. Capitalism for the win.  I don't think of pointing out raging hypocrisy is necessarily an ad hominem. Besides, the line isn't 'ravi is wrong because he is a raging hypocrite' it is 'ravi is wrong AND he is a raging hypocrite'. His raging hypocrisy is just the icing on the cake.
Great suggestion.  I don't see it here much, but the whole [http://www.exmormonfoundation.org/](http://www.exmormonfoundation.org/) site is great, with lots of talks.  The great Bob McCue and the fantastic Richard Packham deliver several wonderful talks, along with Grant, the Mattsons, John Larsen and others like Lyndon Lamborn and Ken Clark (both hilarious).  Tal Bachman's is also fantastic.
I completely agree
So many shitty takes. So many shitty and unempathic jackasses. I bet if most of the dev's behind Cyberpunk just up and left over this shit they'd be mad at the company.

Right? I have a Pixel 2 that reboots every time I stare at it too hard that I'm still using. *And* you're telling me I waited long enough for a fingerprint reader to come back? I'm in heaven. Still probably will wait to see if there are any good deals since my P2 is still going strong otherwise but the 5 looks great for my needs.
From what I’ve seen, the most compliant people have are regarding the lack of chemistry, the hard to follow storyline and the excessive PPL but these are all subjective (I honestly don’t even care about PPL) so I’d say give the first ep a try to get the feel of it

I think most people hate the pricing. They claim a watch price is 1k+ then "discount" it to the real price. The extravagant designs are to make them seem expensive. They'd be better off just skipping the whole price thing it makes people feel like they're being scammed.
Trump would have insulted the professor and wrote it off.  It wouldn't have made a difference.
Nice! I just picked up a pair of FS52's this week for my 2.0 music set-up. Been loving them. Looks like you got a good deal for a whole 5.0 kit.
and not Hispania?
I can answer the first part.  From the weeks 3/21 thru 6/13 there was no Covid related reason questions.  They started asking for us to “attest” after the week of 6/13 to present week.  You may remember the additional questions we had to answer.  A lot of people were freaking out when they added those extra questions.  So now they asked us to go back and “attest” by answering the questions for those weeks.  The money for those weeks has already been paid to you (the added by feds benefit amount that was paid thru July 25). Hope this helps answer your first question. As for the why of only $71, I wish I could help answer, but I have no idea.
Two handlers at once Mmhm nice!

You make it clear to her that it was your decision and if she continues to give her input about it that you won’t be able to stay in contact with her. You draw hard boundaries around stuff like this to keep yourself healthy. That is what you do. And if she doesn’t stop, then you follow through

Well, I found nothing stating that personal or social wealth was the majority factor influencing voters. It is certainly a factor, but I didn't find any imperial evidence supporting that statement.  The interesting part is that the stock market generally performs better with a sitting Democrat.  Another interesting part is that unemployment is generally lower at the end of Democrats presidential term than the beginning and the opposite holds true for a Republican.  It's very interesting that your stance on the president is based on economy, yet the data would suggest that both the stock markets and unemployment rates are better served by a Democrat.  The numbers regarding job growth, unemployment, and the stock market all improved during Obama's presidency. He did falter on wage growth. This is comparative to the Bush presidency.  Trump has continued the growth in jobs, unemployment (I will give a pass for the huge rise due to Covid), and the stock market. Wages have been better under him as well.  I don't disagree entirely with Trump's economic policy as the results are very good. The same can be said for Obama (Biden VP) as well though.
No worries and best of luck if you attempt to get one!
Nice!

I don't like how you say he's Kaido's DJ like its a point against him.   No one shits on Brook by calling him "just Luffy's violinist". They're musicians, and both have other things going for them. I think the biggest thing that you seem to have a problem with is that every other Supernova has gotten development, while he hasn't.  And my counterpoint to that is to stop thinking about Apoo's story like it's already over. He didn't die in the last chapter. We haven't heard his underlying motivations, his backstory, what happened to his crew, anything yet. Just give it time. Come back to your complaints if Oda kills him off two chapters from now with none of that done.
Yeah my big concern is she had no clue about how money works and no real world experience leading to this very nice list of costly projects
I disagree, in terms of typing its 10x faster to use number instead of the name.  2 keys is less than however many characters their name is.  Especially important when talking in town chat when time is limited.  In terms of comprehension, it is also faster to use numbers.  If you accuse 3 of being mafia, I know exactly who you are talking about and where their name is to vote them up.  If you accuse John Smith of being mafia, I have to find where their name is on the list.
That's a very impressive speed! I did a baby blanket of a much smaller size, maybe only 1,2 x 1,2 m and it also took me 4-5 months doinv it only in the evenins. Well, probably also because of the pattern and a thinner yarn, but still... Well done,  and thank you for sharing, very inspiring!

How would you use seliph in ar defense? He has no player-phase whatsoever, whenever I see him in arena I’m relieved it’s not alm, azura or chrom and I think lif is actually better because he can at least reduce lift loss and give your units some stats, even if spd is not that useful.
