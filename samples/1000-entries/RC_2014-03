If her boyfriend had cancer, would you be giving the same advice? Is it also your policy that when a person develops a severe physical illness that their SO should leave them because they "don't owe anyone anything"?  If (**if**) he's actually having a severe mental health issue, what you are advising is that she knowingly leave someone who is very sick to fend for themselves while making no effort to ensure that anyone else knows they are sick.  She shouldn't necessarily stay forever, but when you see someone bleeding on the sidewalk you call an ambulance and stay till you know someone else can take over.

I was in the same boat when I got mine. Started off pretty slow and only really picked up a small number of titles the first year, but then sometime in '08 I caught the bug and I've been collecting for it ever since. I think it really hit me once the ports reached feature parity with the 360 versions.  Good luck trying to slow down or stop now that you've gotten into it. The system is loaded with goodies to find :D

Siege mercs are easy to take at a low lvl, just dodge the rocks. But depending on how low you are is how long it could take which could be bad for your team.   Objectives spawn very quickly in this game. With the exception of Blackhearts Bay where you need to get 10 coins 1st, but in Hollows end players are level 3-4 when the 1st ravens shire spawned. In Dragon Shire it is even quicker as players are level 2 when the shrines come online.  Since the objectives start so early it would hard to have a dedicated hero to obtain mercs in the early game as they are needed to help with objectives.

Sixers are going to be stacked real fast. This probably means two top 10 picks in a loaded draft, Nerlens Noel joining MCW, and crazy amounts of capspace. Add a 2015 top pick because of all the rooks/sophs and they are going to boomerang quickly.
Some of the Japanese DLC that came out was pretty challenging as well, fair enough. You need to unlock the Hail The Sun song though ;)

You might've noticed I prefaced my original comment with the words "I feel..." =) Everything we contribute to these discussions is opinion unless we're linking to a source, right? I've got my own views and you're welcome to yours.
[Here is a link to the comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1z4h4s/heads_up_speed_camera_van_parked_on_14th_between/cfr7ig1) where I already said I do not hold that position.  For the umpteenth time, my position is that you should follow the law. Breaking safety laws in a residential neighborhood is rude. The act of driving a vehicle is not rude. Treating the vehicle as a toy and ignoring safety rules is rude.  Stop trying to pedantically twist my position, linking to comments you apparently ignored the first time is growing tiresome.

Yeah good point. Reddit has never seen pictures be reposted on Facebook or other social media. The only place he could have gotten this is from reddit.

Im not saying it would escalate to that extent? at worst i'd say a few shots might be fired between them and Ukraines. But, Most likely? Russia walks away with that territory with no resistance.  That land is also very strategically important to the Russians and the EU would very much like to have it taken away from them. If Ukraine joined the EU thats what would happen, otherwise Russia wouldn't be doing this.

Well that's been my hope of solving since I played Portal 2. Because there is no point in brain mapping/mind cloning if it's just a copy. What could be possible is since the mind is just electrical impulses is to make a digital brain that had the exact same structure as your actual one, and do a matrix style link and download your consciousness. It sounds quite far fetched, but hey, science is magical. Hopefully one day.

This thing is great (in a casual format) if you can get mystic speculation at the same time.

Hells yeah. You go girl! 
**TL;DR - GET INT ITEMS ON OD**  &gt; How can I use OD's ulti effectively?  You want intelligence boosting items on OD so that his ult does more damage. Your build doesn't give you any int besides Dagon, which really should be a force staff instead. His Arcane Orb deals damage based on your mana remaining, but that doesn't mean you get items that boost mana pool, such as Point Booster. You get items that boost intelligence. ---  &gt;Point Booster  Let's compare Point Booster (1200g) to Staff of Wizardry (1000g). PB gives 150 mana, Staff gives 130 mana. At full mana, you will deal an extra 9% of 20, due to Point Booster giving 20 more mana than Staff of Wizardry, which is 1.8 extra pure damage. Because the damage-mana pool is calculated on impact, Essence Aura has to proc on the attack, which it only does 40% of the time, so really it only adds 40% of 1.8 = 0.72 extra pure damage to your attacks   However, Staff of Wizardry will give you 10 extra damage from your auto attacks (because OD is an int hero) and also give you an extra 100 damage to your ultimate, because it's based on the intelligence difference between you and the enemy hero. Clearly int items are superior than flat mana items.  --- &gt; Dagon instead of Force Staff  Dagon is a shit item because OD doesn't lack damage. He generally lacks survivability. Force Staff gives him an escape, or an initiation tool, intelligence, and some passive HP regen (which he lacks without Mek). ---  &gt; (if enemy has tons of magic damage) Hood of Defiance  BKB is better than Hood because it blocks ALL magic damage, not just some of it, and also blocks the stun component of spells, whereas Hood only blocks damage. --- &gt; Bloodstone  I seriously don't understand *how* people think of such ineffective builds. Get a Rod of Atos if you want HP, as it also gives intelligence. It's like the least popular item in the game and that's because it's never gotten in the shit bracket which is like 80% of player base. The item gives you 100 HP and 5 int for free, compared to the components alone, never mind the active 60% slow. --- &gt; Assault Cuirass OD doesn't need attack speed. Yes, his attack speed is rather lacking since his main source of attack speed is from Treads, but because of how Arcane Orb's damage works, it's better to get int boosting items and upping the damage of each Arcane Orb rather than throwing out weaker ones faster. He's scales like agility heroes, but with intelligence. Agility heroes gain 1 damage and 1 attack speed with each point of agility, whereas other attributes only gain 1 damage. OD however, gains 1 damage from int, and 9% of 13 (1 int gives 13 mana)= 1.17 *pure* damage for every point of int he gets. Pure damage is important because it is unreduced by anything except magic immunity (which blocks it entirely). As the game goes longer and enemies gain more armour (from agility gain each level), physical damage becomes weaker, while Pure remains the same. Magic damage gets weaker as people afford Cloak / Hook / Pipe. ---  &gt; I get about 60% win rate with how I play OD. That's just because you're playing against equally crap players. When you get matched up with players better than you, you're going to lose because of your ineffective build. --- &gt; Tango, Null Talisman That is not an adequate starting item build, you lack regen. Especially if you're not going Bottle and you don't have any passive HP regen items (Mek for example). You'd easily get harassed out of lane and OD doesn't lack last hitting ability, he has high base damage and can gain damage from his Astral. Compare 3 Branches + Mantle of Intelligence (300g) to Null Talisman (470g) * 3 Branches + Mantle +3 agi, +3 strength, +6 int * Null   +3 agi + 3 strength, +6 int, +3 damage You are paying 170 damage for 3 extra damage and item slots. However, you aren't lacking item slots in the early game, and an extra 3 damage isn't going to help you last hit more than an extra 400 HP from Salve. It doesn't matter how high your damage is if you can't even go near the creep wave because you're scared of dying. You'll miss far more last hits because you can't go into range of the creep than because you lacked 3 damage. If you go Mantle + 3 Branches + Salve + Tango you'll have a far easier time last hitting because you wont be forced out of lane. When you do get some gold, then you could buy Null if you wanted, and then you now have Null, Tangos, Salve and 3 Branches, compared to just a Null + Tangos. If you're going Bottle, 3 Branches + Tango is good. If not, then you'll be sitting in lane for a while and you'll need some form health regen in order to stay topped up on health if you get ganked.

&gt;Why must Celestia and Luna be referred to as princesses, why not monarchs, or queens?  Lauren Faust originally had them as queens. Hasbro changed them into princesses due to queens being commonly seen as evil.  They can't be monarchs with two of them. Sorry, but they are / would be a diarchy.   Price Blueblood was originally a duke but was changed into a prince since it was thought kids wouldn't know what a duke was.

[They can totally get sued](http://m.nydailynews.com/1.1702010). However the stories they run are often so fake that most people don't bother suing them.

Humans are capable of living off of a huge variety of diets and can adapt over time as well.  It is difficult to point to a single way of eating and objectively say it is the best because people have thrived just fine with a variety of circumstances in the past.  It used to be that humans were limited simply by the local environment and what was available either by hunting, gathering, or growing.  Today because of globalized commerce, those limitations are disappearing and now we sometimes have too many choices that it's difficult to differentiate between them.  Eventually, science may come to a definitive consensus but that generally requires time for adequate research into all of the possibilities.

however after much research I think I may hve found something that just might work! http://www.amazon.com/PetSafe-ScatMat-Electronic-Training-16-Inch/dp/B0007NWNM8/ref=pd_ybh_3 This was recommended somewhere else and I may try it! Its a mat I can put in front of the door that delivers a noise or an electrostatic shock not to harm but to scare.

Actually, linear momentum is conserved regardless of the elasticity of the collision. There is no such thing as a "perfectly inelastic" collision, either. There's perfectly elastic, and everything else is considered inelastic to varying extents. In perfectly elastic collisions, KE is conserved, and in ALL collisions, momentum is conserved.  They do state that the puck and octopus slide off together, and that's the only information you need to solve this problem.  You're right about the friction free ice though.
Look on Google Maps. If you put in the postcode (CH48 4DX, United Kingdom) then you can check out the location on Streetview.  Try this URL, and you can see the first page for Brook Terrace.  http://www.findmypast.co.uk/CensusShowPhotoImageServlet?imageName=d665ae9a38e634ae845178bb60177287b1965324cd774708cfc0804227a8225941831742a25857698527e76793fb1457&amp;censusYear=1891&amp;imageStamp=a08310ee7db6a179052b6016b671603c2ca9dde4ad2d0f01a778baeef68c7536c61fbf2cba41a078&amp;desc=1891%20Census%20%3Cbr%3EWest%20Kirby,%20Caldy%3Cbr%3EWirral%3Cbr%3ERG12%20piece%202876%20folio%2065%20page%2012%20&amp;free=N&amp;poorQuality=N&amp;loc=&amp;u=0&amp;l=0&amp;s=0&amp;a=0  Clicking on NEXT IMAGE will give you the second page.

I think there was a thread with tons of them outing themselves as "ephebophiles" a while back. So, yes. 
What if it was an app. Like how banks have secure apps to manage your acc. It would be the same concept. Each state would have there own app that gets updated.you would still have to go to secretary of state to provide the info/ take a picture. I promise you this will happen someday.

I went to Catholic school, where gory pictures of Jesus and the saints abound.  That doesn't make seeing it live-action any easier.  Still by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen.  Never have I been more scarred for life than as an eight year old in a mandatory religion.
Meh, logical fallacies can be convenient half truths bordering on lies, but if you aren't too serious with yourself, you can still get an ego boost out of them :)
I don't know, of course what you like or not like is your business, but I think for most people dazzle spells being physical is part of the fun of dota.   It's like asking why the hell do abilities such as primal roar or naga net goes through bkb.  Why the hell are pure damage spells pure damage instead of just magical, why the hell can certain neutrals tank the same amount of tower hits with only half the HP compared to other units etc. etc.   All of this is burden of knowledge, yes, but it adds to the fun.  The whole physical damage thing is what makes dazzle unique and interesting, so he's not just another support with a slow and a heal and some random utility ult.

Imagine if the government were run like reddit.  Every issue was a post.  Bigger issues reach the front page and generate lots of comments.  Small issues are debated on subreddits relevant to the people who care about these things.  All policy can be debated, voted on, and implemented using a reddit-like system for citizens to interface (and become) their own government.  Log on using your SSN so votes are registered to individual citizens to prevent fraud.  Then the government simply needs to be staffed with civil servants who execute the policy recommendations of the people.
He looks like he can go star in an Indiana Jones movie.

Consider my old fashioned, but there are only two explanations that I see for this degree of modification.  Either she is mentally is or she is doing it for attention (be is sexual or not)  No right person does that to their own body...  It is depressing.
It's a cave that's opened at the surface. Caves in MC generate like a bunch of gummy worms that are distrubuted randomly throughout the map in a 3D field, and imagine that field being overlaid in the Sky over Earth sort of world of minecraft. Some of those imaginary worms cross through the surface, which is where cave entrances are found. Most of the time caves are aligned horizontally but often have vertical segments. note that on the right side of the bottom of the hole, the cave continues off to the right.  I haven't played in over a year and I know this :P
There are a lot of things that came out of Darwin's work that he did not intend at all. For example, Social Darwinism, which was basically used to justify treating everyone else like shit ; the evolution vs. creationism argument, which the media and many people attempt to boil down to Christians vs. Athiests rather than the acceptance or rejection of science argument that is really at hand (Darwin, being a Christian himself, certainly did not mean to spark a debate about religion) ; and of course, our favorite, eugenics.   Evolutionary biology is already a well established field, so there's tons of stuff you could write about, but it would all be science based and that's not very interesting.  For example, you can write about how modern science, specifically genetics, looks in the face of Darwin's original work. That's what I would write about, it being my field of interest, but I get if that's not you.  Or you could go outside the work, which it seems like you are wanting to do. Since I think you're right and it's hard to write that much about one limited topic, if I were writing this paper I would talk about how Darwinism has been manipulated and misinterpreted across the ages by different people, as I mentioned above. That way you could talk about what you were thinking but not be limited to one subject.  Good luck and let me know if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything :)

That last statement strikes as true-ish. People in tech think of themselves as not-govt-dependent at all, which is of course silly. But in a command economy, there is often (if not always) very little innovation outside the context of the state. One should probably acknowledge that, though the broad foundation of the tech industry is of course an outgrowth of DARPA, NASA, and the general subsidization of science in postwar America, *some* of that stuff did happen outside the context of a government agency.  EDIT: I, on the other hand, just hadn't thought that hard about my political ideology, or what the broad-ranging effects of said ideology might be. Just like the "libertarian" 19-year-olds on Reddit who will probably notice that radical economic libertarianism is a disaster, once they get a little older.

The people who fail to know how to use the towel dispenser at work. Pull down the towel it cuts it off and leaves some for the next person. Pull sideways and tear and the next person(me) is stuck using the knob on the side instead of just touching a nice clean towel.
You can go into broadcast settings and just have it save to a file instead of to a streaming service. , then on whatever machine it is on, or display it is connected to, just make OBS full screen and this should accomplish what you need. 
There's also a selection bias because most of these schools are hard to get into. Only kids with parents who have a genuine interest in their well-being put in the effort. 
What new ideologies, the "we want democracy movement"?   I hate to break it to you but that one will never get traction until the people with the money in the region decide it's in their favor. One movement is spreading in the Middle East, Syrian "democracy", 98.1% Egypt constitutional referendum, haha. Either this was the most effective boycott in history or Egyptians are the most single-minded people on the planet. Also notice no international body challenged the results, it was simply a showcase to remind everyone who is charge.  &gt; In fact, the shia military presence in Syria can overthrow the assadists anytime now which they most likely will if the war ends with the regime as the winner.   So Iranians or Iraqis are going to be in charge in this hypothetical future Syria? I can see that totally work for about 12 hours.

As we wish to get to know someone or look for a quick bang, there are those who wish to stop men and women..though primarily men...from seeking such a connection. While there may be boundaries, there is also a time and place for such obstruction. We all have one of these friends who no longer comes to the bar with them.

I did it once too, and tried to keep it inside for about a month before I had to confess to my girlfriend. We fought, we cried, and one of her friends hates me forever as a result, but a year of total openness and honesty has gone a long way in rebuilding trust, and I'd say we're closer now than ever.  It remains the thing I hate most about myself, and I don't think either of us will ever completely forgive me for it, and there are times when I am genuinely afraid I might do it again, but I really do believe that together we can disprove the old "once a cheater" maxim.
According to what records I can find we beat Portsmouth 3-0 that game. The 1-1 was later that year in December of the 04/05 season.

No prob, but yeah if that did happen it would get a higher up in trouble. I have personal knowledge of this. One of my troops sewed on 27 Jan, but they still had him on the ineligible to test list because he had won BTZ and wouldn't have tested if he sewed on his original date, but the system wasn't updated correctly. It was a mess, especially trying to explain the afi to people who are the ones who are supposed to know it. Our flt chief set them straight and sorted it out when they wouldn't listen though.

He needs to get fired. I don't want our first round pick being coached by pringles. It's important that we find a coach who will make it a top priority to help utilize our draft pick's strengths.

I always thought there was more to house Farwynd. The old design of GRRM's website used the sigils of major houses as icons for all the links on the page. Of course there was all the major houses as well as a few that we're not so major, among them were (Dayne, Yornwood, Qorgyle, Beesebury, and  Farwynd... I think) I always figured he picked these houses for a reason that would eventually be revealed. And while there are many ways that House Dayne could figure into the story in a very significant degree, House Yornwood could also play a fairly large role in Dany or Dorne subplots.... But as far as I know there hasn't really been much foreshadowing with regards to the other three

&gt; How do you stop yourself from getting sucked into fights and debates, particularly when faced with astounding ignorance or sociopathy?  "We are clearly not going to change each other's opinions, so we will have to agree to disagree."  &gt; Do you folks have any tips or techniques to divert your attention away from topics that upset you? Particularly when you are emotionally invested in the issue at hand?  Courage to change the things I can, Serenity to accept those things I cannot change, Wisdom to recognize the difference.  &gt; And are trying to help change people's perceptions and attitudes to help make the world a better place? Or is that egotistic of me?  The way you hold yourself out, and live your life can be a way to show others a positive way to view the world and to live one's life.  However, while you can lead a horse to water, if you try to make him drink you just end up with a drowned horse.  &gt; I don't know whether to help save the world and let it tear me apart, or distance myself from people's suffering and focus on my own well being.. it's a very difficult line.. that causes me great anxiety.  Live your life to its fullest, in the happiest and most fulfilling way possible.  Ghandi said "Be the change you want to see in the world".  You cannot successfully distance yourself from others' suffering; we're all connected.  Do what you can within your own moral framework to make the world a better place, and be happy with what you can accomplish.  You cannot save the world on your own, but you can help a little bit at a time.  &gt; Also, it's February in Canada. Everything's an existential crisis this time of year. Sending you all wise, positive, healing vibes... ;)  It's going to be -58 degrees Celsius here tonight with the wind chill.  Hope everyone makes it through alright.  Cheers!

I think religion does have its perks on individual levels but mass religion I think has had its day and I look forward to seeing it subside to reason and logic.   If I was in a similar scenario as the example above, I would live far more comfortably in my present concept of what is and is not rather than deluding myself to believe something I know not to be true. I think this is the growing trend...so maybe it is no longer necessary.

You could, like, try it and decide for yourself.  Patch 2.0 is out now, and it did change the game completely (for instance, I hit level 30 before leaving act 1, and the game is stupidly hard if you want it to be)

Thank you, you are right. I don't think we spend enough time together. I think the chores thing is a surface issue. I think that we need to make time for each other. We are both so busy it is easy to get caught up in the little things. Thank you for your advice.

Sure, that one thing that a person could think.   Another is that junior is too fucking stupid to consider long term consequences of drunken shit they do when they're too young to be able to think further than, "but I want it, and I want it NOW!!!!!"   
This article has a major spoiler (thx for no warning) :/, here is the Interview without that:  *   PC Gamer: Diablo III obviously took kind of a beating out of the gate back at launch. How did you feel about that?  *  Martens: Well "bad" is the short answer. We felt terrible about the connection issue stuff. I know people that sent their families out of town on vacation so that they could sit down and play the game, and they couldn't connect. So that stuff was terrible and I think we've spent an incredible amount of time ensuring that kind of stuff doesn't happen again. We took that very seriously and certainly feel bad about that.  *  I think we did eight major patches on the game. We did many months of support, we added new content, we did big tuning passes. Like anything, best laid plans meeting 15 million people usually means that you're going to learn a few things... or a lot of things in this case. That's what I think I like about expansion development. It's kind of our second at-bat and we know a lot of things about what's actually fun about the game. And we don't have to fight against player instincts or make guesses. We can do what people do; we can see what people like to do, we can read on the forums, and we can interact with them at BlizzCon and other events, and we can make a game that closely matches what people want out of a Diablo game.  *  PC Gamer: Do you guys continue to stand by the decision to require an internet connection to play Diablo III? Is there any chance at all of that changing in the future?  *  Martens: Yes, we stand by it. Diablo III is a co-op game from the ground up, so having the social stuff be there at your fingertips whenever you want it is integral to the experience.  *  PC Gamer: Not too long ago, Blizzard announced that it was shutting down the auction house. Is it fair to characterize it as a failure at this point?  *  Martens: It did what it was intended to do in one way, which was to make trading a safe place to happen without trading scams and other ripoffs. However, it had a very bad unintended consequence of making trading the best way to get items in the game. The fact is that the most fun way for the vast majority of people is to kill monsters and take gears from their cold, dead claws. Trading became very easy. The auction house lowered the barrier of entry so much that it became the best way to get items, and ultimately players will do whatever is smartest. They will find the golden path and do what is most efficient.  *  You should play the game to get gear to kill the monsters. You shouldn't get gear to kill monsters because you will get bored too quickly. It stole people's reward curve is essentially what it did; it made it very easy for them to do it. So trading isn't a bad way to get items, but if it negates playing the game, then we've made a huge mistake. And we did, which is why we're shutting down the auction house.  *  PC Gamer: Sounds like the majority of your efforts since launch have been based around responding to fan feedback.  *  Martens: Yeah. And the auction house decision didn't come easy. It's not like the day we realized it was a mistake was when we could shut it down. A lot of things had to come together for us to get to that point. And honestly, what the console build did with their loot system... what we have now we call "Loot 2.0," what they did I would call "Loot 1.5." They had no auction house inherently, more because they couldn't than anything else.  *  So it's been a learning process for us as well. And finally as the loot stuff came together; as the enchanting system was dialed in; as our new legendaries were coming online, we realized that we could get rid of the auction house and get rid of that reward curve problem without causing new problems of people going back to trade scams or people feeling like they couldn't have any fun gear. Now we can give it away like candy, along with all of these ways that people can upgrade it, and all these crazy powers. And you can get it the way you're supposed to, which is by killing a monster and taking it from them.  *  PC Gamer: What else have you learned since the launch of Diablo III?  *  Martens: I think the randomness thing. We should have made everything random from the start. So the reason we didn't have random exterior zones was because we wanted the game to have more of that real RPG feel; that the world was real and had a sense of place. And like the loot problem, until Loot 2.0 was really dialing in, it was hard for us to figure out what to do with the auction house; it was the same with the randomness. Until the other aspects that made the game more RPG and more connected to the world were dialed in... you know, we've gotten better at storytelling since Diablo III; the world map that comes with Adventure Mode makes Sanctuary feel a lot more real just because you have a map of it, if nothing else, and that's a relatively simple solution to the problem. All of that made us comfortable with introducing randomized exterior zones as well.  *  Paolilli: Yeah, and that's actually one of my favorite things that we've done. With the map you have that sense of place, whereas before I think the environments looked great, but you didn't really have that sense of how everything is connected. And I think the map and the ability to go anywhere and do anything helps.  *  Martens: Dynamic Difficulty is another great example of that. We had our old-school linear difficulty that was inherited from the past, where you had to play through normal, nightmare, and so on. Dynamic Difficulty, which we made for Adventure Mode, allowed us to break that dichotomy for the game as well because otherwise we would have had to have a version of a monster for every possible level. So if you played Act II, we would have to have a Level 31, 32, 33... all the way up to 70 version of every monster for it to be fun. The overall Dynamic Difficulty system removed that burden and let us focus on a grander vision for our gameplay.  *  PC Gamer: On that note, it seems like Adventure Mode is kind of the main selling point of Reaper of Souls. Is that fair to say?  *  Martens: Yeah, I would say that's it. I would call Adventure Mode the primary feature of the expansion. That said, I think Act V is our best act, so we did take everything we learned there. And you do have to kill **** once with one character before Adventure Mode is unlocked. But knowing that you don't have to play story mode over and over again allows people to relax and just enjoy Act V for what it is; and they may or may not come back to it after that, but they don't have to. It doesn't feel as onerous to sit through those things.  *  PC Gamer: There have been some fans on the internet who have expressed concern that Reaper of Souls may be a bit pricey for the content that it delivers. What are you feelings on that?  *  Martens: I don't know about pricing as such, but I would say that the Adventure Mode changes the game pretty much completely. It's totally different. And it's not like a linear thing anymore. You don't just kill **** anymore and the game is done. And I think that was a little too much the case, unfortunately, in Diablo III. That's not the case anymore. When you kill ****, now you're finally starting Reaper of Souls. As good as Act V is, once you get into Adventure Mode and you see the promise of everything random that Diablo does; that makes replayability the point of the game. It's not linear anymore so you're experience is different everytime you come in.  *  PC Gamer: Are you happy with the state of PVP as it is right now?  *  Martens: Well, [Brawling Mode] is okay, and it can be really fun if you've got two people of similar level. PVP is still something we talk about a lot. [Former Diablo III director] Jay Wilson wrote a long blog post a couple Decembers or Januarys ago explaining why what we tried didn't work out. And that stuff is still the case.  *  PC Gamer: What would you say to the players who felt turned off by Diablo III at launch and gave up?  *  Martens: It's crazy awesome now (laughs). You're going to get the keys to the Ferrari. I use the car metaphor deliberately. If you had a Corolla before and you're watching people swing by in their Lamborghini all the time; well, everyone gets a Lamborghini now. Everyone gets a shot at it now. Legendaries are dropping now from Level 10 onward, and we have put code in to ensure that everyone gets some legendaries, and a chance at the wacky powers as well.  *  So the promise of what Diablo can give you, everyone gets a taste of it. And there's still lots to earn for the people who put in the time; they're still going to get better things and more things. But everybody gets some of it. Our game director called that philosophy "endgame for everybody," and he didn't mean that you have to get to Level 70 to start earning Paragon Points to get the endgame. He wanted to take that stuff and move it earlier in the game so people wouldn't have to put in hundreds of hours. However, if you put in hundreds of hours, you still get more.  *  Paolilli: Yeah, we've done a lot of work to make sure that no matter how much time you put in, whether you're having a short play session or going for a lot longer that you're going to get rewarded for that amount of time. We want to give that sense of infinite possibility where the more time you put in the more you will get, but you don't have to play like an endgame player would in order to get rewarded.

The Battlegroups in questions are formed around a rapid reaction battalion from the strongest nation in the Battlegroup (Sweden and Greece). The battalion is supplemented by artillery, air defence, logistics and intelligence that is provided by the other nations in the BG. Additional support in the form of air, naval and special forces assets will be allocated based on the operational tasks the unit is expected to perform.   These units have trained together and are on paper combat ready. (it should be noted that there indeed have been reports on lacking internal cooperation, but these reports stem from 2010 and the Swedish commander promised that the issue would be tackled)  As for the second part of your post  If the Crimea wants to secede that's great for them. They should be given the freedom to do so, provided this happens in a orderly democratic fashion. If Russia forcefully enters the Crimea with the intention to speed this progress along, its an act of war against the sovereign nation of Ukraine. International law will be blatantly ignored and the Russian Federation will (again) put itself above the UNSC and above the Nuremberg principles.  While i agree that the prospect of European troops dying in some (with all due respect) Eastern European clusterfuck just blatantly sucks, we cannot let Russia just annex a part of another nation, a nation that the UK, your country , guaranteed the sovereignty of. Russia can't just be allowed to bully the former USSR around like its 1960. On a side note hampering Russia's control of the Black Sea and in extension the Mediterranean is in Europe's strategic interest. I think it is in Europe's best interest to no let Russia take the Crimea. Me responding to the second part of your post is just my opinion on the matter and it should not be seen as anything else. I respect that people see things very differently. Its a very complicated and delicate matter.   
My day has been something out of a sitcom that you don't think could ever possibly happen to a real person.   I couldn't get a parking spot at the museum I'm researching, the post office lost the cell phone I sold, financial aid denied me summer aid (which means no internship credit), a distant family member died but it shook up my mom pretty hard so I had to deal with that, and then financial aid wrote me again to tell me I needed more documents (how?) for Fall so my application is on hold.   Did I mention it's Friday so none of this can be really dealt with until Monday?   At least yesterday was a good day. I actually found a LBD that 1) I liked and 2) fit me and it cost me a whole $4 at Goodwill. Problem is I don't have shoes to go with it, but with all the crap that happened today, that won't be fixed anytime soon.   Looking forward to my hermit weekend.

Nice read, tlink, although I really wanted you to mention dialectic when you brought up Horkheimer and Adorno!  Thanks for offering some strong examples of semiotics that could actually be used in the classroom.  Now I'm going to attempt to start a gender theory analysis/discussion of *True Detective*.  It's begging for it.  The female characters realize their own sexual desire only through the desire they inspire in the men of the show, as seen in the following scenes (spoiler alert):  1. Lisa (Marty's first mistress), says "You want this?" to Marty as she undresses seductively in the first few seconds of their sexual encounter, implying that her sexuality stems from his desire for her, not from her desire for him.  2. Beth (Marty's second mistress), tells Marty over the phone that she "wants him so bad," but she is admiring her own body in the mirror (presumably imagining herself as he would see her) instead of, for example, looking at pictures of him.  3. Maggie has sex with Rust to inspire jealousy in Marty, not out of her own desire.  She is using her sexuality in terms of its value to men, not as desire for sex in and of itself.  4. Dora Lange doesn't get noticed by society until she becomes an image sexualized in a ritualistic murder.  On a non-sexual level, she is not desired by society until a male turns her into his fetishized image of desire. She is a prostitute, a subset of society that goes ignored until being involved in something sensational, like the sexualized death Dora experiences.  Her own desire is certainly not factored into her tragic and violent rape/death. So, while we could say that the show is objectifying women and pushing commercially-created and unrealistic images of female beauty (and holy hell does it ever--anyone noticed that all the nudity centers around young, white, thin women?), I think it's doing so ironically.  The desire of the women mentioned above is so centered in male desire that it's clubbing us over the head with it.  I think *True Detective* is actually asking us to question the sexuality of the women on the show while simultaneously filling HBO's necessary nipple quota. Driving this point home is this line from trailer-park bunny ranch madam Jan: “Girls walk this earth all the time screwing for free. So why is it you add business to the mix and boys like you can’t stand that thought? Because suddenly you don’t own it the way you thought you did.”  This opens up a whole new can of worms that the latter waves of feminist theory have been discussing for a while.  Who's really getting screwed when a man pays for sex from a woman?  The prostitute or the john?  Also up for theoretical dissection is Marty's treatment of his wife and mistresses and his expectations about sex, marriage, family, and boundaries.  Discuss.

I know nothing of your mother, so I can only speak from my point of view.  I have to fight myself to give my kids the freedom they need to grow up.  My first instinct is to keep them safe.  The second is to make them happy.  Giving them opportunities means that I am giving them the option to fail, to get hurt, or even die.  I can't begin to describe the terror that the thought of losing my children can elicit.  It's hard to overcome my own fear and realize that it's not about me, that they are not children anymore and that I need to trust them and allow them to make their own mistakes and learn from them. I don't always succeed, and often find myself engaging in classic helicopter parenting.  It sounds likely that this is where your mother is coming from.  Fear is a difficult emotion to conquer.  Talk to her, find out what she is afraid of and see if you can work together to reach a satisfactory solution.

I agree big time with the neurological thing. Before i was diagnosed and knew i was properly ill, i kept trying to go back to normal life then relapsing hard. however, the motor engrams that i had built up, the whole nervous system maps for how to perform certain exercises, totally went out of the window, it turned me into an amateur in a matter of weels. I also lost over 20kg of muscle in a month.   I come from a school of fitness that believes that the nervous system is the most important aspect of strength, muscle and fitness, rather than the standard nutrition approach. (though nutrition is still very important ofc)

Nice now im getting insulted, this shows the maturity level around here.   If you say SK is not a top team right now, when for several observers they are the strongest team right now then this means not a single eu team is a top team (which might be what u think I dont know but then u should say it).   If I used Roccat as an example its not because of your flair, its just because they are 1st place in standing at that point and yet lost twice to SK and even mentioned they were most scared of SK.  If for whatever reasons you think SK is not a top team, then maybe give some valid arguments to back it off so ur "text I didnt read" would be taken more seriously.

I'd go with Illyrio Mopatis, something of a schemer and although widely known and of high stature, he isn't in too many scenes/POV's.  When he is though, big things are afoot.  1. Marries Dany off to Khal Drogo 2. Shadily struts through the dungeon in KL where the Dragon skulls are kept.  With Varys, he discusses Lions fighting Wolves and junk. 3. Tyrion's reception at his manse after he flees KL with the Spider's help. He kinda shows his hand here, or as much of it as he feels Tyrion ought to see.  Illyrio is minor in the narrative, operating in the margins of the overall story, but a big time player on a global scale in their world.  Important men at least as far away as Qarth know of Illyrio.  His ability to project power is apparent, he sends ships all the way to Qarth to fetch Dany after word of her Dragons hatching reaches him.  Even though this fails, it shows he has a good intel network (spider.net) and the ability to act on the information provided.  And possibly Bronn,  Saving Tyrion from Lysa's 'justice' and helping to with the Battle of the Blackwater.  Without him, I reckon that Tyrion would have died at a couple points in the story.  Even Tyrion, no stranger himself to wealth and power, is impressed with Illyrio's manse, lifestyle, tastes (the wine cellar) and clout.

Well if the creator's word has any value:  "It was created as an experiment to test the viability of this format, the way people interact with the input system and the way they interact socially with each other."  Based on this, I'd say it's a huge success either way at this point. The format/input system works for playing the game. I think we can all agree that the social side of this has been hilarious, fun, and just plain awesome.

This is pretty fundamental, but it's worth bringing up. As a gunner, make use of the small icon which shows you which direction the driver is looking. If you're driving a tank or LAV through an area that's likely to be teeming with enemy infantry, face in the opposite direction of the driver's turret and keep watch for C4 users and engineers, who would otherwise have an easy time taking advantage of the vehicle's blind spot.

I thought the same thing. It wasn't in the show nearly long enough to warrant a MG release this soon when there were so many better, more exposed Gunplas.   I expect the Maoh and Fenice will be on the way eventually though since the suits they're based on already have MGs. 
It was ok, but I would spend my time on another series. This anime follows the whole MC is ultra op type of thing if that's what you like. The fighting is so-so but I don't recall there being a deep story nor well developed characters.

I think his point was not only that Lu Xiaojun is dirty but also was highlighting USADA's intense drug testing compared to other nations. Many weightlifters have complained about this before so he's not alone.

This is so true of beverages. Slowly start adding less creamer and sugar to your coffee (or tea) and over a few weeks you'll find that you can stomach it black. It may take a little while for your taste buds to truly enjoy it plain (and there is no substitute for fat when it comes to taste). In my own case, I cut out sweets and sugar in drinks and was able to lose those last few pounds for my goal. I got used to Japanese green tea (sencha) without sugar and have never looked back. I look forward to it in the morning because it's warm, has a nice, earthy taste, and keeps me awake!

The thing is, someone who is actually not pleased with how it looks would fix it, not upload it and say that they're not happy with it because they think it's ugly.  Unless someone would somehow force you to upload an unfinished work, at which point you could just say "it's not finished yet but I'm working on it" instead of "it's so ugly".
This guy doesn't :) 
This is a good point to address. Few people realize how much infighting and splitting of priorities there were in the Third Reich. If it wasn't so depressing and horrible it might even be amusing. They couldn't even cooperate enough to decide how best to perform the Holocaust, a goal they agreed on.

Ever since Euromaidan started I've seen comments - never by Ukrainians - saying that the solution to the problem is to partition Ukraine, give the eastern half to Russia and let the west enter the EU as a member state.  Of course my reaction in all cases was "Suuure, because the EU is dying to let in an Ukraine that does not include the east..."

Microsoft needs to do something.  I love Windows 8 but the popular criticisms that we've all heard (primarily the missing start button which is a complaint I consider extremely silly) has eroded consumer confidence in the OS.  Microsoft has more to gain by encouraging adoption of the OS by users and hardware manufacturers than they can gain at the cash register for OS purchases.

So me and my boyfriend are huge fans of this subreddit as I am bi curious and he is, well...just a guy. Lol. So this isn't too long winded and I lose everyone, I was wondering if in the comments of people's posts. If the OP could post the brand or where they got their outfits. Too many times have I seen cute tights or a bra and I find myself searching online after. My boyfriend once saw a corset on here and tried to buy it for me because he thought I would look sexy in it. So what does everyone think? Upvotes are appreaciated if you support the cause!

No doubt the line is blurry on some items. If it was possible to make the line clear, the law would reflect that. In my opinion that doesn't mean someone needs to step into the blurry side by choice. For example Taylor Phinney. He has publicly opted not to use "finish bottles". This is one of the items that sits closer on blurry line. It's not illegal yet it doesn't feel honest. Basically there is nothing on the blurry line that is really justified as required and if you willfully step into it I, as a fan, will not support you. But please note, I am talking as a fan being depressed by the information. I am not claiming it should or should not be banned.   I would say all riders are searching for an edge. But to me there is a difference between a rider that is willing to step into the blurry realm of using Xenon and one that will not. I don't agree with the I can't blame them route. Just because some product isn't on the list doesn't reduce the moral obligation not to do something that feels dishonest.

Back in the '80s my daughters (mid-teens) had a pool party/sleep-over.  The next morning we all went out to breakfast.  The girls were all talking about how advanced they were compared to people decades/generations earlier, so I asked them if any of them knew how to:  * tan a hide  * make soap  * sew clothes  * can vegetables and fruit  * plant/harvest  * hunt  Then we got more current, I asked them which of them knew:  * how to program their vcr  * how the remote control on their tv worked  * how to explain electricity/steam-engine etc.  * how their watches worked  We actually had a good time while they realized that although they had high-tech compared to my youth, they didn't really understand any of it, and had lost much of the survival knowledge that was common in earlier generations.

Hmm hard to pick 3 favorite champs but here are mine.  Jinx - My tip is put emphasis on q over your w. W is just a long range slow with decent damage while q increases your auto attack range and damage. (which is everything to an adc)  Fizz - My tip is use spell weaving to your advantage. Get in some auto attacks then use your w -&gt; q -&gt; e (useing playful trickster to escape or for killing blow.)  This last one was hardest to pick. I really love playing support and I have a few I LOVE useing. After some deliberation this is my favorite. (beat out malphite, volibear, darius, soroka.)  Blitzcrank - He is the best support hands down. Use full tank masteries and full tank runes. (armor quints and reds) Open with q then get e then w. Emphasise E then W then level your q last. Useing talisman of ascention in unison with boots of mobility + your w makes you literally impossible you catch. Meaning you should rarely if ever die if you know when to run. His pull is better than thresh's but it takes accuracy and instinct to make good ones. Don't spam your q it costs alot of mana. Capitalize on the enemy walking out of position rather than you trying to get into position to make a pull.

A spin-off of a previous attempt to clone Windows 95, development started in early 1998, and has continued with the incremental addition of features already found in Windows.  &gt;ReactOS is primarily written in [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\)), with some elements, such as ReactOS Explorer, written in [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). The project has been ported to the [ARM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) and [AMD64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD64) processor architectures, and partially implements [Windows API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT) functionality. The latter is assisted by including parts from the [Wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software\)) compatibility layer for [Unix-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems, but other functionality is implemented by the developers themselves. However, progress has been hampered by a lack of developers with relevant skill-sets.  &gt;An extensive [code audit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_audit) is in place to protect against legal problems, such that implementation of the Windows API is only done by means of a complete [clean room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) [reverse engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) process. The audit was initiated following claims made in 2006 by a former developer that the project contained [disassembled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler) [assembly code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) from Windows.  The allegations did not conclusively prove the existence of − and the audit has not found − any legally compromised code, and the claims have not resulted in any adverse legal consequences for the project.  Nevertheless, the audit has since been turned into an ongoing continuous effort as part of a generally cautious approach.  &gt;====  &gt;[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/G7oqS35.png) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ReactOS_logo.svg)  ---  ^Interesting: [^Wine ^\(software)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_\(software\)) ^| [^RosAsm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RosAsm) ^| [^Comparison ^of ^open-source ^operating ^systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_operating_systems) ^| [^Mozilla ^ActiveX ^Control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_ActiveX_Control)   ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfrcp2w) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cfrcp2w)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&amp;subject=Glitched comment report&amp;message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 74955:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/Romania/comments/1z3uhi/sts_posibil_cutremur_it_în_românia_microsoft_nu/cfrcoyi)

I've been saying that smart watches won't catch on in any more than a niche sized market and I would never buy one. But if this came to fruition, damn I'd be all over it.
Ehhhh I don't believe you. 
I was thinking more like Facebook, twitter, Netflix, online gaming, and other things that are Internet-based. A wasteland not only in terms of mass unemployment but also in terms of what they're using the Internet to do.   Although, to be fair, Netflix and Hulu should be considered TV. Haha
A socket is just a thing you can send data to/receive data from. In IP, packets come from, and go to, an IP address, and a port number at that IP address^1 . Together, the IP address and port form the "socket address".  www.reddit.com:80 is a socket address. Combined with the information that I'm using TCP, it is all the information I need to send data over the internet.  ^1. That includes packets going from the server to the client. There is both a remote and a local port number. It can be a little confusing, because, even when actually programming clients, one seldom thinks about the local port, which is automatically assigned, but often thinks about the remote port, which tends to be something well-known like 80 for HTTP.

I keep....interesting company, and I can say that none of the fake ID consumers I've tracked down who've been caught have had any legal consequences. It's usually a confiscation and that's it. Most bouncers don't care, most cashiers don't care, waitresses and waiters definitely don't care enough to try and get you in trouble with the law.  It's rare. I'm thinking that the few times it does happen, someone goes yelling warnings on the internet and makes it seem like it's a common occurrence.  Although I will say that it's a possibility that a store owner might hand in confiscated IDs to the police. After talking to a couple, only a couple, owners when buying liquor, it seems that they're a bit more venomous towards fake ID users since their liquor license is at stake. However, even at that point, you'd have to be immensely unlucky to get the one cop who feels like a hero, who's able to track you down, is willing to work his way through the red tape, and manages to charge you.

Good question. No. (I'm assuming you meant "shouldn't gay sex be allowed by the Church", because obviously gay sex is currently legal now). The OT has 3 types of laws: civil laws (national), ceremonial laws (those laws dealing with proper cultic worship), and moral laws. The civil laws in the OT are only applicable to the theocracy which was ancient Israel. In the same way that it wouldn't make sense to obey the United States law about driving on the right side of the road when you are in Great Britain. The ceremonial laws were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The moral laws continue to apply.    So for the law that OP mentions, the moral principle still applies, and yet the enforcement of that law (the penal codes) were only applicable for that time and place, since the penal codes were part of the national laws. Those are the types of laws that all nations must have to be a nation.
True, but let's not bias that distribution according to the population being pictured... That's just what I'm saying.  Please don't get me wrong. I love Dramas. Movies like Schindler's List and Requiem for a dream are some of my favorites of all time.

&gt;“This board will not bend its will to ideologues who proclaim their ‘right’ to post whatever they want, wherever they want. This is no more different that posting sports scores to /r/gaming.  This is both someone who spends very little time at /r/gaming and very little time actually learning about what constitutes news in the 21st century. /r/games might have been a better subreddit choice because of how strict they are, but what do you expect from someone with an absurd amount of tunnel vision.  &gt;We have a very specific set of rules which are written to enforce a very specific moderation philosophy: Quality content, nonbias, objectivity and factuality.  Slides directly from the government isn't considered content. Slides directly from the government are obviously biased, because, umm, they come from the government? But wait, that's the content. Oh shit, it looks like this power hungry mod thinks it's biased because the government releasing the slides is actually the content? It's not supposed to be objective. You don't interview someone from the government to comment about what the government slides are, in fact if you did that you'd get nothing but propaganda, which is apparently news to these mods? Factuality sounds like trutheness. You just made up a word, didn't even give it a definition and expected everyone to know what you're talking about.  &gt;A more reasonable criticism would perhaps relate to the effectiveness of /r/news’ existing ruleset. Indeed, there is an argument to be made that perhaps the rules of /r/news barring analysis should be opened up to allow stories depending on context and importance.  The person in charge with making and enforcing the rules thinks it's theoretically possible that the rules need to be revisited to actually end up displaying news, and only came to that conclusion after a massive shit storm. Fucking brilliant. "Context and importance" gee I wonder if that's like almost the definition of what makes something news worthy. The idea that someone like that is in charge of a subreddit like that is what keeps reddit a sad joke of power hungry mods with personal agendas who care solely for what they care about, and get off on banning anything that doesn't fit their personal ideologies. Change /r/news to /r/BipolarBear0 and remove it from default subreddit and give /r/news to people who are actually interested in news.

And I thought me and the hubby were bad....  In our front room sits: (including the retro collections) Wonderswan, GBA GBA SP, master system, playstation 1, 2 and 3, xbox360, wii, sky box, his 32inch, my 24inch, we both have laptops, both have smartphones, and I have my tablet.  Not including the 3 small bookcases full of books and DVDs, the multitude of games across many platforms in 2 6ft high bookcases, the smaller bookcase filled with DVDs

&gt; This article is embarrassingly terrible.  Your post isn't much better.  &gt;&gt; The wealthy do not buy real estate except to speculate or to get a good return on investment.  &gt; the economic ignorance of this statement is so profound I don't even know where to start.  I would call it more of an exaggeration. It obviously applies to appartment complexes, commercial property, and those single-family homes that NINJAs were buying a decade ago and have been foreclosed on during the last few years.  &gt;&gt; In 2008, the Charles G. Koch (billionaire) Charitable Foundation agreed to give millions of dollars to the economic department of Florida State University.   &gt; that bastard, giving is money to higher education!   I wouldn't call economics "higher education".  Mainstream macroeconomics is a pseudoscientific religion that helps capitalists acquire and retain wealth and political power by confusing the masses with fairy tales about nonexistent equilibria. For ideological capitalists like the Koch brothers, it's just a cost of doing business and another weapon in their ongoing war against the working class.

There are multiple types of ways Vicodin can be prescribed. The ER doctor will write a script for a large pill that has a lot of acetaminophen in it. There are smaller pills available that have more Vicodin but less acetaminophen.  I got into an accident a few years ago and had this exact scenario happen. Large white pills from the ER doc that seemed to help, but not 100% and not for long enough. I talked to my regular doctor about it after a month and he told me about the other option, which are small and orange (in my case at least). I don't remember exact numbers because it's been so long but it still had some acetaminophen, just a lot less.

*She was already lost ages ago.*
This was proven to be a pretty false assumption when that pilot hijacked that plane a couple of weeks ago and flew to Switzerland. 
I agree.  One typically doesn't want to maximize the "chances of selecting the *best* apartment in the lot" (thus considering the second-best as bad as the worst) but "the quality of the apartment chosen".  So a cardinal payoff variant seems much more appropriate.  However, I would choose one where the *a priori* \[quality\] values are drawn from a Gaussian distribution rather than a uniform one (one argument for that is that the "quality value" of an apartment is probably best modeled by the average of dozens of different random and somewhat independent criteria, so a Gaussian distribution makes some sense).  Funny that this variant is not mentioned in Wikipedia.  Another thing which confuses me is the following sentence in the cardinal payoff section of the Wikipedia article:  &gt; To be clear, the interviewer does not learn the actual relative rank of each applicant.  He learns only whether the applicant has relative rank 1.  Why this assumption?  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to assume that the interviewer knows the relative value of all the applicants seen so far (including the rank, among them, of the applicant which is now to be selected or rejected).  Is there a reason to make the decision only on the knowledge of whether the applicant is the best so far?  Does it change something?  I'm confused.

Here's the thing, though: I don't know if gen 2 will capture lightening in a bottle twice. Even if we start fresh and allow for new lore, new narratives and stuff to evolve out of gen 2, I just see it following a similar path in a more "forced" way of being like gen 1. It's like, we've been through these motions before. If people start worshiping some new item because it gets "consulted" frequently, it won't be the same organic narrative as it was the first time around; we know that people are just "copying" the first run-through, so to speak.  It would have to come up with something completely new and be completely different to really "start over".

Sadly, people believe in "States Rights" and "Small government", meaning that each individual county can decide what the curriculum and what textbook will be used.   Also, I don't know what high school you went to, but if you take American history in high school you'll get a lot of this information. 
Hands are VERY complex, lots of joints, wrinkles and different proportions , all of which need to be correct or your drawing will end up looking like crap.  In addition, you have A LOT of information internalized about what your hands look like: they have 5 fingers, of certain sizes, one of which is the thumb (and he behaves differently). But all of that information is generally incomplete or wrong, as your experience is influenced by your perception of reality. Then, people's drawings have (in my experience) large thumbs (they're very important and thus, represented as big), the phalanges are out of proportion (the last ones are bigger, see: thumb) the palm is misshapen and the knuckles are way too big or absent, etc.  TL;DR How most people draw is dictated by experience and not observation. Hands are complex, thus we draw them like crap.
Those are just examples to give people an idea of what they could look like, using the styles for that race and an "expected" look (Sorcs in light armor for instance).  You are not limited to those armors.

It's actually pretty easy to enforce on regular websites. You, the copyright holder, send the DMCA claim. The wensite owner has to comply and remove all the infringing materials.

The game is favorable to rush decks *for now*, since those players are only winning vs their best matchups.

Yet I'd venture that the people who did use them were not exactly aware of these "major" issues at the time (captain Hindsight to the rescue)... And such a crash could have happened just the same without any advance warning (now that the easy prey is gone, let's see how some of the allegedly more secure exchanges fare over time...)  But the fact that I have little sympathy to extend to people who gambled their money away on BC and MtGox, doesn't mean I support a system where companies handling other people's money have no more accountability than your average door-to-door salesman.  If it turned out that the surgeon who did your bypass surgery is in fact a plumber moonlighting as an "unregulated" practician at the local clinic, being told afterward that the guy "had known issues" with his practice, is not going to do you a lot of good.  That's precisely what a regulating body does: ensure that you, as a consumer, do not have to personally go and audit the product (/code/skills) of the company you are entrusting your valuables with.  Raging libertarians might call it Nanny state, the rest of us call civilised society.

And even then, it usually lasts only for a short period.   you say you put yourself in their shoes, then the rest of your post shows that you don't understand how to cheer for a team without a once in a generation player.   it's fitting you're a lakers fan because you just can't fathom that people can actually enjoy sports regardless of whether their favorite team is a contender or not.

Can't wait to see human resource managers on a list like this in the future.   Description: Human resource managers were employed by mid to large organisations in the early 21st century, initially as internal recruiters. But soon their responsibilities grew larger as a result of making up a plethora of rules and regulations for just about anything you can think of. As the scope of the rules widened, companies employed more HR staff to cope with the work load. At the HR era's peak, many companies ended up with a ratio of only one engineer, managed by up to 15 HR staff. As output suffered, most HR departments decided to let go of the engineers and other workers so that they could focus more efficiently on making up more elaborate rules. Eventually this led to the great HR bubble of 2056 that caused GFC 5.   These days most HR department has been replaced by the relatively new concept of common sense, a resource that was vastly over looked earlier this century.

I have a 22k Art Nouveau gold locket made in the 1850s that I paid $300 for, but that type of jewelry brand new would easily by over $2000 with all of its elaborate detailing.  Plus, there is this awesome history attached to it--knowing you are wearing something that has existed for over 150 years is pretty cool.

No, because poor people wont have it
good to know you're able to think for yourself 
Indeed, there are many ways to be "X-com'ed" in Impossible.  That's part of why about 1 in 5 or 6 of my impossible runs even get out of March.
That at least has an element of surprise. The killer still has to punch through a wall. I'd take it. The alternative is just lazy. 
Congrats!   I have heard that for some people, when they become lucid they fall into that suspension of dark space thing.  I've never experienced it myself, but I think there are tips on how to get out of it, like closing your eyes and walking, imagining a scene, and when you start to hear and feel things around you, opening your eyes. That sort of thing. But I am not sure on that.   My first lucid dream involved someone being in the dream that I haven't seen in years and that I have a complicated and emotional past with.  I got in an argument with them, and somewhere in my rage, my dream self yelled, "Why are you in all of my dreams?!" and I immediately became lucid.  My husband had told me what lucid dreaming was, and I was amazed at what was happening, but I didn't know how to stabilize or anything so I woke up a few seconds after unsuccessfully trying to make things appear and happen around me. After that I actively started trying to lucid dream, and my first intentional lucid dream I achieved using FILD.  Now that I have spent more time trying to achieve lucidity, and I'm more familiar with my dreams in general, I often become lucid without needing to do reality checks or things like that, kind of like how you describe how you just suddenly knew you were dreaming. Pretty cool.

Anything oil based is a huge no-no with condoms.  I'm not sure if anything is generally worse or better - oil is just bad with latex.  And petroleum jelly is oil-based, if you were wondering.
Oh god I hope we aren't moving onto Gold. It won't nearly feel as epic or original anymore. Please let's all remember this as an awesome experience and end it at that. I really don't want to have a conversation in 6 months with my friends with the words "TPP went really downhill after the gen 1 playthrough".  To the downvoters, please let me know why you disagree.
No, I am open to new information. Can you cite the paper that concluded that the earth is 6000 years old based on Zircon crystal data?
Sure, I didn't actually mention it anywhere. I got my training data [here](http://www.statmt.org/wmt12/translation-task.html), look under the section Downloads. The data I used was from the french-english parallel sets, but it might be easier to just use some of the non-parallel news crawl data (there's 5 languages in there).  You'll want to download the tools as well, to tokenize and lowercase the data, and you may want to remove punctuation before training, as the data will resemble the test data more. Note that the tokenizer.perl script will convert some punctuation to html codes like \&amp;quot; so make sure to handle that, or use the deescape-special-chars.perl script from [here](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/tree/master/scripts/tokenizer) to undo that part.

The sky appears blue from inside our atmosphere because the light refracts (bounces around). The blue part of the light bounces around more, so that's what we see. From the outside however, we're seeing the light that is reflected, not refracted. It is a subtle difference, but basically it doesn't bounce around and therefore we see clearly.

They are their own proof that heaven does exist. I make this killer lamb dish he refuses to eat. Lamb chop marinated in olive juice garlic and rosemary. I grill them and then saute black and green olives for the garnish, then sprinkle it with feta, it is to die for!
He's got no feelings for her, so what's the point of making you insecure, if you pointed out she's behaving like she's interested and then he replied with "We slept together before you and I dated" I can guarantee you'd get alarm bells in your head.   What I'm saying is, unless something inappropriate was going on or she was harassing him, then it'd be important to have details, but considering he most likely doesn't engage her or even particularly care there's no cause for worry here, everyone has a past. 
Yes. Then in atleast one of them I'm a jedi :'(
I studied too and failed tests. Not all college courses are about tests; that is largely dependent on your major. My degree was in Animation; my grades were all about projects.

Yeah, I know. I have my own unmarked copies of 40 and onwards, but refuse to share them! I just don't understand why they stopped printing them.  You could just go to kinko's with the PDFs and ask them to print them out and bind them for you. It probably wouldn't cost much.

His last words were "I can't breathe"  it was intentional as far as I'm concerned.  Police force as a concept are designed to keep men from running amok.  Men build the pyramids and then steal the treasures within, its a societal control designed to impede men's nature.  I'm not surprised as cops have gotten more violent and militarized, more and more men are killed.

Can confirm. Google employee, and most of the people I work with don't have degrees either. We are talking engineers. All kinds of engineers.   I see some things in here about "the hell they don't" and the like. Chances are your "friend" or you just were not up to the standards that are set in place. If you know your stuff, you're fine. It will play out through interviews. Certs are not relevant here, due to brain dumps and the like. Well, unless you know them. The interviews will rip you apart. I know, I've been conducting level 2 engineer interviews for a few weeks now (and previously), I'm a gatekeeper for your position.   Another thing to keep in mind is culture fit. If you're a bad person, condescending, talking trash, etc I'm not going to recommend you for another interview.   The great thing about this company is that your future is in your hands. Want to screw around? Cool, you've got a few years with the company, but eventually you're gone.   Lastly, our recruiters don't know jack. I've had many of interviews where I read the resume and wonder how in the hell the person is even getting an interview. Others, I interview and wonder why they put what they did on their resume: "I'm proficient in python"...great! Answer question xyz: Ummmm. Get the point?  I recently refereed a friend who never spent a day in high school, he has no GED or HS diploma. He never stepped foot in a university or community college, zero credits anywhere. Had Facebook and Google fighting over him. Facebook won because they moved faster and the bureaucracy at Google is getting bad.

James Harden.   I used to be a big fan since he was at ASU.   Then, I continued liking him on OKC.   But now, he's turning into one of my least favorite players in the league. I like Dwight as much as I hate Harden this year which makes me feel conflicted about Houston. 
It almost makes one think people become romantically involved when they're *not* at a good part in their life.  I think one shouldn't be clingy in any relationship, but the requirement of having to lean on each other in order for it to work out is something you can't learn how to do unless you're attached. Maybe no one anywhere knows what they're talking about.

Reading through his blog makes me think he's just a little insane. Like, just a bit. Only enough so that when you look into his life you notice it after a while. He's a weird dude. I'd love to make music with him. But I think he's a bit nuts.

&gt; but to most of humans its irrelevant  I don't think that's entirely true. Most people only use a browser, and Firefox and Chrom(e|ium) work on nearly every Linux distro.  I was very close to getting my mom to switch until my father convinced her she needed MS Office. But most people don't need Office, or any MS-only software for that matter. A browser, image viewer and music player will suffice, and most people aren't too attached to any specific one.

This actually happened to a lady who is a close family friend. At one point, she worked at a convalescent home; not just for old people either. It was for folks who were a little nuts and couldn't take care of themselves. One lady there has this disorder. She thinks EVERYTHING is food, as in she'd eat her dinner and then start trying to eat the napkins. As you can guess, she ended up morbidly obese. She was too fat for the showers, so they had to take her out back and hose her down like an elephant. Since she was so fat, she had a lot of rolls, and they couldn't get everywhere. Now, one day the family friend is making her rounds of the complex, and was stopped by this dude in a wheelchair. He mumbles something at her. "Bitch stole my Doritos..." "What?" "That fat lady stole my Doritos and SHE WON'T GIVE 'EM BACK!" "Okay, okay, calm down. I'll get your chips back for you." She goes into the fat lady's room. She's in their with the chips and nothing else. Buck naked, with her legs spread. There's this thick almost gelatinous discharge in the fat lady's vagina. And she's dipping the chips. And eating it. With that cheese drip on pizza stretch effect. She apparently had this big smile as it dripped down her chin.
I agree wholeheartedly with everything on the aformentioned forum! Congratulations.
The science behind it doesn't suggest breaking the laws of physics, simply bending them. Cheating if you will. From what i can remember, and i may be very wrong, it works in a way that compresses space time in front of said spaceship and then re-expands it behind. There is then less space between point A and point B. However i think this theory all comes down to the proof of negative energy and creating lots of power.
Yes, people still play Savage! Obviously not as many as there used to be but some community members are working on trying to bring new, as well as old people (back) to the game. You can check the [server list](http://www.newerth.com/?id=serverlist) to see how many people play and when. There are times with about 60+ people on the EU server. Not sure about the US server.
As someone who spent 12 months in jail, I can vouch for this. Once you get used to eating "bricks" as they where called, they actually taste pretty good. But that was because jail food, by comparison, was horrible. Not even the roaches ate it.

Mexican Army would be destroyed..... by the US Marine division based in So Cal...  Plus pretty sure the San Diego Sheriffs Office could beat the Mexican Army hands down and then go to coffee.   Try another example....

&gt;You label yourself gay, you aren't inherently gay. There are men who have sex with men, and women who have sex with women, but do not label themselves with the identity of "having same-sex sexual orientation".  They are, by definition, gay or bisexual regardless of their *identification*.  ...maybe "gay" has a different meaning in Cyprus. But in the English language it is a sexual orientation. Men who have sex with men (at least willingly for pleasure and not forced to) are, by definition, gay or bisexual, whether they identify as such or not.

Playing metal in NZ, there's isn't a huge pool of bands to support international acts. So as one of the bigger in the country of the niche I got to play with a lot my favourite bands. The Black Dahlia Murder was a highlight and I even got to meet Tim Lambesis when As I Lay Dying came. The guys from Dahlia were awesome and actually wanted to hang out with locals, but Lambesis was really dismissive when I told him he was a huge influence. It's still kinda cool none the less. As result though, I kinda just realised that even though they're talented musicians we're all the same.   It could be different for other people. That's just my experience with it :)

Supply and demand.  Lol.  Microecon textbook.  Lol.  You think that because it's in a textbook it must be true????  Come on.  You clearly must have missed all the news these past few years on all the PERSON-BASED PRICE-FIXING that has been going on across virtually every market.  Gold, LIBOR, housing, currencies, equities, etc.  It's all people. Supply and Demand is who the indoctrinators misdirect you to while they pick your pocket.  The nice thing about "Mr. Supply" and "Mr. Demand" is they can't be sued, or held accountable in any way shape or form.  Cartels determine prices.  Organizations of people set prices.  There are three different grocery store chains a few blocks from where I live.  I compared prices, and there is little to NO price competition between them.  They have an oligopolistic understanding.  It doesn't matter if I go to one or the other, the price is the same.  Where is the magic of market competition driving down prices, lol?  They have a captive "market" and they know it.  Read up on company towns to get an idea of what I'm talking about.  The demand is created by brainwashing through the mass media.  I presume you're at least under 30 or 25, possibly under 20?
Hi there. I am a coffee farmer in Hawaii. We do not use hugelkultur methods. We do have constant mulch build up from other trees/fruit composting/ macadamia nuts/ and an annual hard pruning that gets shredded back to the land. We use over 40 free range chickens/rabbit droppings and Inga bean( Ice Cream Bean Tree) to fertilize and fix nitrogen. Given your username is it safe to assume you are in Canada? Are you growing the coffee outdoors or in a greenhouse? We do use many trees for companion plants. But without knowing your ag. zone it's hard to recommend.

Re: Kids smoking: I take my son to the skateboard park. Last year, every time I did, teenagers would come up to me and try to buy a cigarette off of me - so many of them! Of course I didn't let them have any.   Two days ago, we went to the skateboard park, and one teenager was vaping, about 10 were smoking cigarettes, and all 10 were giving the vaper a bunch of shit. So kids are still smoking. Some are vaping - I haven't seen a ton of them making the big switch though.

It's not necessary, but drier does seem to be more efficient. If you have wetter bud, there's probably water in there that is going to come out as water vapor... so your first few hits will have some water vapor mixed in.  On your second point, I think wetter and less vaping would increase the potency of your AVB.

This question occurred to me when i was showering last, and i started to think about what exactly i must smell like after using blackberry shampoo, coconut bar soap, and strawberry conditioner. I just usually grab and use whatever is handy, after a quick read to be sure what type of product it is, heh.
You mean former copp
Or non-theist. 
I take it in case there is free food being offered, and as a member of a huge Mexican family, there is always going to be free food if I stop for a visit.

&gt; you guys are getting ahead of yourselves.  ... Sorry, but this, conflicts with this:  &gt; This topic's aim isn't to alienate one job from the other  Your post's wording is fairly hostile, and I don't think a lot of people will appreciate it.  This being said; a BLMs dps is going to be higher on Turn 4 because of mob groupings, flare bombs, and a lot of Fire 2 spam. I say this as a SMN who raids with a BLM of similar gear level and skill. SMN has a lot of utility that BLM doesn't have, some of which applies to Turn 4, such as keeping a Shadow Flare under dreadnaughts for slows.  If the community's decided SMN is worth *actively avoiding*, are we sure it's because of their lower dps, or because of something else?
Yeah it took me a bit longer to figure that one out 
Mine still says pending, and I didnt get one back. You need to add my name

I almost feel bad posting since many of you ended up splitting with your partners, but my relationship got better, believe it or not. When we were in college, we spent a lot of time alone and I was very comfortable being myself with her. This was before even I knew I was trans so I'm just talking personality wise. Since we graduated, I became more withdrawn and depressed. I was extremely nervous about coming out to her, but when I figured it out for myself, I knew I had to tell her and soon. When I sat her down, it took me a good 15 minutes before I could actually say anything because I was so scared that this could be the end for us. When I explained everything to her, I made sure she knew that person she was with in college was me, everything else was me acting like a man. She naturally had loads of questions and she was confused about herself (is she bi or gay), but there was never any doubt that we were going to stay together. Since then, she's been extremely supportive and as I've been able to let more of my personality out, we've only gotten closer. We laugh together constantly and just genuinely love to be in each other's company. I hope a positive story like ours can encourage someone to know that it can work out.

It's nothing to be ashamed about. Money makes the world go round. You cannot deny that it's measurably used to gauge a person's level of success, stability and viability as a partner (especially if you're a male). Money isn't all that matters but you should do everything in your power to bring more of it in your direction unless you're adversely affecting someone else (we all have to look ourselves in the mirror). Money is the ultimate insurance policy against most shitty things in life i.e. legal matters, health issues, employment instability, mortgages, student loans. It may not save you from an oncoming locomotive but it helps in just about every other situation.

Sorry but there's no way the Jags AND Browns pass on a QB
Fellow creep crusher,  I do agree with you!
[This bot](http://np.reddit.com/user/last_cakeday_bot) is really fucking morbid.  also realistically it's all a question of age. babies and very young children always get adopted. some people want to raise children from (basically) birth. and for that matter getting a very young child from another country is much easier and cheaper than in the US.

Don't forget to upvote this game thread for visibility!
I'd give re-installing the drivers a shot, there are links in the sidebar for both the GPU driver removal tool and the AMD driver site. Both the uninstall process and re-install process are pretty straight forward.  As far as Walking Dead Freezing I do know that that is extremely common with that game, so the driver may or may not fix that. But try it and then come back and we will help you out the best we can.
I'm a psych major right now and am facing this very dilemma. I feel like I should change my major before it's too late, or at least minor in biology so I have more options once I graduate. I really don't want to go to grad school.

Tracks just as well, too.
Actually, you're right. How Plutarch (might be Plato, don't remember) describes it is much better.
I think that the pre-Soul Society arc episodes had a certain charm that was lost afterwards. I find bleach one of the easiest animes to re-watch because of this.

Well thank you :D 
&gt; Yes, because you are supposed to do only the stuff from your job description, which makes perfect sense  Such a coddled generation.
Okay.  Fuck you too.  Just because someone makes a point doesn't mean they are obnoxious.

Thermocouple power source?  Magnetics is about the only way. You'll have to custom design it. I envision something like a transformer/buzzer arrangement could be made to work. Depends on how much current your power source can supply. 
I definitely shouldn't have read that as I'm ready for more and have months to wait. I guess it might be time for a reread of the series.   Great cover too!
Yeah, you let it sit to let the chlorine out, it's honestly not the biggest deal if you run out and have to use straight tap but it's definitely better to do it. As for the strips, I know they show you pH, I've used those things in school and for fish tanks and stuff but there's something off about them. I pretty often find myself asking people the same question I asked you and 9/10 use strips.
oh wonderful!!

It's not even cold in Chicago right now. The weather says just below freezing. That. Is. Not. Cold.  Cold for this time of year, yes.
She will not owe any tax.   $10K is under the annual gift tax allowance, so she won't owe a gift tax.   You mentioned to us the UNRELATED FACT that you were helping her with something, but she is NOT paying you for that work.  If she were paying you for work, she would owe capital gains tax on the part of the value that was unrealized gain and you would owe income tax on the full $10K.  But since it was a birthday gift, none of those taxes are due.  When you sell that stock someday, you need to know your cost basis.  It is the smaller of what the stock was worth when given or when purchased.  So if she purchased it for $12K and it is now worth $10K, your cost basis is $10K and the gift is a poor idea for tax purposes (vs. her selling the stock and giving you the money to invest).  But if she bought it for $8K, your cost basis is $8K, and the gift may be a good idea compared to her selling the stock, paying tax on the gain and giving you the remainder of the money.  Assuming she bought the stock for less than it is worth now, you will someday need to pay tax on her gain.  But meanwhile those delayed taxes are invested for your benefit.  So even if your tax rate when you finally sell will be higher than her rate today, it may make sense to pay those taxes later at your rate, rather than now at her rate.  If your tax rate will still be lower when you sell, it makes even more sense to pay that tax later and at your rate.  All that is US tax rules.  If you are one of those from another country asking tax advice online and expecting us to guess what country you are in, I apologize for being an "arrogant American" who assumes that anyone who asks tax advice online without identifying the country wanted USA tax advice.
THIS!  Why would any country give up or stop making nukes now? You can be sure Russia would not be invading if Ukraine had nukes.

I know I haven't heard great things about the ride feeling with the Rough Country, but are they really that bad? with all of this extra stuff I will need it seems like I will need a lower cost lift to stay in budget.
This thread is like 50% lube jokes, 20% incest jokes and 30% actual comments   There's something about gay rights that seems to cause redditors to compete with each other to see who can come up with the most unoriginal sex joke !
I have to say, this is a cool idea in theory, but they pulled it off badly. It gives no real information about the move, and seems more like something just meant to draw attention.  Might have been good to have the seed be the phone number of the place, too.

There's a particular pizza place in Albuquerque (where the show takes placed and is filmed) that everyone in the cast/crew loved.
