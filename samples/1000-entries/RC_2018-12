I LOVE THIS
Ye made that bearable, thank you all
wait what
This dosent belong here
Same. I would have missed some cool stuff.
I wish I had your humor. It irks me to no end to hear people say one thing and do the exact opposite. 
In an alternate dimension where planes are boats and the Earth is flat...
Thank you for sharing your tribute to Ruby. May your good girl rest in peace. Hang in there. üíô

I would note, however, that you are outside the Morridor.
Well then, the free ones. Like I said. Just the free ones. Also, they‚Äôve been releasing Season 5 Emotes all Season 6. I guarantee you they could bring back the Season 3 &amp; 4 ones
Iirc, he lost the save on his Xbox for one reason or another and can't be bothered to replay it.   Edit: NVM THOUGHT YOU MEANT SKULLS OF THE SHOGUN. SORRY.
you should to the same exact tactics but short instead
I'm sure *a* dad thinks you're swell. 
Wait, that‚Äôs not normal?
I know it's in a realm of science fiction but I wish their was a dream recording device. I have had some amazing scenes that have stuck in my head recently.  Edit: First dream. A drive up a hill turning into a village with a imposing temple in the front of you that you drive under.  Edit: Second dream. Being in a woolies/coles where all 4 walls of the shop are glass and open. Letting you to walk in and out with ease. Surrounding the shop were open plazas between buildings with vertical marble stair cases and gaint white skyscrapers. It was like a shopping centre with the roof taken off and integrated into the cities roads.
my brother would do this
Not rly a shitty gift tbh
Well we work opposite schedules so we only see each other on the weekends. It‚Äôs already tough enough to finish a conversation in one day over text but I do my best to be affectionate. It would be nice to see it reciprocated more often than not.
in the meantime, they held hands at Hillary's HQ on election night, and Gaga sent Katy for her first show of the *Witness* tour. They like each other.

I do like that is party exclusive. So as a party you all get 5 sparkling venture tokens etc. pretty neat 
If you pass NNN you are on track to heaven
Buff the burst to the way it was like in season 3
Kevin Williamson made a great point on this:   &gt;The focus on gun shops isn‚Äôt about effective law enforcement; it‚Äôs about bureaucratic laziness: It‚Äôs a hell of a lot less work to lean on federally licensed retailers with fixed addresses and regular business hours than it is to go chasing Joe Gangster‚Äôs rap-sheet-free little brother all over Baltimore on a misdemeanor charge. In reality, the authorities do very little to counteract straw purchasing, because it is a difficult crime to prosecute ‚Äî see Special Agent Jones and his ‚Äúreally hard‚Äù standard above ‚Äî and nobody‚Äôs career gets made on a straw-purchase case.
Sorry that's so long, there's a tl;dr at the bottom if you don't want to read it all, but I tried to go in depth about why I prefer it over not just vim, but any other editor/IDE (focusing on vim though).

Thanks but my fucking game crashed not even five minutes in
It‚Äôs a first for me! I swap batteries all day but this ones my first

Yeah, but I think there's more to it.  Apparently she was denied use of the bathroom because she was 'known to the staff'.  Not sure exactly how they know her, but I'm guessing she has a bad reputation with them.
My entire team is full of hype train RBs. Conner, Mack, Chubb, Gus, and now Ware. With Ertz, Mahomes, Adams, OBJ, MT this is by far the best team I've ever had.  Zero RB strategy treated me well this season 
Well my dog is named Agumon so my heart says that since it's my favorite digimon obviously but I also don't want there to be any mixup, and my doggo would be jealous.  So runner up is probably Impmon. But I almost wouldn't want to choose, I'd want it to just be assigned to me because it's heavily suggested that digimon are basically extensions of the soul and that's why people lose their minds whenever their digimon dies.  
Nope! This gentleman called our sales department and just wanted to upgrade his furnace. Sold and discovered upon replacement! He‚Äôs lucky to be alive

&gt;It is disappointing to know our young airmen produce and accept these indecent drawings in a deployed location, which is completely the opposite behavior seen or accepted at their home station location,‚Äù the investigation determined.  Hahahahahaha. Asking people to stop drawing dicks deployed is like asking them to stop breathing.   &gt;‚ÄúHis failure to stop the creation of the drawing while deployed despite the extreme mission stress.‚Äù  As if drawing dicks stopped the fucking mission, this is ridiculous. 
Not here. We had 4 in my area within the last few years. 1 is left and it's the one that has been there forever. 2 were in very busy areas.

One of these reasons me and my buddy quit dota was because of the time we had to sink to stay updated with all the items and builds and each hero and everything. While it is definitely really cool we just dont have the time anymore.  With hots, I consider it a fun yet easier game to play. Dont get me wrong, once you get to high tier of ranked games become really competitive. But because of the lack of items and no need to deny creeps and every team sharing so. Just a really dumbed down version. However I'm still going to play it because I'm a filthy casual and it's all I have time for haha. Welcome to hots.
Hahaha

Fine, then let's get to the root of your argument then, instead of accepting the premise.   "Job creation" isn't a benevolent activity, it's a required part of a business owner trying to enrich themselves. They need workers as much as workers need a job (or at least, they do until they don't) - we shouldn't be thankful for their magnanimity, and we shouldn't give them exemptions from the other requirements of being a citizen.

I used to be but years in the customer service industry has helped. I used to be really quiet. I‚Äôd never ask anyone questions about themselves like other social butterflies. I‚Äôd never respond to compliments with like compliments, or sometimes I would just smile awkwardly and not even say thanks.  After going from job to job, getting into sales, taking myself and my work more seriously, I think I‚Äôm starting to become a normal person. Today I started a new sales job and I went up to every customer and had conversations with them, sold them things, I responded to questions about myself and compliments like a functioning adult.   Hopefully I get some friends now üòî

Obviously this video is entirely about his opinion of what makes a hero shooter good/bad or fun/unfun. Maybe he is only trying to say that Paladins is a "deeper" game than Overwatch (although he is overlooking and dismissing a lot of Overwatch's depth) and I am characterizing his argument incorrectly. However, this subreddit and my interest in Overwatch comes from a competitive perspective, especially in the balancing and design of heroes. So, I am less interested in his opinions on characters and game mechanics now that I know he is not valuing or evaluating these aspects of the game for the same reasons.
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Thanks for the sincerity.  I don't really feel any real changes coming to Brazil in at least two decades time, staying in Portugal sure isn't permanent for me, I already had plans on going to the US as it's surely a better prosperity opportunity but I need a first step somewhere else for now.   I appreciate the useful info and I sure will look into getting a job arranged for me before anything else.
Some paints come with a solution you mix with water for this purpose.  It etches the concrete to help with adhesion.  You can use phosphoric for sure... And a few others.  Be sure to neutralise it before painting (baking soda + water iirc)

I've told my partner (who is nonbinary) basically that I'm questioning and uncertain and they're very supportive. I have no doubts that they would be the biggest support if and when I choose to fully come out.  I have other friends (one in particular is also nonbinary, come to think of it) that I could come out next, but I think my cis friends and parents would be the hardest.  The biggest thing stopping me is how big of a lifestyle change I'm worried it will be. I live in a fairly rural, conservative area right now and I'm going into a traditionally conservative field. My goal right now is to finish undergrad, and then see what happens from there. I'm 21 now, and I don't think waiting a year or two will matter much if I choose to transition.
Thanks but I don‚Äôt have not even one if I get him I may try it out because ik they hit hard enough so there‚Äôs no need to have a support sometimes 
I thought his verse had been fixed, no?

It‚Äôs a 2002 HK movie trilogy called Infernal Affairs. An Indian (to be released in India) version is being made. Brad Pitt‚Äôs production company got the rights for a Hollywood remake in 2003, and got Martin Scorsese to direct.  The HK version (and it‚Äôs sequels) is considered one of HKs most successful releases. The video game Sleeping Dogs was inspired by it.

Mods, there's [too many good flairs in this chapter not to make](https://imgur.com/a/onYoL48).   I feel like that at the end relic is what transforms people into a Narehate like Nanachi without completely killing them and that it works on the IF Units as well. Part of me feels like this will also be Reg's origin story. I mean, it seems that Faputa became the thing that she most desires, like Nanachi. So, would it be a stretch to think that the IF Units would most desire to be human so that they could fit in more easily? I mean their mouths. They all have that [saw tooth design just like Reg's little hair band](https://i.imgur.com/XrGrNlb.png) ~~it's a little less saw toothy.~~ ~~but aren't egg shaped relics supposed to be really common with little value~~. I'm just spitballing here.   [Something about this Guy](https://i.imgur.com/QK9vopS.png) reminds me of [Srajo](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/miabyss/images/3/31/Srajo_Manga.png/revision/latest?cb=20170710013551).   Akihito really nails [this look.](https://i.imgur.com/5nN3K2J.png) That sense of wonder and excitement towards something new. It's the exact [same look that Mitty](https://i.imgur.com/W4K8YbF.png) had.   The mother/daughter relationship of Faputa and Veko is too good. I *really* hope that there's no bad blood between them in the present. Please don't rip my heart out Akihito.   [Faputa's fear of abandonment is also explored.](https://i.imgur.com/f9LMT4P.png) I guess we now know why she was so broken up by Reg leaving her and not remembering who she was.   I really really hope that he's foreshadowing us with some of these monsters. They look too sick.  Also, if you don't read the chapters while listening to the anime OST you're really missing out. It just fits in perfectly.   See you before the end of the year! Hopefully! 
The document pictured literally says nothing about Hillary Clinton.   The tweet references Anthony Weiner, who was literally prosecuted for sex crimes involving a minor, but even then, the document itself makes no actual reference to Weiner. 
When did they stop?
&gt; That said, it could be a shitshow if Brexit is anything to go by.  I reckon you see something akin to a misinformation "arms race".   Dozens of You Tube channels, all pushing agendas and misrepresenting facts to that end.   Astroturfing in comments sections and social media to an extent that makes what we have now look like a minor issue.   The papers, and other media, would go into overdrive. Because they'd no longer just be trying to push people into voting for a party that supports their goals, they'd have to push people into opposing each element specifically.
"Ghost people" seems to be the nearest I can render it.

I'm surprised there aren't more posts about this since yesterday. It's crazy! I feel no incentive to play with everything done, knowing even after a ton of high XP contracts and conquests I'll barely be any closer to a tiny, insignificant bonus. It seems like they were imitating the paragon system in Diablo 3, but in that game those levels are cake. Playing on the highest difficulty with a full set bonus and refined build, you could get several paragon levels per play session. I really hope they plan on adjusting the values because otherwise it comes off as a very scummy way to sell boosters.
They have sex and then lay eggs
Before I even knew anything about radical feminism or queer theory, just basic sociology, I would get pissed at questions that asked for gender instead of sex. I would always answer N/A. When I signed up for Facebook in 2006, I was raging because it made me choose a gender and you couldn't make it private. I never had a damn gender and never will, but I'm a woman and a female no matter what the hell I think or do.  I learned recently that Ruth Bader Ginsberg is one reason gender became a popular term for sex, though. Because she couldn't say sex in front of men and be taken seriously. Fuckin men.

It depends how many of them want to spend that money.

Exactly.  This issue is making me sick right now.  No, I‚Äôm not racist, but yes, we don‚Äôt need or want open borders or birthright citizenship.  This planet is ridiculously overpopulated and the US doesn‚Äôt need to be the pressure valve for that. Why can‚Äôt there be a political platform that is pro-environment, pro-universal basic income, and anti-immigration? The issues go hand in hand.

Who knows. I moved to PGD in week 38 and they‚Äôre sending me to Academy week 46. But I‚Äôve heard people have been in position months before going to academy.  Make sure to check your email, they‚Äôll tell you there.
Nope. There‚Äôs nothing more than I want to win the PL. So I would be over the moon.   Right now however we‚Äôre on the verge of not qualifying for the CL. And City are top playing amazing football while we‚Äôre grinding out results in the PL. It‚Äôs not great signs 
Not really sure sorry i couldnt help maybe the others can

No you idiot. You're talking about the Rock. Turok is the name of famous actor Dwayne "Turok" Johnson.
To soon have a take on Courtland.  You'd love to see him have a signature game already--but he's "the guy" for the next two years or so and will have every opportunity to prove it.  Whether he does is anyone's best guess.  Alshon should be more valuable than Courtland, but in most leagues Alshon is as illiquid as they come so it should be a win as people will still be seeking Courtland atleast through the next 8-10 regular seasons of his career.
Anyone above about $5m net worth is eccentric.  Below that, you're weird, below $50K you're just crazy.  This assumes identical behavior from the people at each level.

Thanks! This is great. Can I ask a couple of followups?  &gt;If it's a crime scene, they can't go in without permission.  Let's say there's a very long night of questioning at the scene/at the police station and they decide it's a clear enough case of self defense not to charge Charlie. Does that make it not a crime scene? In other words, does this mean Charlie and Betty are allowed back in once they decide not to charge, or would they still collect evidence just in case?  If they are prevented from re-entering their home, roughly how long do they have to stay out of the house? (e.g. a day or two, up to a week, several weeks)

It was certainly toned down in BF1 once DICE LA was given the game. You could actually see outside buildings that you were in, and it was especially apparent on Sinai.

Hi! I use tinted contact lenses (sometimes). The ones I have cover the iris - they are entirely tinted.  I have albinism and therefore am photophobic and my acuity varies wildly depending on lighting.   Take the following with a grain of salt because everyone is different   The pros : - you can add sunglasses on top of them  - you can choose the tint you want (there aren‚Äôt a ton of options, but there are a few gradients)  - they are pretty effective in situations with fluorescent lighting - better acuity - I can read a  line Lower than with regular contacts (not the whole thing but a good chunk of it) (like from line 2 to 3)  - good in snowy, reflective environments   The cons:  - they are thicker than regular contact lenses (or at least that‚Äôs how they feel to me). It takes a little while for me to get used to then when I pop them in, but afterwards it‚Äôs fine. - I have yearly contacts. The closer I get to the end of the year, the less comfy they get and the less I will wear them - my main issue with them is that I‚Äôve had multiple pairs and after a while I have trouble focusing with them . Probably an issue with how they fit me personally. - the ones I have make me look creepy.  - not great at night, unless I am going to a concert. Makes the bright lights less annoying.   That said, if you are photophobic or light sensitive, they are definitely worth a try. They take some getting used to, but if they turn out to be a good fit, than that would be excellent because I do see sharper with them (at a certain distance) and most importantly I am not as bothered by the sun or crappy overhead lights.   I don‚Äôt know where you are located but when I was in Canada i couldn‚Äôt find them (actually got laughed out of multiple optometrists offices....) so it would be about finding someone who is more knowledgeable.   I live in the Uk now and the eye hospital here is amazing. I get my contacts from them the overall  care at my eye hospital is top notch. Regular follow-ups and check-ups.   I can find out what the brand name of my contacts are if you‚Äôed like.

I bet Trump's reaction to this outrage will not even approximate his verbal beat down of the NFL over players taking a knee during the anthem.   NFL and NFL team owners have no honor or principles what so ever any more. Ive stopped regularly watching games or even following the NFL over the recent years, I just can't stand the self righteous and privileged attitude of many of the players these days. Plus the games tend to suck of late because they spend 1/4 of time reviewing the minute details of every call and every rule. I hate that, take the call on the field and play the damn game. And NFL players - get over your self's already.  &amp;#x200B;

It could go catastrophic in a number of ways. She could be cold and make remarks like, "oh, what happened with the last girl?" if you bring some new girl over. She could call the girl by a different girl's name and say it was an accident. She could give you a lot of shit, saying that you don't know how to stick with one girl. Make dumb remarks like, "hope you don't catch something!"  If the roommate is toxic and especially if she's hit the wall, I don't see this going well at all.

The first step in shorting is being able to borrow the asset. For instance, if you borrowed REP and sold it on Binance, you'd be short (hoping that the price declines) REP. If it declines, you can buy it back cheaper, repay the borrow, and come out with a profit.

To be fair 747s are designed to fly in atmosphere, using the atmosphere itself to achieve lift, and only using fuel for forward momentum.   The HH uses thrusters to lift. A better comparison would be to VTOL jets such as the harrier, only on a massively increased scale. They can't stay in VTOL for too long because it absolutely chugs through fuel keeping a hunk of metal in the air using vertical thrust.

The suit was expensive upwards of 700 for the jacket and slacks that came with it . It was also a graduation  gift so even if it costs around  100-150 it would be worth it  as it was free.

Hi young lady. Unfortunately what you described as poking is only your boyfriend's very awkward but also quite common way of expressing his desire to have sex with you at that very moment. Can he stop? Yes. Please understand that at this young age sex is on his mind 99% of the time. If you both are already sexually active, the best way to get him to stop would be to mutally agree on a new way for him to signal his desire. 
That‚Äôs good to know.  How do you find out if a town is a headache or not unless you actually buy a house and find out?

I can SEE it
**Rewatcher**  Two quick things to clarify: Phos' legs are not powdered in a stripy pattern, despite looking similar to that most of the time. The lighter layers on their legs are a different material all together and the entire legs are unpowdered, seen most clearly in [this shot from today](https://imgur.com/FwAnKiS)  The Amethysts did not actually split into two despite the initial reveal making it seem like it, the second one just walked up from the back of the room out of view of the reflection before they did their little dance. (Trivia, the 'pattern' of twin gemstones known as 'Japanese Law' is the angle of 84Àö33", hence their numbered names).  ---  *Sorry for the wall*  So in my infinite wisdom I gave myself only an hour and a half to write today's post, and then decided to cover one of the most possibly complicated topics: Buddhism. (My Sword of Damocles post took over three hours and I was already exceedingly familiar with that myth)  **Houseki no Kuni and Buddist Symbology**  Buddhism is a large part of Japanese culture, and many asian cultures. Unfortunately Buddhism is an incredibly complicated religion with many different sects, particularly between each country, and I'm mostly familiar with the Chinese schools. However there are some core associations and symbols that transcend across all the relevant schools and those in particular I found particularly interesting from today's episode.  Buddhism has many different tenants and philosophies attached, but the one I want to focus on today is the 'Three Marks of Existence' which states that all of known existence is impermanent (always changing), unsatisfactory and non-self (soullessness, not really covered today). If I wrote this post later I'd be able to say more on the other tenants, but I think it would be interesting to cover it now in a basic way so people could have this perspective while watching later episodes.  ---  While not specifically a Buddhist symbol, the butterfly symbology pops up a number of times today, [one lands on Phos](https://imgur.com/LcQOLOm) and the Lunarian's sunspot today gives a vivid image of a [human figure with butterfly wings](https://imgur.com/LEBCVvH). Impermanence is what ties into this, the idea of perpetual change. Phos exemplifies this most vividly in today's episode with the function of their new legs revealed, and quite dramatically. Sensei's note here that Phos has particularly strong inclusions only held back by their frail earthly body ties greatly into our first Buddhist association below.   The Lotus is a particularly symbolic flower in Buddhism. It is one of the Eight Auspicious Symbols that hold great importance, representing the enlightenment that can reach up through the muck of earthly existence and unfold into something beautiful. While not visually related to a Lotus, Amethysts role in this episode draws on the concept of one. During our first meeting with Amethyst, the camera pans down to the water as their two figures [unfold](https://imgur.com/uBlWEI7) from one another like the [unfurling](https://imgur.com/D4wsdOp) of a flower over the water where we have previously seen Phos spend a lot of moments contemplating their purpose and role. Lotus plants are always drawn with one, three or five stems, never two, and so Phos joining them completes a required set of three. In joining with the Amethyst twins, Phos is able to rise out of the 'muck' they have been stuck in all this time as their role as the youngest and weakest of the gems. Purple Lotus in particular represent mysticism, so this is not just a physical growth for Phos but a spiritual one in understanding their place in this world (more on this later).  Despite Phos' dramatic change and the strength they can now use to stand up and forge their own existence, there is still a deep unsatisfaction present. While they are quite strong now in some ways, they still find them-self unable to effectively do many other aspects of this role they had hoped for. Despite the huge progress, the bar has simply been moved ahead once again. The end result of this perpetual cycle of change and unsatisfaction is this painful mirroring between the loss of [Phos' legs](https://imgur.com/eKfD2d1) in a previous episode and the shattering of [Amethysts joined arms](https://imgur.com/bkIx4vs). Phos who is the only gem with a true awareness of mortal death finds themselves inert. Though most gems would not see the difference between [death and rest](https://imgur.com/tvSsTuM) due to their regenerative capabilities, Phos who now sees the 'death' in their friends on the moon, and having suffered the lost of their own self with the loss of their legs memories is struck all the more by the risk the gems are burdened with because of their physical bodies despite their immortality.   ---  [The empty throne](https://imgur.com/uc1UI9K) is another important visual from Buddhism, representing the seat left behind by the Buddha when he achieved enlightenment. Last episode, without telling anyone Phos achieved an awareness of self in their determination that prompted their legs to move again. Leaving behind an empty seat as the only sign of their achievement for those who looked, until Yellow Diamond, the oldest and one of the more spiritually broken of the gems is able to find them again and guide them back to the others. Shortly after this we get a scene where Phos' brutal honesty, as we have seen through the show, shocks the gems to silence, honesty being one of the five precepts (rough western equivalent: ten commandments) of the Buddha's teachings that Buddhists aim to follow, teaching them through their own experience the value of honesty and change. (I'm not saying Phos is a Buddha for clarity, only that they are closest to the teachings as of now due to their awareness of mortality and experiences of change).  And lastly, the shot that started it all by making me decide on this post for the day, [The destruction of the Lunarians](https://imgur.com/saSTv63) at Sensei's hand, turning them into a cloud of colored dust. The [sand mandala](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYVcjFhpsHc) while being a Tibetan Buddhism ritual rather then Japanese, ties in greatly here. No two mandala's have the same meaning or purpose, each is unique, much like the gems, but in a broad sense the creation of a mandala is a way to connect to ones role in the universe, the collection of positive energy to be bestowed on others, and a 'house' for the deities being called upon, much like Sensei is a center for the gems. A very important part of all mandala's is the ritual destruction of it at the end, the important representation of it's impermanent state, that material things do not last. Sensei's destruction of the Lunarian's giving that vivid throw of color across the sky, as if destroying their 'house' from his mandala and sweeping it clean of their influence.  [Some stuff for the rewatchers](/s "One aspect that I will quickly mention is also that Phos' agate/shell legs, and later their gold and silver arms are three/four of the Seven Material Treasures that pop up in Buddhism as well, materials that represent various parts of faith, virtue etc. I'm NOT going to go too much into this because firstly not all texts agree on what the treasures each are strictly, and also that's a whole other matter that goes way, way deeper into symbology. But if you're interested that's also something to look at. Just remember not to go to Phos' wiki page looking for answers, its not safe")  ---  **Screenshots of the day!**  - Visual of the day: [There was also a hell of a lot of pyramid (shape, not building) iconography in today's episode, but that's a WHOLE other post so I'll just leave this here instead](https://imgur.com/AEIOjV4)  - Line of the day: [I'm pretty sure the rest of that sentence would be "I've got a lot more work ahead of me"](https://imgur.com/pvZcO23)  - Expression of the day: [I love when they unashamedly give characters unflattering expressions, best pre-laughter face](https://imgur.com/QLqRGGZ)  - Phos face of the day: [The seconds before disaster, also I'm still fascinated by how gems blush through their powder](https://imgur.com/qjZGao2)  -------  **The Many Faces of Phos**  The three featured faces of the day are a ["Terrified Phos"](https://imgur.com/K6kET9z) from me, /u/thefezhat shares a ["Tied Phos"](https://imgur.com/7nAxOET) and u/thecomicguybook gives us a ["Tired Phos"](https://imgur.com/qQpiTiU) resting against Ventri.

I spent 16 minutes yesterday trying to explain the concepts of "copy and paste" to an emotionally sensitive user who kept repeating "I'm not tech savy" to every instruction and getting continually more distraught.  I had to explain to a user that if the new manditory two factor authentication we put on the email because the users keep giving away their dagum passwords was something I could "help" them find a way to "not have to do this every time" it wouldn't be very secure.  I had a user hang up on me since they refused to believe that "the computer is incapable of working without electricity," saying they knew it wasn't MEANT to but that doesn't mean it wasn't happening and that is what we need to fix. "Can you check for a backup power source it may still be hooked to," was apparently very offensive.  "My computer is frozen, but I can't reboot it because I'm in the middle of something critically important now and I can't be logged out waiting for it to boot back up." Well good luck with that, because you are essentially logged out already. It's FROZEN. The mouse won't move, nothing will type, the ONLY option is a hard reset. Deal with it.  "I don't want you to fix my company issued computer I want you to fix the Mac I bought because my company issued computer is too slow. I did not spend 2000$ to still not be able to work." Yes you did, since we don't put personally owned devices on the secure network, and half our software isn't supported on Mac. All we can do is fix the computer we issued you, which you should have called for BEFORE buying the Mac.

I am absolutely not planning on doing that, don't put words into my mouth. But nice "attempt" to throw my own logic back at me I guess lol.  I'm also not as stupid to compare a not launched game that has only just started its marketing push (they do have to avoid overlap with big titles like RDR2 ya'know) with big titles that already have a standing, like the Division, or games that already have years and years of content, like Warframe, or games that have tons of DLC put out already like Destiny2.  Can Anthem compete with the amount of content of Warframe and D2 right out the gates? No, probably not. Can Anthem match up to a game with an already developed title like the Division 2? Lmao, no. And who would expect either of those things? It's unrealistic. That is my only argument. I'm not saying blindly follow them, I'm not even "pro Anthem" in this particular discussion, I am simply "pro reason".

Oh I hate this tweet so much. Misinterpreting the Goldstein reference and citing one columnist as if they're indicative of some dark path down which *the whole country* is running is nothing short of blind hysteria. Furthermore:  &gt;Come on NZ, this is NOT a road we want to go down.  Fuck off. I find it so hard to articulate to torrent of thoughts I have about why this is dumb and disingenuous. It lacks substance. It lacks basis. It's used in place of an actual discussion of the relevant issues, usually because the person saying isn't actually intelligent enough to do so. It's used to massively overstate the problem, if said problem even exists. It's used to advocate suppression of ideas. It's used by people who think they personally should be society's moral compass. It's patronising. I hate everything about it.

While right, this is probably not the best way to convince her. It is better to start with empathy.   She is right to worry about the little one. They are so fragile. Maybe talk about the risks of infectious disease. How would she feel if you sister got deathly ill because of this decision. How would she feel standing over her and worrying if she was going to make it.   Balance it out with the fact that she is right to worry about autism, and that it is frustrating that doctors don‚Äôt have a cause that they can point to. They are working really hard to figure it out, but there aren‚Äôt any easy answers. When it was suggested that vaccines might be something to look into, they did, extensively. If there is a connection it is so tiny as to be easer ion Ly nothing.

I'm not, I'm bisexual. And if we're talking about sexuality, if it's relevant to the discussion, calling me a bisexual male does not bother me. I understand that I am technically a minority and this description has relevance to the topic, so there's nothing to get upset about.  Like /u/bertcox said, it depends entirely on the context. If it's a mix of sexualities, like two gay guys and me, one bisexual, the label might be useful to differentiate between the guys who don't like women and the guy who does. But like they said, if there's just a bunch of, say, bisexual guys around me there is no point for that label.  But I sure as fuck won't be called a "cis male".

My trick is to log all food.  It's teaching me portion sizes.  I let myself go over my daily calories, I've been using my calorie limit as a suggestion.  I'm losing weight slowly with this method, and learning portion sizes and self control.  I'm eating less than I did all these years I had trouble losing weight.  When I eat out I try to look up the restaurant's menu and see if they have calories listed. As I've lost weight, exercise has gotten easier (less work to push around a smaller weight).

Tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the Buddha and make prayer beads from it.

The fact that you see this as hyperbole is proof that it's not. My entire point is it's getting kids from a young age to see 24/7 surveillance as normal and harmless.

&gt; anything from the cases that was negative for the halo was listed as neutral its important to remember that  I can imagine that's not because some sort of FIA-conspiracy but rather because none of the accidents could have been *worse* with the Halo, it just wouldn't have made a difference.  &gt;or different designs.. this has been kneejerk engineering  Apart from the Halo there was Shield, Aeroscreen, [this](https://www.jamesallenonf1.com/wp-content/uploads/AFP.jpg) and [this](https://www.jamesallenonf1.com/wp-content/uploads/Roll-hoop.jpg). And if the research they did in 2011/2012 is included, they also tested  [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgHh4V0WYCs) and a [full canopy and something that looks similar to the Aeroscreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GSmNuaNGI8). You don't have to like the Halo, but I don't think it's fair to claim that it's been kneejerked as if there had been no research or testing at all.

Ray Rice got excommunicated from the NFL, but he knocked a bitch out. 
So many Ps4 games. 
&gt; I work in construction. Sometimes we use large granite stones for seating walls or whatever. The tolerance on these MACHINE CUT stones is to 1/4". This means, even though we may get four of the "same" stone, they will not be exactly identical. They can even be so far off sometimes as to not be usable stacked next to each other, because of the profile differences.  &gt; These stones are more precise than what we can do and we have no idea how they did it.  This is exactly wrong. These techniques have been repeated in the modern day.  The reason that you can't compare it to the tolerances of your modern construction projects is that you're using blocks that were manufactured to fit with any other block. THAT was impossible at the time that the structures in question were made, and is a much more impressive feat.  On a small scale, what they did is trivial. You can take two sandstone blocks of about 5-10 lbs. and just rub them together until they've sanded each other down to fit perfectly together. Now you put the next one on top and repeat.  For these blocks, however, more sophisticated techniques are required because they're too heavy to just rub together freely.  Modern recreations have used simple tools that would have been available (straight edges, string, etc.) to measure and then file down the stones to fit very, very closely to as perfectly as these ancient structures, and that's someone with no real experience in doing this. These civilizations spent hundreds if not thousands of years figuring out how to do this through trial and error and lots of master-to-student teaching.
^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***  I‚Äôm on mobile, so do forgive any spelling or formatting errors.   Let‚Äôs dive right in...  Lately my (25F) live-in boyfriend (29M) has been encroaching on my ‚Äúme time.‚Äù   My ‚Äúme time‚Äù hereby being time I elect to go watch a show I am into he doesn‚Äôt care for in the bedroom while he watches TV in the living room,  or take a long ass bubble bath, or sit at the kitchen table coloring instead of being in the living room.   Lately, he‚Äôs had a habit of following me after 10-15 minutes.   He‚Äôll come into the bedroom while I‚Äôm trying to watch a show, and attempt to talk to me, tell me stories, show me memes, etc...Which is all well and good, but I‚Äôm trying to watch Stranger Things for the first time and it isn‚Äôt a good show to interrupt every few minutes.   He also will come into the bathroom while I‚Äôm having a bubble bath and sit on the floor by the tub. Again, to tell me stories, show me memes, etc.   And as for interrupting my coloring, I like to zone out with my headphones on and he will come up and take them off/wave in my face until I pay attention to him. Recently, I asked him to please leave the bathroom so I could continue my soak in peace. This appeared to really upset/hurt him and he has been acting a bit akin to a kicked puppy since. So, Reddit...AITA for wanting my alone time to be...Mine to spend alone? *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am angry with Hulu- their interface is the WORST. I just realized the other day the new season of Younger was added- did Hulu give me any hint it was? Nope. Super random shows I don't even watch are on my front page. Now that I have started watching it, does it suggest I continue the show? Nope- still have to search for it to bring it up. WHO designed their interface?!

Yup agreed. I actually think S2 presented Shichimiya and the issues with Rikka's romance really well. In contrast, the movie failed to address and advance the core issue of their relationship: Chuunibyou and Rikka's future, especially in regards to prospects for college. I found their travel and running around immature and unplanned well.

Manipulative and uncompelling comparison. Organ donation is an choice to potentially extend a person's life. Having an abortion is a choice to certainly end a person's life. They cannot be compared.

Yes, cw is stupid pricey.  Lots of great brands for much cheaper.  I can vouch for the following, phytodabs, extract labs, lazuras and my favorite tweedle farms (flower which works best for my arthritis). Lazuras charges like $30 for 1000mg of full spectrum cbd oil.  Again though consider flower, it is imo the most effective way to consume cbd by far.  And the cheapest.

You're one of the rare ones.  I have friends from all across the financial spectrum.  One friend is broke with 5 kids from 3 baby mommas.  Another friend is doing well in a small house.  My coworker is broke but about to move in with her boyfriend and she plans to build a home in 5 years (it helps that her family owns the land already).  I make more than my best friend but he's also married to a RN.  They have a nice house and just had a daughter.  I live alone and am renting and my debts are a car payment and some credit card debt that I'm slowly getting out of.  I do live paycheck to paycheck as I have no savings, although I have a 401k at work and have been putting money into a Roth.  Me and my gf are planning to move in together in the spring either here or look into getting a home. When I hit retirement age, I think the 401k/Roth will be there as extra income because I'm a firm believer that overall our generation and younger's motto will be "lol retirement" and it'll simply be something to read about in history books.

Many more people suicide with guns then by anything else including drugs.  Guns kill way more efficiently then drugs.  Many suicides are on a whim with little time in contemplation and guns work great for that.  I do support the same type of gun regulations that other civilized nations have.  These countries are fine and they have a lot less gun deaths. You can still get a gun in these nations like Canada, Germany, and Japan.  It just isn't so damn easy and dangerous.  Especially the high capacity rapid fire shit.  That isn't for self defense or hunting!  I have a friend with mental illness, on meds, who attempted suicide before and he loves his guns.  Anyone who has ones a gun should understand they they are a lot more likely to shoot themselves or an innocent person then they are to shoot a bad guy in self defense.  A lot of people just kill themselves on a whim because it's easy.  Cops and military have high rates of suicides cause they often have guns within easy reach.  The drivers of gun and opioid sales are the specific businesses and industries.  "Money is the root of all evil"

I would think a compulsion would be a motivation to do a thing on a momentary basis.  And addiction would be a motivation to do a thing repeatedly on a habitual basis.  Repetition would be the distinguishing difference, I think.

I agree with this sentiment if your family consists of stable, mentally healthy and kind people. But, for some of us, gifts are not a gift of kindness but they come with strings attached. In this case, the best option is to (kindly but firmly) refuse the gift.

You're right, it's not the same thing. One person is actually committing acts of violence and the other isnt.   But seriously, your arguement might make a little more sense if the following was true: "Anti fascists only go after fascists" but it isnt. There have been so many people attacked that are not neo-nazis, they are simply right wingers.

I liked their twin shtick it was cute and it reminded me of Ram and Rem. [Nice sword](https://i.imgur.com/Ib4qaQf.png).   [](#disbelief)  That was very shocking I didn‚Äôt expect the fight to go so bad. Are they dead now, it seems like parts were recovered (how much is needed anyways). Either way Bort was really damn cool that was a huge jump and she just demolished the lunarians.

It's less a perjury trap, and more how you prove perjury when someone is a notorious liar. Ask him the questions in written form before he knows what to lie about, and then use those written answers against him when he invariably lies later when more damning facts come out.
I wasn‚Äôt bashing you or anything I was just asking if I understood you right. I didn‚Äôt know if you became a Liquid fan or if you‚Äôre just supporting them for this event.  No need to be so defensive lol.
Very unpopular opinion it seems. I loved this show too and yet it gets alot of expected, superficial hate thrown it's way.   I just wish I could see the 10th episode, they basically erased it from every platform the rest of the show streams on. Intensely frustrating given how episode 9 ends. 
Ok. I thought I was being vague enough by not listing title names.

We will only talk about scouting here so make sure your own licenses and hunters ed is taken care of.  First.   \-Pick your species, for ease we will talk about deer in general   \-figure out where it is legal to hunt for your species   \-Make sure you know what rules you will need to follow and write it down on a small cheat sheet or wallet card   \-Things like how many antler point minimum, what counts as antlers, does it even need antlers etc.  \-Find the area you would like to hunt on google maps, for now just grab any piece of legal land you can use and scout it.   \-Find that same area on [Windy.com](https://Windy.com) Learn to use that website via the different tools and layers to find the wind direction and what time the wind will be blowing etc.   \-Once you find a couple spots you like, print out a few screen shots of where you want to go and circle your spots you want to check.   \-Take all your gear for sitting in a spot and wear the required amount of hunters orange.  Bring two articles of hunters orange if they are cheap, wear one and hand the other above or around your spot your going to sit.   \-Your going to pretend your hunting but don't bring your rifle or bow etc, just bring a pistol for self defense.   \-now here is the scouting part.  Look around the area for active trails that you think might be deer.  Your looking for foot prints and scat.   The wetter the scatter means it was recent, more dried etc means older.  Your looking for wet scat.   The more scat in the area means the closer to the bed site your getting, try to stay out of these areas so they still feel safe.   \-Once you find a suitable trail system, find a spot you think you would like to sit as if you were hunting.  Or place trail cams in the directions you think it will take proper pictures/video. (reminder that trail cams can be stolen)   \-Sit quietly and listen and watch, also pull out your map and start taking down any notes and trying to draw trails etc.  You can sit this one spot all day, or move on and find more trails and make them down.  This is where game cams are wanted so you can watch multiple spots at once and over a few days.   \-Lets assume you see the deer that you want you and its legal etc. mark the time you saw it and the day and just watch what it does until it leaves.    You have now successfully scouted the area and found your target.  Try for the game cams as your in and out with out leaving much of a scent.  Also if you found the deer you want, don't keep coming back, wait till the season opens up and then go back to the spot ready to take him.  I am sure I missed something.  Always ask questions, I will try to help.  
So you already had the test.... damn man that sucks if it was me I‚Äôd leave
Holy shit, out of the few board games I own, this is one of them. Mostly because of my childhood interest in Formula 1 (Having the Monaco GP circuit on a board game was the coolest thing). I haven't even thought about this game for over 14-15 years. The rules were definitely the one part I didn't follow when "playing" this, mostly due to not being good at reading English. Fun seeing it played for the first time with actual rules.
I'm impressed.  My memory is hazy, I just know I was extremely addicted and loved it.  I hope you remember.  I'm not sure if it was newgrounds or addictinggames or something else.
Enjoy life more, man. You seem like a very unhappy person.

See I feel totally opposite about the controls.  The way your character controls makes it feel as though he is constantly on roller skates.  Despite this I‚Äôm not saying ac odyssey is a bad game by any means.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs amazing but it‚Äôs good, and it‚Äôs fun.  Just feels jankey in a lot of ways.  It doesn‚Äôt feel like you have smooth and fluid controlling of your character. Take horizon zero dawn or mgsv for example and how it felt as though you had full and smooth controlling of your character compared to ac odyssey.  The most jarring thing coming from red dead are the animations though.  When talking to people especially.  They move like a robot trying to simulate how a human would move.  And poorly at that.

What a bland yet also tacky name. It means absolutely nothing. What the hell are they thinking?  Earlier I joked that they should use one of Stroll‚Äôs brands in a similar way to how Red Bull‚Äôs owner uses Red Bull as his teams‚Äô names.  Basically, I had that idea because this season Stroll already brought one of his major fashion brands, Hilfiger, to Mercedes.   Michael Kors, the fashion brand that made rose-gold the cultural icon it is today, is the Stroll-related brand I chose. Yeah it‚Äôs tacky to nerds like us here on /r/f1 but the brand itself has a lot of fans. Crucially, Kors fans are almost exclusively not F1 fans yet they are religiously fans of the Kors brand. If Kors was the brand under which the team was established, then those fans would suddenly start caring about F1, which would be great, more fans for the sport is good for us all. And the ‚Äòglamour‚Äô of F1 could add to that brand‚Äôs cache, as well as boosting F1‚Äôs own glam-status in the minds of younger women. as the team name because, despite that brand‚Äôs literally tacky image, at least they‚Äôd do some good for the sport by attracting the interest of Kors-fans and Kors-mockers alike. Pretty much all young women in the western world appear to be firmly ensconced in either of those camps, which means that that brand is gold in terms of spreading the message across that young female demographic, it‚Äôs well known and out there and generates buzz and conversation. And oddly for a fashion brand which has a tacky image, even Kors-mockers don‚Äôt hate the brand perse, it‚Äôs more of a gentle joshing kind of vibe. So there‚Äôs be little to no genuine bad press, unlike a lot of F1 associated brands such as alcohol, oil companies and even Red Bull &amp; Monster who have been at the center of recent parental concerns over how much sugar and stimulants is appropriate to allow for children. With Kors, there is none of that bad press, they just sell shiny bags and watches to young fashion-conscious girls.  Could have been a total win-win for both Strol and Liberty.   Liberty have missed a huge open goal by not seeing this opportunity and making some sort of approach to Stroll to get Kors, or one of his other female-focused fashion brands involved in a major way. More fans is always a good thing.   Racing Point as a brand name is as random and buzzless of a team name as it gets. Still though, hoe great is it that Force India has been saved and its future preserved? For that, we‚Äôll all be extremely grateful for this move, whatever the name ends up being.

It's psychological horror. The sex in it is just a plus, not meant to be erotic but as another way for the characters to degrade and manipulate each other. That being said if you feel uncomfortable, then don't force yourself to read it just because is trendy. Check  later once its over and see if you can stomach how it ended (base on people's reviews and reactions)

Yeah truth be told this doesn‚Äôt sound like a super unique game idea. This might be cooler as a show or movie, showing how women had to go from innocent housewives to zombie killing machines, and the psychological toll it has on them.   The reason I don‚Äôt think it would work as a game is because it‚Äôd make no sense for women in the 50s to all of a sudden become zombie killing badasses. It would be a slow, probably traumatizing experience. Unless you wanted the game to just be insanely over the top and have women in heels and dresses see an upcoming apocalypse and decided to load their shotgun with a smile on their face, but we already have loads of other games just like that.   It could still be fun though

I would agree with that but you are forgetting that GTAV was profitable since day 2 or 3 of it release. Then they released online and saw the money mine they had on their hands and said fuck it to SP dlc. I'm 99% sure they will do the same thing here. That's what really annoys me.

Me too.
Both have their place. As far as ARs go there isn‚Äôt a reason for me to spend 3k for a HK416 when my DI MP15 will always outperform me as a shooter. And I think that applies to 90% of civilian shooters as well. But piston systems have been well utilized in some pretty prolific weapons of their own. Most famously the AK. Having said that I‚Äôd argue most average gun owners couldn‚Äôt tell you a reason why a piston vs. a direct impingement may be better or worse because they wouldn‚Äôt know either.   Personally, as far as what I do with my AR, direct impingement is my preference as the only real draw back for me is weapon maintenance. 
I wouldn‚Äôt beat yourself up too much about no control for one class! I‚Äôd try subbing a few more times and see if you any of the others are better. I m going for secondary Ed and I sub a lot, and some classes I simply just don‚Äôt have control, it‚Äôs  hard when you‚Äôre not the one who set up the classroom management and set the rules for the kids!

I‚Äôve eaten from there probably 10 times this year.  It‚Äôs still pretty good. Probably depends on which dishes you get though.
Those words can sometimes be subtle (or not so subtle depending on opinion) signals of rejection.   Come to meet the other person, but don't hold out too much hope. 
For what it‚Äôs worth, I take 0.5mg of haloperidol every day, a different kind of anti psychotic. That‚Äôs a low dose. It helps with my anxiety, mood, impulsiveness and obsessive thinking.  I tripped for the first time in a long time recently and wasn‚Äôt sure how the haloperidol would effect things. I look 250ug and tripped pretty good. I was really high but didn‚Äôt have a ton of clear visuals. Thinking back to the past, it felt more like 200 or maybe 175, at least on my mental scale.   Which is fine by me. My trip still felt like an awesome acid experience. I‚Äôll take 300 next time to amp it up a little bit. Maybe that will feel more like what I expect from 250.   Maybe haloperidol is less disruptive to tripping than risperidone. Could be an alternative medication to consider. I think risperidoneis an atypical anti psychotic which I guess makes it closer to abilify, which I know is a stronger medication.   I‚Äôve been on and off a lot of medications in my life for better or worse, dealing with issues like depression and anxiety and a little craziness. Having tested a variety of things, I‚Äôm a big fan of anti psychotics as compared to any other type mood affecting medication. The side effects aren‚Äôt bad, they can be effective, and you can trip on some of them if you are on a low dose.  Tripping on lithium can be deadly, on the other hand. And tripping on SSRIs isn‚Äôt great and is not healthy either.   Btw I‚Äôm really careful with my approach to tripping given that I have anxiety issues and whatnot. A little risk but I love the experience.
I mean, this is the same story which laughed off rape potions... What do you expect?
Power doesn't originate from the consent of the governed, power grows out of the barrel of a gun, and the government has a lot more guns than anyone else. On paper, we have rights, but in practice they can do anything we can't force them not to do.

Sakazuki is Akainu's real name, Akainu is just his nickname. Sakazuki is also the act of drinking sake cups to pledge loyalty with each other. ASB did the Sakazuki ritual to pledge their brotherhood with each other. The newspaper said Marine Admiral Sakazuki killed Ace, which triggered Sabo's memories. Recollection of lost memories from amnesia usually stems from a person witnessing something or reading something that significantly correlates with those memories.

Understandable decision from the community.  I understand these unpopular views should not be part of the community.  Young children watch speedruns and get into the hobby by our popular runners.   May I also propose that maybe all speedruns should be family friendly?  We should continue to set a good example to other communities out there.  Going all family friendly would prevent our youth from potentially gaining these bad views.  No swearing, drugs use, smoking, etc in streams.  Maybe just make live-streams gameplay only and no facecam so it‚Äôs really about the games.  Just throwing ideas out to maybe better the community!  I just don‚Äôt want my children to start swearing or smoking because their favorite speedrunner does it.  There are a number of speed runners throwing down f-bombs and smoking on stream.  I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a good idea that our children are easily exposed to that.
What was your discussion about? Some context may help.  The soft sciences that I know of often contain unfounded view points. Those view points drive the studies (which contain only a hand full of samples) to a point that is the same as what they started with. The Null Hypothesis isn't checked against the data correctly, its not written properly, they say there wasn't a significant difference but there WAS a difference so here is why etc. No statistically significant difference is no difference.  But yes, context/discussion would be great to see.

Arrangement view\*  Not really sure what you mean by play a live set in the arrangement view (Arrangement view goes from left to right, while session view is what lets you play with all the clips).  If you have them backwards, and you want to record the live stuff you do in session view, then yes, you can. If you hit the global record button at the top of ableton while you're playing in session view, it will record everything into the arrangement view for you to go back to and edit. When you're done, just export the audio.  If you want to directly record everything you do into a single track, set up an audio channel, and set its input to "resampling", as this will record everything going through your master channel. With resampling though, what you hear is what you get, so if you start randomly muting tracks, those mutes will be recorded into your audio file.

I think you should tell him what his fried said, honestly you were all drunk and it just came out very badly and it hurt you. He doesn't really know you and quite honestly even if he's your bf's best friend he doesn't necessarily know everything about their relationship and how things ended. Although this 'one that got away' thing might be a larger issue, you should see what your bf has to say about all that. The window hasn't closed so long as it's still an issue for you. 
Congrats! Take some time to relax for self-care, especially if you won't have time off between graduation and starting work.

It's good to have young fresh energy in a workplace, but please remember you will be the most novice person there, unless you have significant work experience from before grad school.

I worked at Hollywood Video in 2000-01. Whenever we got a home video returned on accident we watched it hoping for porn.   Once we got one turned it on, and it was. Some guy and his wife on the couch they both kept their socks on(don't know why I remember that). So we watch the view and it goes to their kids opening Xmas gifts.  So they taped over their kids opening Xmas gifts to record themselves having sex.  
Australia made 469/5 with two centurions retiring. Took a relatively sizeable first innings lead despite declaring 5 down and not having any of their first choice three pacers play. All that was against a team consisting of India's best First Class cricketers not in the Test side (some of them have gone on to break into the side). We're getting smashed around by literal park cricketers here. Bhuvi and Kuldeep won't play the 1st Test anyway. Not sure what your parallel is.

I would much prefer Bauer, both because I love his personality and because I think he's the better pitcher of the two. Kluber may have the more dominant stuff for now, but he's getting older whereas Bauer has flashed true ace potential and has a lot of time to grow.   Tbh I don't really see the point in us trading for a SP anyways though. Kershaw/Buehler/Urias/Hill/Ryu/Maeda/Stripling/Wood are a lot already, and that's not including any of our prospects. Why bother bringing in Bauer? Are we gonna move Hill or Ryu or Urias to the pen? Unless we think Urias won't be ready to go next season we really don't need another starter.

You'd be surprised. Plans start at $400/month by the time you are 40, and insurance costs keep going up year after year. Within a decade, I'm sure it'll cost 1k a month or more for a crappy bronze plan for a 50 year old male.   I already know people in their 50s and early 60s who are paying $1600/month for garbage insurance with no subsidies. 
Oh I think the offender is a "little shit".  I like the idea of him being banned.  Banning him is justified.  What I am against however is Bethesda taking people's money and "permanently" banning people.  He should be banned for several months and be allowed to resume as a rehabilitated player.  For example in 10 years he's still not going to be able to play despite buying the game.  So I am only against the idea of a permanent ban.  It's not justified.  Especially on a single incident.
