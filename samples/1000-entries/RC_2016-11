Someone's already done「Paper Mario」, so I guess I'll do「Thousand-Year Door」.  This stand manifests itself as an audience of random people that only the user can see. By successfully appealing to this audience, the user becomes stronger relative to how much the audience favors them.  However, this stand has a fatal flaw- though enemies can't see the audience, the audience is fully aware of and reacts to them. Should the enemy find a way to appeal to「Thousand-Year Door」's audience (or simply be cool enough to appeal naturally) and become the favorite, the audience will shun the user, decreasing their power and even inciting things to be thrown at them.

You only need to pay rent for the time you're actually living there.

&gt;And, rather than have parents simply sit down, have a rational discussion about what's best for the student, and come to a reasonable decision, that they would prefer that every disagreement should be resolved with a lawsuit.  Some schools in order to save money have adopted a policy of no, until you know they wont give up. Wasting everyone time so they can do as little as possible. The power is in the hands of the schools at this point. The ability to sue would give some leverage to parents. Mind you lawsuits are still expensive, and often a waste of time. I'm all for schools losing some of their power in the situation.

I don't want this thread to become about arguing over whether he did it on purpose or not, because only Derek and Valve know for sure, Valve isn't going to break confidentiality over petty drama, and we can't trust Derek to tell the truth, so the gulf for spiteful speculation is very wide. However, having said that, it's notable that Derek didn't give a when in that tweet; [still not back on Steam.](https://archive.is/piGhm) It's up to him to prove it.

Even though I'm happy this dump closed, it's kinda sad that it stayed open this long.

They're correct though, they did not actively use a tracker to find that Snorlax. You even said it yourself, they benefited from overhearing the information, which makes a small but significant difference.  That situation with the Snorlax is like overhearing an answer during an exam, what do you do? Do you put a wrong answer on purpose because you "weren't supposed" to hear the right one, or do you make the best of it and get some free points? Imo, you'd be a fool not to take advantage of it, even if that wasn't what you initially intended to do

Ever since I tried to read The Hobbit, I've thought that Tolkien's style of storytelling was terrible. I tried a second time with The Two Towers, and despite getting a quarter of the way through before giving up, my opinion remained unchanged. Then I discovered Moorcock's Eternal Champion series- *The Black Sword Saga*- and found my preferred fantasy writer. Given his lack of films, I would consider him an underdog in a once underrepresented genre.  Do you have a favorite (or top 10, even) writer who you would consider an underdog?  Second question, if I may: If you're familiar with the Eternal Champion trope, do you have any characters in your books you would consider to be a faucet of it?
That seems a rather small act, tbh.

Oh no doubt.  Even when I have very strong assassins I'm teamed up with I'll still often selfishly take the triple snare.  With the homing bounce and bleed it's absurd, but I feel buffing the drones is still overall more beneficial to the team. Very much depends on your teammates though. If you're solo queue and can't trust anyone you're with then there's no question, triple bola ALL DAY.

The philosophical discussion is on *at most* two topics. It's not like Templars and Assassins are ranging their debates from religion to unrelated topics like linguistics or epistemology.  I was okay with AC1 having this debate and then skipping to basically AC3 which rehashes it in the context of the American Revolution. But if every game released consecutively has to deal with a region of people and whether they have the right to govern themselves without influence, subtle or overt because one group thought those people were selfish bastards and the others thought otherwise, than it would get very stale very quickly.  If they found other subjects to have philosophical differences over, i'd be happy to see those in games, but lets not kid ourselves, the nature of the fundamental difference between Templars and Assassins haven't changed since AC1.

That isn't the same thing. Height can give you a functional advantage. It comes down to how well you can play. Lots of shorter people have made it in the NBA, and they are often some of the most popular players.   Ballet enforces standards for dancer's bodies for purely aesthetic reasons. No matter how good you are at dancing, most companies won't hire you unless you conform to a very strict body type. We are not talking about a body type that you would naturally get from dancing as a profession.  You don't have to be against ballet(as I am not) to acknowledge that this is quite a bit different than what you are talking about.

Lol k. It's all right there and you won't disavow. This shows the true character of a right winger.

Lol projection. Why is it always the right wingers doing this? All of the right wingers do it, Trump comes out says he got the best temperament and Hillary's is the worst ever, says nobody treats women with more respect than him, etc. 
I'd say it's worth giving another try. I enjoyed it from the start but season one definitely picks up more as it goes on a little more. The characters all become a little more rounded and like P&amp;R, B99 allows its characters to have full personal lives and relationships as it goes along. After Samberg and Braughter's characters stop being quite as at odds it also settles into a better dynamic IMO. Samberg also gets a little more comfortable in the role and leans on "goofy" a bit less.   It's the only show left that feels like a successor of the P&amp;R, Community, 30 Rock etc lineup from back in the day - it's a comforting thing to watch weekly, has a long season and a high joke per episode ratio. The ensemble is also really great and the show has fun giving them against-type personality details and such.   I'd really say give it another shot, watch a bit longer into the season. It's not quite as sentimental as P&amp;R and the police setting confines storylines more, but it's a very reliable comedy with a similar sense of humor.

Who gets the post-show for survivor series?
Yep, I use them in my own game :)  I don't know exactly how familiar you are with the motion planning functions so I'll start from scratch. Sorry if you already know this, bear with me!  I usually have a "motion control" object, and put the grid code in that. So, my planning object (oMotion) has the following create code:    //start our motion planning grid. Note we use the room width and height   //to calculate how many cells we need, based off the cell size.   //Probably a good idea to use a constant for cell size but for this example   //I'm cheating   grid = mp_grid_create(0, 0, room_width div 32, room_height div 32, 32, 32);      //add the "unallowed" squares to the grid; To do this I use wall objects.   //You can use other objects, or use the other mp_grid_add functions to manually specify   mp_grid_add_instances(grid, oWall, 0);  Next, in your boomerang object (let's call it oBoomerang), initialize a path in the create event:   path = path_add();  To use the A* algorithm, in your oBoomerang object, do the following in whatever event it is that you need the path:   path_set = mp_grid_path(oMotion.grid, path, x, y, oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, 1);  This generates the path and assigns it to the path variable we created in the create event. To actually then start the boomerang on the path we have to use the path_start function:   //have to make sure the path generation didn't fail!  //note that above I assigned the returned path generation value to  //path_set. This will be true if the algorithm found a path and false otherwise  if(path_set)  {   path_start(path, 5, path_action_stop, 0);  }  else  {   show_debug_message("Couldn't calculate path");   //code to try path generation again/calculate alternate movement/destroy boomerang etc  }  Here is where I expect you have gotten to before. However the "path" variable holds a standard path as per any other path you set in the game, and the path functions can be called on it.  So in your question above, how do you find the nearest node to the player, I would create a new function like the following:   ///path_get_nearest_point(x, y)    //find the number of "nodes" - GMS calls them points, in the path  var number = path_get_number(path);    var point;  var distance = 10000;  var curr_dist;    //make sure the path has at least 1 point!  if(number &lt; 1)  {   return -1;  }  //loop through the path points and return the one closest to player  for(var i = 0; i &lt; number; i++)  {   //find the distance to the player   curr_dist = point_distance(argument0, argument1, path_get_point_x(path, i), path_get_point_y(path, i));      //check to see if it's closer than our previously stored closest point   if(curr_dist &lt; distance)   {    distance = curr_dist;    point = i;   }  }  You can then use this in your boomerang object:   var nearest = path_get_nearest_point(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y);  Now you have the id of the point, you can do whatever you want to it, for example delete the point:   path_delete_point(path, nearest);  Or if you want to delete all points past this one too you can use the loop again:    for(var i = nearest; i &lt; path_get_number(path); i++)  {   path_delete_point(path, i);  }  Lastly, if your boomerang object has already started along the path when you change the path, you may find you need to stop the movement, make the changes and restart again. You may also need to manually place the boomerang in the right position along the remodified path. I'll leave that to you to play around with depending on the result.  If you are still having problems, send me your most recent attempts and exactly what you're trying to achieve with them and I'll have a look at the game file.

Acting like teenagers, but instead they're adults and have no excuse like lacking life-experience. Good for you for hitting up that other guy haha.

Why, how does it affect you at all, it makes it so that when there is a burn you can use one of your burn primaries. if they wanted to make it so people used regular kinetic weapons on those specific activities then make a kinetic burn. Not having elemental primaries in those makes it so your primary weapon is barely ever used.

What platform are you looking for? Any interest in a 16" Titan Defense TD415 (HK 416 clone) upper? Unfired as yet. Was scouting around to replicate the build someone here on Reddit (or was it AR15.com?) did where they built a non-HK 416.  For an 805 Bren, yeah, I can live with not having a 416. :D  Also in DFW (Richardson)  and have a number of other black rifles and duty/service type handguns as well.   Going to crash out right now, but PM or email me with trade options.   Also, any issues with non-CZ AR magazines like PMAGs or Hexmags? Do they lock/drop freely and feed properly? I haven't heard any horror stories, but I haven't researched the question, and need to get some shuteye before work @ midnight.  Thanks in advance!

Cool beans.   So, "why am I an atheist." I think the question can be answered in two different ways.   1) There is no proof of a god, save for what truth claims are made within individual religions. Most of these truth claims are verifiably false, or lack any substantial veracity.   2) Rather than looking at atheism as an identity, it's more accurate to look at it as a lack of an identity. No single god claim, especially one that involves a personal god (primarily the Abrahamic religions), remains afloat when tested. They all sink. The only exception to this is the most extreme form of deism. I would say that a god that doesn't seem to exist by every metric, may as well not exist at all.

I'm not going to lie. I actually really like the love story between Natasha and Bruce in *Age of Ultron.*  People say that it comes out of nowhere, but I never thought that. And I don't think it weakens the movie.  It was actually one of my favorite parts. Natasha is haunted by her past sins. She was a Soviet assassin, trained since adolescence to kill and torture and uphold a horrific regime. Bruce fights every day to keep the Hulk, a creature he doesn't understand, the monster inside him, at bay.   They're two broken people: Natasha was never "normal," and Bruce can never be "normal" again.   Contrast them to Hawkeye, who can do his Avengers missions and then come home to his little farm, with his wife and his kids.   Furthermore, look at the other Avengers.   One of Steve Roger's most defining characteristics is his determination to do the right thing. But second to this is his absolute conviction in free will. He chose to join the Army. He volunteered for the Super Solider Program. Everything he's done, is something he's chosen to do.  Similarly, Tony Stark chose to make amends for his past misdeeds. But unlike Natasha, his misdeeds were a bit more public, and had logical solutions. His weapons were being smuggled into the wrong hands? He cancels the program, and begins to build new clean energy programs instead. And in theory, Tony (if he wasn't Tony) could retire, for want of a better word.   Thor's a different being entirely, so he doesn't really apply here--but free will is still part of his character.  But Natasha and Bruce didn't have a choice in what they became.   They fell in love, because it's one of the only things they can choose. And their devotion, though understated on-screen, is all the more fragile, and they are all the more desperate to cling to it.

Arachnophobia, pre-rework. That's basically the only one that has ever been interesting.  The thing about the MOTD is that the vast majority of them are just "play less than your full god pool, perhaps without mana or with increased CDR," which is not a drastically different gameplay experience than just playing regular Smite. There's no real reason to play them.  The good MOTD's are the ones that alter playstyles, which is why a lot of the only-one-assassin-or-guardian ones are particularly fun, since some number of you have to build and play significantly differently, due to the complete lack of defense or offense normally present in those characters.  The only recent MOTD that has approached this was the all-Bastet arena with max CDR, wherein you had to account for an extra 15 cats at basically all times. But once you realized that the massive CDR meant you could basically just jump in place repeatedly to kill all the cats, even that got stupidly lame.  While I don't like modes like Omnipotence which offer endgame builds right out of the gate, I'm fine with those existing, because a lot of people enjoy them. Rotating that mechanism through the various maps is about the best the MOTD has to offer, really, but I still wouldn't play any of them.

Jesus. This is so spot on. So many people come to the store I work at and go through the lengthy "I shop here all the time to keep money in local businesses, I know the stores owner, so can I get a discount?." I don't care how often you shop there or who you know, our margins aren't high, which is why the employees aren't paid much in the first place, so no, you may not have a discount.   I can't count the number of people that think that just because it's a mom and pop store, they can haggle prices. It's not a flea market, genius.   And, last but certainly not least (as I could go on all day), if I hear one more person ask to have a discount because it's cheaper on Amazon, I'm going to flip a lid. It's cheaper because we have to order from a warehouse, that ordered from another warehouse and all of us pay shipping on that. Add that to the cost of the product and it's no wonder it's more expensive than Amazon. So, if you think you can get it on Amazon cheaper, then order it. I'll be damned if my paycheck keeps dwindling because you're too cheap to support a local business even after boasting that you're just soooo loyal to it.   Retail makes you really hate people and sorry for the rant.   Source: Work in retail.

I think the only way to make it work is to put a humours spin on it. I mean there would be some fans of the one that crushed your hopes and dreams everytime but for broad appeal making the each failure humours is some way would dull the pain to the reader.  Also I think this works better in an ebook or perhaps as a webpage. Some format where you don't know how many pages are left in the story as it would clue you in to which protagonist was the one that lives. You can get the ebook page number but its not as obvious as a physical book. A special webpage where you only had next page as an option would work best.  **Edit:** oh I just had a good idea, make every iteration a different author.   That is each story takes place in the same world with the same big bad thing to stop. But other then some set pieces and general worldbuilding each story will be very unique. So it would be more an anthology.  The next level of world building is that each story happens chronologically so that story 5 could stumble upon story 2 protagonist's corpse.  Then have the final author write the one where the protagonists succeeds. That could be fun anthology work that would showcase different author styles while encouraging readers to keep buying the next installment.   If the protagonists succeeds then a new story starts in a new world. That way any story can end in failure or success and they would all be different enough so they don't seem repetitive.

Esa fracesita de que si votan lo que yo es el triunfo de la democracia y si no es la conspiración la vengo leyendo en la red  hace un tiempo. Se ve que a muchos les gusta que les den frases rimbombantes para repetirlas allí donde creen que van causar alguna admiración.

Passengers are "multipoint to multipoint" service as opposed to cargo being "multipoint to point" (assuming you're servicing a single drop station like me). The network architecture would be significantly different without a lot of line crossing. I'd basically build an S-bahn type local network (probably a short loop) ending at a large feeder station in the largest town in the area I'm trying to serve. At that large station, passengers could transfer to intercity express trains. Or, something like that.  Using the train set I'm using, the intercity rail engines now that it's 2107 are almost twice as fast as the cargo engines I'm using (I picked the engine I did because it has good acceleration, so my priority triggers can be short, and they can handle tight corners without having to slow down, so my hubs can be more compact - though they top out at 147mph). The compromise of using the 147mph trains for the intercity services would be a bad one if they were to share track with the freight trains. Not making them give way to trains on the freight backbone would cause a jam on the backbone almost instantly, but in converse that would disrupt the passenger service. Express trains should also be a longer (8-12 tiles or so) and would slow down in the compact hubs that the 5-tile freight trains are using, which would also disrupt the freight trains. If I tried more frequent, shorter trains for intercity service, and made them give way to trains on the backbone, that wouldn't be very reliable and I might end up with a wave of several trains arriving at a passenger terminal at once, where the first 1-2 would fill up with passengers and the rest would end up departing rather empty.  So, I could build a passenger network in the same game if I wanted to, but by necessity it would basically have to be an entirely different network.
Buying a truck and employing massive, nation wide surveillance systems are two very different things.   An armored car is a one time deal, sure you need to fuel it but you don't need to fuel it every two hours. You don't need an ever increasing storage system.   Nice strawman, try harder.

A ver vamos de a poco..  De donde salen los 27 fps que decis? Que estas comparando? Lo que veo es i5 6600 170 fps contra i7 6700 190 (el 6500 no aparece pero estaria un par de frames abajo del 6600). Eso te da una diferencia de un poco mas del 10%.  Pero es irrelevante tener 170+ fps si no tenés un monitor para eso (lo cual dudo que alguien comprando una pc ya armada tenga). Cuando tenes juegos que apenas te llegan a 60fps la diferencia entre un i5 y un i7 se achica mucho más.

I get that Barristan thinks he's dead, but Barristan is just looking at burned bones. They could be any body's bones. Dany sets this up by saying "burnt bones mean nothing." I understand that the oil on Quentyn's whip caught fire, and that traveled to his body. Sure he could be badly burned. But, to suggest that he's dead is too presumptuous. Most people who get burned don't die. You can't just say that Quentyn's dead because he was on fire and someone presented some burnt bones. You need some proof to match Quentyn up with those bones.

Old electrician's trick.  Hot dogs are enough of a conductor to draw a reasonable amount of current, and enough of a resistor to get hot nice and fast.
There wasn't a plot. She literally sent classified information on a private nonsecure server. 
As the only married man in our group of friends and therefore notionally not a sexual predator or pervert, and generally not a jerk, I actually get to tag along with my wife on girls' nights because I'm non-threatening and just go with the flow.  They talk about dicks. Non-stop. How many dicks they've had, how much they are craving dick right now, biggest dick they've had, how big they like their dicks, the last dick they had, time until next expected dick, whether they could get dick right now. That guy's dick? What's it like? Could I get his dick? I'd like that guy's dick.  Once they've tired of dick conversation they discuss each others boobs. A couple of them have implants so how much was the surgery. Are you happy with the result? How do they feel? Can I feel them? (Sadly I get left out of that part, but I get to watch).  It's way better that guys nights, where everyone mainly talks about sports, politics, and craft beer. I enjoy a beer but I drink it, I don't really talk about it.
Absolutely agree that it needs to be a video. Otherwise he could just deny the hell out of it, and then it becomes a case of he said she said.
Is that a common reason or are you just guessing?  Also couldn't I just omit that I worked at the usps, if I end up in the private sector. Since I worked there for 30 days.

Pushing conspiracy theories in America has been Russia's thing for a while. It goes back at least as far as spreading rumors after  JFK was assassinated.

That´s a long time for just one scene, yes. Apparently we are getting a parade with a very large crowd too.
Whatever you want to call it, it was bullshit. 
I'm actually surprised the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil hasn't pushed the Cintiq to perform better. It's really shocking how much more responsive the iPad Pro is side by.
He was wary of it, even more when he described  the guy who received him as "murderer face". But he took his wife and kid with him so he wasn't *that* afraid I guess.
I disagree wholeheartedly. You may learn the general indications/risks for a whipple, but if you think that you will ever understand that procedure as well as the person performing them, or do as good a job staying up on that literature, or quoting specific risk statistics and modifying those based on the individual's anatomy, you are delusional. There are deep nuances to every field of medicine. You may have deep knowledge of the *physiology* of a Norwood or a B-T but that doesn't qualify you to have an informed surgical consent discussion with a pre-op Tet family. I also think you have a rather optimistic view of how much surgical knowledge most non-surgeons possess. I've been consulted by fellowship-trained stroke neurologists for surgical decompression of a person who's wide awake, eating breakfast, and isn't even hemplegic.

Oh hey you're the guy with the lizard on his beard!  Love your costumes :D
So I have a few questions about 敬語.  Firstly, why does 召し上がる seem to be the only word that you can keigo twice? お召し上がりになります seems very common, but おいっらっしゃいになります or お申しします are weird?  Second, how do I know what words to actually put in keigo? We say sollnissと申します and ドイツから参りました but not 趣味はビールを頂くことです. What words should I use keigo with?  And thirdly, what's up with the super keigo thing? I often hear ますので or まして even though every class I've ever visited told me you  have to use 普通体 in the sentence and only the last verb is conjugated. The only thing I can imagine is when the speaker intended to end the sentence there and already said ま。。。 and then just remembers he wanted to say more and just continues with すので or して. But I also found this: http://blog.livedoor.jp/s_izuha/archives/3654119.html  Which again comes down to my first and second question. When do I use which 敬語 level? I know when to use the three main levels (食べられる、お食べになる and 召し上がる) but between these forms there is so much stuff that can happen... even the difference between お食べになります and 召し上がる seems weird. Is the latter more formal because it's the keigo form or is the first one more formal because it's ます? And then of course Japanese people themselfs also can't use keigo ...  Such a weird language.

I did. Style over substance but it had a charm to it. I have to say Robocop 2 is a film I enjoyed and watched a lot. Guess what the studio did to Miller's script?

Honestly I would be perfectly okay with pushing the election back a month if it meant Hillary was in jail/wasn't running. I was going to vote trump either way, but I would have A LOT less anxiety about the election if it wasn't her...  I've never seen anything like this. And she almost got it away with it too if it wasn't for that meddling Pepe.

I'm really pissed off. There's only 2 sections for ECE 252. A reasonably timed day section and a Friday night class. The day section is more than half-way filled and I'm a sophomore and Oksana's night 232 is slowly but surely filling up. I'm bugging out over it.
That's enough Reddit for tonight, I live in the area that had the shortage last time, so I'm heading out to stock up. I learned my lesson last time.
Because light is much faster than what OP characters usually dodge, it's just as extreme to them like bullets are to us. The difference though is that OP characters can still dodge.  &gt;And many "light speed" characters get tagged by slow things like ALL THE TIME  Would you care to provide examples and scans? 
The simpsons thread on /r/AskReddit is leaking
Good to hear.
Why would that context matter? The student could have murdered another student and it still would be beyond fucked up for the teacher to say they can't wait for a muslim student to be deported. 
Something like a reverse brain drain, where the difference in salaries between bigger and smaller companies is so great that talent or certifications over x level will inevitably be siphoned off of potentially "disruptive" companies. Not exactly scientific I know, but it could end up being one of those factors with a surprisingly high percentage. 
Ayyyyy rofl
That's what I don't like about this whole situation, most people are just coming off sounding like they're looking for a reason to justify this guy getting shot. They said we don't have all the facts, which is true; but they are assuming that the fact we don't have will support their case, and that this guy deserved to get shot. We have some amount of proof that this guy was guilty of stealing cigarettes, a minor property crime, but we have no proof that he was guilty of any kind of violent assault that would warrant this kind of response.  I used to be very deeply involved in The Patriot militia movement back in the late 90s early 2000s, and threads like this remind me that there are many people out there just itching for a reason to shoot somebody.
You'll get the same answer in r/islam. Noone wants to behead homosexuals. You'll find less support for homosexual identities however but that's largely because interpretations do not allow for separate gender assignments and identities. This is why some countries like Iran encourage those who prefer the same gender as them to undergo gender reassignment. Any activity beyond this is considered sinful but there are no consensus prescriptions or punishments assigned to it.   For most of Islamic history, homosexuality has been treated as something that everyone knows happens and you joke about but considered unseemly but not something you punish (though there have been instances of it). In fact, homosexuality was explicitly decriminalized in the Tanzimat reforms of the ottoman empire - a move that was read as a defiant gesture against growing European influence (which was decidedly anti-homosexuality and a little uncomfortable with Islamic passe treatment of those engaged in these acts). It's only in the last century that such strong stances has been taken against homosexuality.

I don't think the dongle uses Bluetooth, I thought it was wi-fi direct of some sort, either way, I don't think they have made it work with the ds4

Reddit is major media outlet and has a tight leash on its public face, on its pet subs. It's not hard to believe why they would act against their best interests.
That's nigh on impossible, because fantasy worlds are written by real people in the real world. We can't help but put our politics into work, and there's no real reason we shouldn't. A world that in no way reflected the real world's politics would be bland and boring, because (in part) it's those reflections that make fantasy and fiction as a whole interesting.
I agree. Part of what made Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All was those interludes. 
IMO just play whoever you have the most fun playing. But to answer your question. I'd pick lb when playing against squishy all-in champs and ahri against melee and sustained damage champs.

great job again /u/onrv, thanks for your efforts
Sweet 
I would have to agree, however his angle to pursuit were a off.  He got lucky on the shoe sting tackle with Adams, which could have gone for some huge yardage if Adams kept his balance.  And the coverage on Nelson that setup the first TD was suspect.  Neal needs to get his eyes out of the backfield when playing an elite qb.  All in all I love the kid, but he had some growing pains agains Aaron Rodgers.  On to the next.  PS, Jones is the next Ray Lewis  PSS, Campbell had a wonderful open field tackle during a RB Screen!  Love the LB core.  
Well done good sir
If it's tanish I didn't like it as much as the white kind I HC before but it's still good
if I were you I would immediately have gone to the police and reported it stolen. at least he gave it back, but that's still fucked up. maybe ask r/legaladvice if there's anything you can do about it. 
I honestly think he just bought the blue guys separately. The guy likes the chicken knobs so he can turn them with his toes. He's a shoes off shredder. Best guitarist we've had yet and probably the best I've ever met. Thanks so much though! Means a lot. We're trying really hard to keep things fresh and not just put same old same old out into the world. Different scenarios and genres of musicians have done the trick so far. Thanks again though.
Haha that's amazing I never knew that. Marhaba my African brother 
It's hard when that happens. At least you know he's happy and can visit sometimes. Guessing he gets pretty excited when you turn up to visit

You can definitely get into any of them, while your EC's and GPA are somewhat below the average your ACT places you well above the 75th percentile for all the schools so I'd say it all comes down to those personal statements - good luck!

Thanks for the analysis. I was actually wondering if I choose the higher level magikarp or one XS/XL. Now I'll keep the highest one!

I try to it's just that I don't have the time to work, go to school, work out myself, do homework AND go on walks with my sister.  Also unfortunately no reasonable amount of walking will counter-act their terrible diets. They're eating all the time and there's so many unhealthy snacks in my house that it's hard to even find a healthy snack let alone want it.   I try to convince my dad to stop buying so many chips, candies, cookies and soda but he says "I'm not changing my eating habits just because you're on a health kick" (He's still calling it a kick 7 months later...)   I don't understand how he's the one who suggested it in the first place and now that I'm committed to it he acts like he's inconvenienced by it. I feel like I am the only one who was willing to sacrifice my favorite foods and drinks for the sake of my health :/ 
It depends how he made it. If he took one corner out and glued them together, then certain sides can't turn. For example, if he took the corner out of the 3x3, and the 4x4 is glued to the F D piece, he won't be able to make L moves on the 3x3. Unless I'm wrong and there's a different way to make it, in which case please correct me. Either way, cool looking mod.
As much as I despise Trump, as long as he followed regulations here, he was a private citizen doing foreign business. I'm not sure how much he did wrong in this case.

How? Are you just assuming that Lebron would be stuck on a trash West team? If he went to any upper level west team that immediately upsets the balance in the west and the situation basically becomes the same as it is in the East. The only way he would have no titles is if somehow for the sake of argument he ended up on the worst West team and never signed elsewhere in the West. This narrative is so tired and played out.

If she had a yahoo email account, I am fairly sure email accounts on yahoo have security questions to answer in order to gain access into the email account. Since you've already mentioned that she used her computer to set up her email account, I am thinking a keylogger or a RAT is on that computer, both of those would be able to obtain all the information necessary to hack the account, including the answers to the security questions if they were in place.

I'll have to take a picture of the reward bar before I play a game, hope that the opponent forfeits / DCs and then take another picture. I'll forget.  Edit: rather, i have to take a picture of a game where i won without DC / forfeit and then take a picture of the bar, the next game and take a picture then if the opponent DCs / Forfeits.  I can't be arsed to do that. Hell, i'm not sure if i'm 100% right any more, though i have a good feeling i am.

Lads stated they demonstrated that dragonglass AND fire can kill them. They would take dragonglass with them whn they go on their wight hunt, and no doubt use it and discover it probably shatters wights as well.  They don't have 10000 men like the mountain do they?

I just saw a few articles posted about an hour ago on this subreddit claiming that the White House says that they don't believe Comey had any ill intent in Clinton email investigation.  Now this is saying that the White House questions his intentions.  So which is it, does the White House question Comey's intentions or not?

&gt; A lot of kids like to dress up. Most of them just grow out of it.  I remember being a kid and playing dressup. I even wore a skirt when I was a little boy, because I liked the skirt and my alternative parents supported me wearing whatever the damn hell I wanted. I had long hair too. I never felt I was a girl though, and never took offense to wearing boy clothes. And I definitely never wanted to cut off my penis or asked my mom when hers fell off.

I worked for a medical publisher and we did the whole pay to be published. To me it feels like a scam but some of those doctors were so desperate to be published in an established journal. One thing i noticed was often articles would cover the same material. You may have done the research but it is likely already been done. Whether they knew this or not I am not sure. 
Nink is okay in zone coverage but he's way to slow now to be consistent in man coverage. I do agree though on short drops, especially if they are disguised well he is pretty decent.  He's more of a 3-4 OLB anyways and we aren't playing much 3-4 anymore.

&gt; This causes the whiskey to expand and contract into the charred wood. picking up more color and flavor. This is part of the reason so much bourbon comes from Kentucky; the water comes up through limestone, picking up a lot of mineral content.  Huh?  What does limestone water have to do with expanding and contracting wood?  What a sloppy fucking "article" that isn't even correct (if 8 sentences can be called an "article").  &gt; And the barrels themselves are not stored in climate controlled warehouses - they are stored in buildings called rickhouses  Are you sure that there's not a single whiskey in the world that's aged in climate-controlled warehouses?  Because you're wrong.  &gt; Same thing for Scotch, only substitute barley for corn; but the keys are good water and weather extremes.  What is the same thing?  Islay has spring water bubbling up through limestone that's good for horse bones?  Scotland has the opposite of temperature extremes, so at the very least you're only 50% wrong.  If you're going to spam us with links to your articles, at least write them well.

Some non-root questions...  &gt; Is there a way to switch the order of the app and back buttons? (Coming from six years of Samsung)  Unclear  &gt; Is there a way to change the camera shortcut to two taps of home or back? My current case makes it pretty hard to hit the power button (which I like -- it keeps it from turning on accidentally in my bag).  Got this working with Nova Launcher by setting the home button to camera.  &gt; Can you change the assistant shortcut to something like two taps of home or back?  Doesn't seem like it; I tried to hook it up to a shortcut in Nova Launcher, but I can't find it in Applications.  &gt; I have a Fiio E17K; will it work with the pixel if I get a USB-C to micro-A cable?  I got a bunch of adapters and hodge-podged a cable between my Pixel XL and the E17K; it works fine.  Edit: Answering myself since I'm investigating.

It's not as restrictive as a complete cap like in the original proposition, and still allows people of any level to play together as long as they're prepared to be matched at or near the level of their highest player. If they're not, then casual seems like the perfect place for them.  And from my experience, Plats can easily steamroll Golds, and Golds can easily steamroll Silvers. There are pretty big leaps from any rank to another, splitting up Diamond only makes things more competitive the the very top.

From the globe and mail article:  &gt;A chorus of urban planners and environmentalists call that idea [that developers are running out of land] absurd, and point to statistics that suggest there is enough land already earmarked for development to last decades.

He said on a google hangout stream for Patreon that the best film of the year so far is Park Chan-wook's "The Handmaiden". He gave it a 9/10 on IMDb, but said he thinks it deserves a 10/10, and that he is going to watch it a second watch, which will higher his rating. Other than that, I think it is possible he could give a 10 for ELLE, Silence, It's Only the End of the World, or La La Land.

What are you planning on printing in? PLA works pretty well with HIPS as the dissolvable support. I really only use ABS anymore, so I haven't used this in a while. PLA and HIPS need similar bed temps, so this combo works pretty well.   I never took any pictures, but I made a bunch of covers for disposable razors that had a large opening on the front. Essentially a rectangular box that had an opening on 1 side. The top above the opening was completely unsupported. The part was too small for supports and was breaking while removing them. Switched to PLA with HIPS as support, then dissolved in limonene. Came out beautifully. 
I went to a comic festival at my city's downtown library and i was glad to have found two EV only parking spot.

I honestly would like to know the legal answer to the question this raises...  Can your employer require you to use a certain method of transportation to get to and from work? I mean what if they were hippies who required you bike or walk, even if it was a 20+ mile commute? If so, wouldn't that essentially put you on the clock and they'd be required to pay you for that time as it is now a job requirement? '

I agree. Part of what made Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets and ...And Justice For All was those interludes.
I think Spirited Away loses in terms of plot, but wins in terms of world building and immersiveness. It really sucks you into its world, and each set piece is so evocative. And since what I like best about Miyazaki films isn't what happens in them, but rather the moods they carry me through, Spirited Away is my favorite.

Yep, and that's a problem. I'm SERIOIUSLY hoping Kakao will see this and fix it at this point. 
I think what you're saying here counts as much for any genre as it does for moe/SoL shows. Do you think harem high school magic action show #23483 is taking any more risks than your typical CGDCT show with 4 girls engaging in x hobby? Most shows from any genre don't take risks, and from those that do you then also have to split them into those that utterly fail and those that succeed.  As with every other genre, the shows that typically end up as critically acclaimed, or "truly great" whatever that may mean, are the shows that stand out (for the better of it). They are the shows that really take the genre and elevate it and utilizes it fully. For moe/SoL  you have shows like Aria that throughout the course of 3 seasons and some OVAs tell an absolutely beautiful story about appreciating your life as time is inevitably moving forwards. It very much makes you feel strong emotions as you see the characters grow as people, both joy and sadness. You'll even get mad when you see people post shitty Akatsuki x Akari pictures or lewds of the Arias. You also have Kamichu that touches on how people live their lives and adapt to even big changes. Kokoro Library is about how a community can come together to preserve the things that once meant a great deal to them.  These types of shows have the characters front and center (by no means a unique aspect), and will tell you messages about life from a more down to earth angle. It's about the extraordinary in the ordinary, and it's something that resonates with me and many others.   I can't help but feel you are simply extrapolating your own experiences to the entire genre, making it out as though these are inherent in it. And I disagree that they are. We also seem to view what constitutes "risky" very differently, because I don't think a Key VN that taps into a big audience (proved by previous success of similar projects by the same publisher) and reuses many of the same things to create the same emotions, to be risky at all.

First i bought the EVGA GTX 1080 SC but this card failed me after 2 months so i got an MSI GTX 1080 Gaming X in exchange and im pretty happy with my choice. Luckily the MSI versions are much cheaper now than they were at release.  I know: A GTX 1080 is Overkill on 1080p but i want to have some power 3 years from now and Games like "The Division" are still pretty demanding, if you want to play with HBAO+ and PCSS

We bought an umbrella policy. The biggest asset you have to protect is likely going to be your potential future earnings. My decision to get an umbrella policy was based on this tipping point--too many assets to lose if I had to declare bankruptcy in the unlikely event I'm sued and my wages garnished to pay a million-dollar judgment for the remainder of my working days. My policy is not a huge cost, and because I'm risk-averse and slowly growing my assets, I decided to get one. Edited to add:  my personal liability is 300k with a million-dollar umbrella, I'm married in my early 30s.

I have a few friends with the vive and we've been playing it for a few months. The tech is cool but the software is definitely leaving early VR adopters wanting. There are fun pieces of software but not one single bit of it could be considered a "killer app."  Anyone that thinks VR is amazing and must-have right now is just trying to justify their early leap (and costly investment) into this sector. 
&gt;Since you can't dock at countries you are at war with, does that mean that England (If you take Scotland and Ireland) is untouchable?  You can land your troops if you're in a sea zone next to your land province. Select the boat, select the troops (top-right of the UI popup), then tell them where to land. That does take longer, though, and if there's troops waiting for you on the land, you get a significant combat malus (-3, IIRC, not affected by Maneuver), so it's *difficult* to invade navally... but not impossible. If you clear out the English fleet and then land men where their troops aren't prepared to defend, the British Isles can be yours. That said, you're working on a disadvantage, since the Isles are protected by a powerful navy and the need to land troops... of course, that's why the Brits stayed so safe from foreign aggression historically.  &gt;I am losing a war, I give them 2 claims of mine, and it is well over their war score, they say no. I change it to money, no. I even changed the claims they would get, but they still say no. How can I end the war?  Hover over the red X symbol to see why they're declining (the one that transforms into a checkmark when they will accept). Usually, they want some specific term from the war (for example, they will refuse to peace out unless they get exactly Danzig - plus more warscore). You can use the "Suggest Peace" button (or "Suggest Terms", something like that) to have the game automatically give you an offer the AI will accept.  &gt;I completely occupy a county in Ireland, killed all their army/ navy, I have 100 war score, but I can't annex them, or make them a vassal, why not?  Can you not select the province, or can you not peace out after selecting the province? If the former, hover over the province selection in the peace screen; if the latter, again, look at that big red X.  The most common reason for this is that it isn't in coring range, or that you don't have the diplo power to complete the peace.   It's also possible that you're not using a CB that lets you take provinces - for example, Humiliate Rival does not let you take provinces.  &gt;Why does France always feel the need to go to war with me, when ever I start a war?  Cause they're France. But really, this depends. Is it because of Aggressive Expansion? Were you Warned? Are you a heretic/heathen declaring on a member of the Catholic faith while France is Defender of the Faith?   For reference, you can see who will join, what stab effects, etc. you'll get before declaring war on the war screen (the one where you choose allies to call in).  Or, are they just being opportunistic and conquering your mainland provinces whenever you get into a war? If so, that's just France expanding in its natural way.  &gt;Country I am "friendly" with keeps fuckin with my trade, if I enforce trade, and block their ports, and go to war, then I have 15 other countries coming at me. What can I do, because every 20 days it seems to pop up.  What do you mean, "keeps fuckin with my trade"? That's pretty vague.  &gt;If I put out a settler, and it forms its colony, does it organically expand? or will I need more colonists? (Not sure, haven't gotten that far, look at #4 for reasoning)  If you have a colony on a far-away province, it will expand naturally. If you keep your Colonist there, it'll get new settlers much faster - but it'll keep growing as long as you control it + fund it enough in the budget screen. But yeah, Colonists make it far more efficient - and having more colonies than you have Colonists costs a very large amount of money (exponentially more).  &gt;I had sold Labourd to France, when playing as England. When the war of roses came, some rebels occupied Gascogne, however it was surrounded by France, and I couldn't get military access, so am I just stuck in the war of roses, because I can't unoccupy that provence?  Again, get some transports and land troops on that province.  &gt;How do I maximize my money made from trade?  If you want an essay, [read this (note that it continues in comments)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/5a6d3y/the_curiously_inscrutable_principles_of_trade/), but honestly, just follow these rules of thumb:  * identify your home node - it's the node your capital starts in (or you can move it with Res Publica, it's the "move trade port" option on the province menu that costs 100(?) dip, but it's generally not necessary - there are situations where it's nice to have, though) * use merchants to steer trade (transfer trade power) in nodes which flow into your home node * don't place a merchant in your home node, ever * take important trading provinces (Centers of Trade and Estuaries - look up the map mode) * the more nodes trade flows through, the more valuable it becomes, so steering through large chains can be helpful * all trade flows into Genoa, Venice, or the English Channel eventually, so those are the most valuable to control and - if you have a significant amount of power in them - have your home node in (and, thus, steer to) * collecting trade with merchants is very rarely worth it unless your empire spans multiple home nodes or "parallel" nodes (nodes that flow right past each other without interacting) * TRIAL AND ERROR - try things out with your merchants, see how it increases or decreases your trade income. I rarely rely on this anymore, but when I was learning trade it was very helpful

I recently heard that matchmaking only focuses 60 percent on connection and only 10 percent on regional.  (I am aware that is only 70 percent) but I am going to only use those two.  Before I go into regional.  60 percent....is way to low.  That means in a 6v6 only 7 of those players were connected based on connection.  In a 3v3 half of the players aren't connected by connection....  That on its own is ridiculous.  But let's look at that 10 percent.  Since only 10 percent is focused on match making you within your region.  You are being connected to people all over the world.  While that is cool that we are so interlocked and connected to play a great game for the purpose of PvP it is a travesty.  Connection doesn't matter if I am being connected to someone in europe.  No matter how fast the Internet works things aren't going to go right when you are being connected to people thousands of miles away that are connected to you by multiple servers.  If it was 60 percent connection and 30 percent regional that 60 percent wouldn't  seem so horrible but when I am being connected to people all over the world it truly is.  Side note on PvP.  T.o.O isn't SBMM it is CBMM but you are matched to people who have the same number of wins but it's on a P2p network and Host can play a major part in individual engagements.  Because of this, I do not support no revives.  While I think the current revive system is broken based on Immunity frames and the time it takes to revive people is far to fast, revives are important in a p2p style pvp.  (That's alot of p's) They are crucial because of Host.   How many people pull the trigger but fail to trade?  This could easily be due to Host.  This game deals with tenths of second and being Host can clearly be the deciding factor in the system already in place. Do we really want to add no revives in a system that can clearly favor one team simply because they are host? I will not go on but since this problem with Sbmm gets into connection I thought I would rant a bit.  
this is a really cute outfit.

Just happened to me with a coworker few days ago. He showed up to my soccer game uninvited...Talk about awkward.

Danke, dass du dir die Zeit nimmst dir meine Posts durchzulesen.   Ich stimme dir zu, dass man definitiv nüchtern am Steuer zu sein hat. Cannabis ist bei wöchenendlichen Konsum jedoch leider bereits schon über mehrere Tage nachweisbar, dank der restlichen Abbauprodukte - die jedoch wieder im Gegensatz zum aktiven Wirkstoff THC - keine Auswirkung auf dich mehr haben.    Ich habe gelesen, dass die Polizei momentan an einem Cannabis Test arbeitet, der wie der Alkoholtest funktioniert und den Konsum ca. 8h nachweisen kann. Dies wäre endlich eine faire Lösung, da somit sofort - anders als bei den bisherigen Methoden - festgestellt werden kann, ob der Fahrer nun wirklich aktiv mit THC berauscht ist, oder nicht.

Totally overwhelmed with the feedback this got, thanks for all your comments and info.  As a side note, something else I've been thinking about is how the air superiority T5 captain skill affects both lines. I'm assuming that once a IJN carrier gets it and faces up against a US carrier with the same skill the US ship is fucked. My logic behind this is due to IJN ships having more squadrons they get the most use out of the skill and so you might end up in a situation where your single squadron of 7 is getting eaten by 2 squadrons of 5.   How have people found this in practical terms?

It's dried leaf salvia, which is mainly smoked in a bowl or blunt. Youll probably feel more of a afterglow similar to the comedowns on extracts. You won't breakthrough or have any high akin to an extract. But should feel the mood lift/anti-depressant effects. Which feels "natural" instead of being "high" and feeling it.  Use a standard bowl or water pipe with a torch to get every bit of the salvidorium-A out of it. Blunts/joints would be more for someone who enjoys rolling them while only getting very little of the salvidorium-A since they don't burn hot enough.

Ok this is a very complex topic, but one can say WWI was more or less ignited because of Franz Ferdinand's assassination. However, the situation was highly volatile in the first place. The colonial powers had started an arms race due to clashes in Africa and the far East.  Originally, Germany and Russia were allies in a deal brokered by Bismarck, but in 1890 this was broken for a deal that united Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Russia in turn allied with France.   The Tangiers Crisis in 1905 helped strengthen the French-British relations, while souring diplomatic ties to Germany.  The second Moroccan crisis in 1914 helped fully cement the Franco-British pact and was strengthened by a secret naval agreement to protect the northern French coast from German interference in exchange for the French Navy protecting British interests in the Mediterranean.  Also, the Italio-Ottoman war in 1912 helped prove that no great power wished to support the Ottomans paving the way for war in the Balkan states. Austria-Hungary was itching for a war with Serbia because the Balkan Wars had left both the Ottomans and the Austro-Hungarians weakened and Russia and Serbia in an advantageous position.  Serbia wished to gain an Albanian port as part of the spoils of the first Balkan War and this created great tension in the region.  When Austrian and international pressure forced them to back away from this demand, they later joined with Greece and attacked Bulgaria.  The Bulgarian army fell easily when the Turks and Romania joined in.  So you had all of these interwoven situations all coming to a head with the assassination.  Germany backs Austria-Hungary with unconditional support.  Austria-Hungary sends Serbia a list of demands they can't possibly accept.  Serbia takes the advice of Russia to not give into the demands, while Germany publicly backs Austria-Hungary's official position.  Russia mobilizes 1.1m men, and the ball is rolling.  TL;DR:  Franz Ferdinand's death was the spark that ignited a powder keg mountain of deals and alliances.  EDIT:  I should also note that Franz Ferdinand himself was a big proponent of peace in the Balkans and with Serbia in particular.  So it was ironic he was killed by the very people he was lobbying for back in Vienna.

There are a few subreddits for brown women like /r/ABCDesiwomen and /r/brownladies but these are pretty dead because of the small population of suscribers. A ladies night thread sounds like a really good idea actually.  I've learned to ignore most (not all - some still bother me and I end up responding) of the hateful comments made because they very rarely coincide with the thoughts and ideas that people in my life have. Reading the Sunday dating thread has become entertainment for me, just like /r/relationships.  Edit: for the most part I like this sub, and it is one in which I actually participate instead of just lurk. It does have a few dark sides which bother me however.

it's not bait. I'm trying to prove that the two arguments come out to be one and you INSIST on misrepresenting to me in spite of the plain language of my post. Here's what you believe:  1. No singular moment where the Church turns away from the right course  2. But errors "cropped up over time."  So here's my problem  3. Either the seed of these errors are present from the beginning, which implies that Jesus made a mistake in establishing his Church  4. Or there's a period of time where the Church is on the right course before *a singular decisive moment when the first error is introduced, thus fracturing itself with the previous "correct" Church*.  5. I.e. there's a great apostasy  6. The usual problems with the great apostasy apply. Is it after the Didache? How is that possible? But then before? Between 34 and 60 AD? Is Jesus that weak?

Red lentil curry.   Fry onions, garlic, chili, ginger and curry spices. Add red lentils, tomato or tomato puree, stir for a minute or two then cover with stock. Reduce until there's not much liquid left, stick in a tin of coconut milk and reduced until creamy and the lentils are cooked.   Even better if you roast an aubergine, a cauliflower, some sweet potato and whatever else you fancy in more spices and chuck them in at the end.

My friend built a tiny house on some land he had because his wife got in to the HGTV craze and thought they were soooo, cute.  Now they have this house that was soooo cute and cozy when they built it, but they hate it because there's no room.  He had to put in a shed for storage, and added an office so he could hang out somewhere that wasn't a fucking studio apartment. 5 years it's been since they built the house and they're already weighing tearing the house down and building a larger one, or just building another house somewhere else. The fact of the matter is small houses seem cute, but there's a reason rich people buy big houses.  
It's not that he's a bad director (he's very good), it's just that after *Apollo 13* he became a bit overrated.  There's about ten solidly good movies on Howard's resume:  - Cocoon  - Willow  - Parenthood  - Backdraft  - Far and Away  - Apollo 13  - A Beautiful Mind  - Cinderella Man  - Frost/Nixon  - Rush  He's not a visionary director, but he's great at making relatively safe, family-friendly Hollywood films across multiple genres. After *Apollo 13* came out, the only director who could top him in terms of combining critical and box office success was Steven Spielberg.   Unfortunately because of this, it seems like studios started to give him the greenlight to make films other directors wouldn't get to make, and that (in hindsight) may have been a bad decision.  Most of his critical and/or commercial failures came after *Apollo 13*:  An F1 drama (*Rush*) when your domestic market doesn't care about F1 racing.  A $100 million film about tall ships (*In the Heart of the Sea*) when historical films perform poorly at the box office.  A romantic comedy starring Paul Blart.  A third Da Vinci Code movie.

Not bad if you're soloing, but for groups not as good 
Lair is actually quite easy and definitely the first branch you should explore.  I'd recommend diving into it as soon as you see it in your next games, you'll probably die a lot while you learn the strengths and weaknesses of each enemy there, but it you'll be definitely in going in the correct direction, and make you a better player if you persevere.

yeah we needed a 3 on the possession too...   it was just a very "dion waiters" play overall 
he went to the AG who told him not to release it for the exact reason it would interfere with the election.  Going against that advice, and sending an email to staff acknowledging the impact on the election...thats enough for intent, It does not have to show he went "this will tip the election, lets do it", you just have to show he knew (or it would be unreasonable to expect him not to have known) the implications of his actions, and yet he took them anyway, that is intent.

Whoa 
&gt; Now I move to ps4 and trade in/sell my ps3.   Again, who forced you to do that?  If I want to play a PS3 game I turn on my PS3 or us Now.  And you're totally correct, a console isn't a PC and never claimed to be.  &gt;Now I can't play bioshock. So ps4 offers a remaster! for another $60  Another absurd statement, so you're saying you **can** play it, you just don't want to pay $60 for it.  So wait a month until it's $40, or 2 months until it's $20.  If you don't want to pay $60, don't pay $60, there are multiple ways not to do so that don't involve whining about how everyone is forcing you to pay money you don't want to.

Hop onto Google, or any search engine for that matter, and type "Google election bias".  There are plenty of credible sources.  Not to mention that a handful of Google higher-ups have endorsed Killary.  Like everything else, follow the money.  I'm no conspiracy theorist, but to think that money doesn't run the world is asinine.  Edit: you're a typical Reddit douche that thinks he is always right and posts stupid fucking edits to make himself believe that his dick is longer than it is.
I'm sure you'll have a good time, enjoy yourself!
Teddy isn't always at the ranch when it's attacked by bandits, even before the Wyatt story is introduced. In episode 1 when Teddy is approaching Dolores, a guest calls him over to him and a group of friends taking him off the loop where he spends the day with Dolores eventually taking her back to the ranch.

I was also feeling down about the 2ks that are all I've gotten today but my last 3 have been Bulbasour, Charmander (29 candies!) And now clefairy (clefable evolved with dazzling gleam sadly). I've had great luck with my 5ks too: Porygon (31 candies), eggecute to power up my eggecutor and a perfect shellder. Haven't gotten a 10k since the event started but one of the 3 I had incubated gave me a snorlax (54 candies zb bs)
I don't get it. You are completely chopping up the story line by doing what's done in this episode by throwing away the progress done last episode and digressing into something new.  I hate episodes like these. So slow and boring and completely separate the plot of the show. Only the elitist here liked this episode and are calling it "perfect".
Please and thank you

Ok, I'm sure you know more about how to extract the best performance from a car than Randy Pobst. Also, being able to power out of corners earlier is a common trait among AWD cars. The torque vectoring on the front end might be able to tidy its line a little bit, but it isn't going to defy physics.

I'm excited for Nonfiction November.   I had what felt like an embarrassingly bad month:   **World of Warcraft: Traveler** will be finishing this tonight. I am enjoying this so far, it is a light read. It is a lot younger than I thought it would be though.  I probably wouldn't bother if you didn't play it ever though.   **The Well of Ascension** I enjoyed this a lot  more than the first one, but sometimes Sanderson writing really drones on.  Sometimes I would love if somebody would just say "no" instead of give me a paragraph of text. **Night** by Elie Wiesel, powerful book. The seen with the babies burning will stay with me for a long time. **Venomous: How Earths Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry** by Christie Wilcox... what a let down of a book. I had such high hopes. If somebody wants to read this, ignore the reviews about needing a background, I'm an accountant and felt like I was one discovery channel documentary away from knowing everything in the book. Seriously. And a tip to authors if you write a 180 page book don't tell me "as we talked about last chapter" that was a half hour ago, I'll remember perfectly fine. **Fortunately, the Milk** by Neil Gaiman. Meh. I guess it was fun. Neil Gaiman is so hot or cold with me. I loved Neverwhere and none of his other books have had the same effect on me.   **Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone** reread, purely for fun. **The never ending story** god this book was a let down, I actually stopped reading like 60 pages from the end because it just never ended. The first half of the book was great, the second half should be burned from my mind. **Library of Souls** by Ransom Riggs. Couldn't finish. Got half way and put it down.  Soooo boring. This series would have been 100 times better if the entire trilogy was condensed into a 500 page book. 
that's odd, that definitely sounds like a compositor thing. I wonder if the hdmi ports are connected to the integrated GPU?  Also, I just realised you said you couldn't turn on direct mode - that's maybe related :|

Hi, sorry for the late reply. Yes, I'll have the Kraken 61.
The slash between wearing and "trying to grab" makes it seem like you are deciding between trying to grab women with very little clothing or wearing women with little clothing. The latter is disturbing
Great points, but I think 5% would be too high. Of course, there is 0 way of really knowing.  As far as us know, war could be guaranteed with Clinton coming to office or impossible with Trump winning (being a Russian ally)... us peons never really get the full story.   I think generally speaking though, in contemporary times, the chances of a WW are very, very low. It is just not in the interest of the elite (the folks who actually effectively run the country), and those who profit from war, as much as it was historically.  We have entered a late-stage capitalist global economy now where power is shifting further from location-bound constraints to a more fluid, transnational power system with great consolidation. When you are one of the owners of a corporation that owns 500 businesses around the world, with countries in China, Russia and the States, war is bad for business, so it is much harder to bring about on a global, unrestrained scale... at least IMHO.   If you ignore media sensationalism (to drive clicks and sell papers) we are living in extraordinarily peaceful times if taken into account the history of man.  Besides the United States, which is an incredible war mongering super power (America has been at war for 93% of its history, an incredible 222 years out of 240 or so), and the middle east, which had been at war pretty much in some form since the birth of civilization, then we aren't doing so bad. 
yes, my poor cat always comes around whenever I'm training rosie. She knows a few of the tricks (sit, lie down, paw), and will start to do them in the background, or just poke around indignantly like, "who is this usurper? can't you see how stupid she is?" I feel so awful for her. 
So, since the (obviously) evil uncle is dead, does that mean his King Midas powers will expire? If not, I guess Chiyo will go rage mode with whatever she is hosting once she sees her mother as a gold statue. Though it seems like she is able to bring multiple demons to life instead of just one sealed inside of her, so maybe it will just cut her remaining time during extreme anger instead.
When I use the keyboard in an app, but then shut off the screen without quitting the app, it has this insane lag and becomes less responsive to typing on the keyboard when I turn if back on until I return to the home screen and go back into the app
Oh cool, just discovered this reddit. No we can all speculate in peace without endlessly having to defend the theory.  I just rewatched part of episode one and one of the first things that Man in Black says is that Dolores has a bit more pluck than normal (maybe a result of the reveries). I think that implies her code was changed after the incident to make her more docile and she is only reawakening because of the update. Which makes me wonder if it was deliberate on Fords part. Maybe he wants her to find the maze again so he can destroy it properly this time.

What do mean Carer?  I suppose my point is what would putting Delores on stand accomplish?  Would that actually change minds of jurors if anything having Witness stating seeing Steven at Salvage yard that afternoon and others who seen him testify.  I Just realized also by getting Brendan to confess also took out his best Alibi.  Plus had calls from Jodi.  Simply saying what would putting Delores on stand change when plenty of others who seen him and being his mother would that accomplish anything?  Next time someone asks for questions to ask Jerry And Dean I will state your question.
Actually it dosen't :) I mean if I'm happy then how does it suck? :P An ejaculation sure a'int the only way for one to be happy.

There are several general locations for the yachts that you pay to move to, then a number of slots within each location. You're in the right location, I think, but you don't get to choose what slot your yacht is in.

Everything looks pretty good, but a couple of suggestions:   - get 1 8 gig stick of ram instead of 2x4. this way you can upgrade with another 8 gig stick in the future  - If you can find room in your budget get an SSD. Adata makes cheap good quality ones. a 120 or 240 gig will do fine for the OS and some games.
i approve of patrick wilson. that would have been amazing to see
Can't remember which game it was, but I remember seeing one for a previous game where it actually looked similar to this, with Gini next to Hendo. Sadio was our most advanced player on that day playing just slightly right off the center, with Firmino and Lallana almost overlapping ahead of Hendo and Gini in the middle. I think our actual formation if you want to identify one depends on the phase of play we're in. This graphic only shows a slice of the actual positioning throught the game. It really shows the way someone like Lallana can be influential just by creating space for the front 3, even when he has a quiet game by his standards (not having as many touches or being involved in as many passing moves). You saw it clearly for Firmino's goal, and he's making similar runs all season, trying to drag opposing players out of position to create passing lanes, but he's also so good at maintaining balance when someone else takes up a different position, such as mane or Coutinho drifting inside or Firmino dropping deep, which you don't really see in this graphic but it's key to the fluidity that Klopp wants to see in the side
Gotta pay for those Hawaii vacations somehow. 
How she got fed debate questions early?
I'm not into corporate music.
There are a number of variables at play here and your question is answered quite well in the sidebar, but here's a few rules:  The way that she perceives you will ultimately determine what she needs you for. The more alpha characteristics you exhibit, the more tingles she will get, the more likely she will be to sex you.   As a girl begins to loose SMV (starts to really set in as 30 Approaches),  she will begin to focus more on relationships with high resource men than she did before. This doesn't mean she will neglect Fuck flings with high value alphas, but she will be less likely to get them due to her decline in SMV.   Hope that helps. Welcome to the red pill grab a book off the sidebar, set a gym routine and begin improving yourself and you'll start to see more of the sexual side of the women in your life.

I think as a playerbase we need to take the issue personally. Do we like our game? Do we want it to continue? Do we want more women involved in it? There is a way to make those things happen and it's calling out the trolls when they say shit like that.  The thing about trolls is they think other people find them funny. Make it clear to them that you don't find this type of trolling funny and it will gradually start to remove itself from the game (or only show up in low prio).  By forcing the female player base to never use mic you are actually seriously hurting your own chances of having a communicative team.
So nice to be back to the good Stray Dogs. The stuff we had would have been fine for an episode or two, but 4 was way too long.   John Steinbeck hype. I really like the way he writes in real life, so I'm excited to see how his character is in the show. And we also had a guy who seems to be Gambit? Was that Fitzgerald?

LOL you're a riot. XD But it's Dec 2nd from 6PM-midnight KST. So for us, that would be like from 4AM-10AM EST on Dec 2st if I take in DST since it's coming up soon. And that's if I did it correctly because my times get mixed up sometimes. XD So someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh Jeez-- I didn't expect so much help  Divorce isn't what I want  I have no one to talk to about this. No family. No close friends.  My wife was my sole emotional support. I confided everything in her. I thought she was my best friend.  I have a very high stress and demanding job. We have one small child. We have been married for 4 years and together for 7. Our marriage in my mind has been mostly good with ups and downs more stressful of late because of all the work that I have been doing. I have been working 4 jobs to pay the bills and my wife does not work to stay at home with our kid.  We are starting a business together next week with big financial implications for what remains of the tatters of our family. 
That still doesn't make this video a freestyle though. This is a verse with a very cohesive story and singular theme.
