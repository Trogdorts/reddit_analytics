That‚Äôs okay, I feel your struggle on the amount of drugs, sex-crazed, non-relationship wanting people in 2019, gay or not. Christian dating is hard enough but even harder for us, it‚Äôs true.
I certainly hope so. Internal audits need to go down en masse. Because this continues to happen and it's leaked directly to Schiff and Pelosi..at this point one of these departments needs to be on their calls. They're using their subpoena powers against Trump's lawyer. This is out of control and a reckless abuse of power by top congressional leaders and top officials in multiple branches.

Wait, is lane centering included without FSD? I thought normal ones only have adaptive cruise control while more advanced stuffs like lane centering, auto lane change, and summon require you to buy FSD?

Interestingly enough, I submitted an article to Changing The Times a few years back about a Communist revolt in Australia in 1948. Not to spoil too much of the plot, but things *don't* go well for the insurgents.
I wish I didn't see that.
Don't bother trying to understand crosshair markings. There is no substitution for practice. Just concentrate on where the center of your crosshair is and what it looks like the enemy ship is doing.  I will give you a couple of tips, however. One common trick of cruiser players is to slow down and turn in (towards you) when you shoot them. To pre-empt this move, aim lower and lead less, so that they end up turning under your shells. For ships in full speed turns, hold more to the outside of the turn that you think you might need to. This is to compensate for the tendency for ships to drift while turning.
Alright alright lol

RKelly's downfall!!!
&gt; There's a great write-up over on /r/askphilosophy that goes over the problems of reddit's favourite agnostic/gnostic atheist construction, that people really ought to read.  That's a good read. I have eaten a few downvotes for resisting, if not outright rejecting, the notion that *atheism* is 'merely the lack of belief in any gods.' My position is that insofar as a person could in principle hold the view described by that [stipulative] definition, this is only possible in the special case that the person in question has not been exposed to the concept of deity.  That is, once exposed to a concept, we form a place-holder belief capturing our subjective credence, plausibility, etc., and that in the case of deity, this means we implicitly accept *theist* or *atheist* roughly according to the Dawkins scale referenced in the linked discussion. To wit, a person who had never been exposed to the concept of deity could not self-identify as a theist or an atheist, but once exposed, they *would* select one (perhaps on some scale).  To the extent that this pertains to OP's 'argument,' however, is a bit of an open question, methinks. Clearly, OP is trying to argue that all parties make 'positive' claims, and that therefore all parties are somehow on equal footing with respect to the burden of proof, but jist as clearly OP is flat out wrong.  We could dive into the rabbit hole of non-black non-ravens if we like, but the simple fact is that an existence claim (i.e. 'X exists') is a positive claim which bears the birden of proof, and a non-existence claim (i.e. 'X does not exist') transfers the burden of proof to those who oppose that claim. I can appropriately insist that my opponents provide a single counterexample to a universal claim, but I cannot refuse to provide an example of a particular claim.  Effectively, OP has simply failed to understand and correctly apply syllogistic logic.
I'm about to start moving into act 5. Right now the team I have been usuing consists of 4\* duped Cap IW 4/40, 4\* duped Fury 4/40, 4\* Emma 4/40, 4\* morningstar 4/40 and 5\* sentinel 2/35. I just got a 5\* Corvus who I just ranked up to rank 2 but haven't had a change to level up any further yet. I was planning on ranking up all the 4\* to rank 5 prior to starting going through stage 5 but my question is are these 6 champs (I'll probably rotate one spot depending on the specific stage) enough to start moving through or should I focus on ranking up another 4\* to replace someone in the lineup?

I was with him until he tried to take control of the wedding from his sister and try to order her what to do. He should have talked to his sister about his concerns, but instead he very theatrically started making demands of her.  Plus, I have the feeling he will try to sabotage the MC during their competition next week, which would in effect sabotage his sister's wedding.

It changes the rating medically speaking. Range of motion, pain control, function of the appendage, etc come into play when doing a rating.   After my 3rd surgery on my shoulder my rating went up because my range of motion went down. But on the disability scale for shoulders it asks what the range of motion is. If I had lost part of the arm the rating would be different for taking that into account as well as the loss of range of mothin.

Mijo no se haga bolas, tanto Juarez como Diaz pueden llamarse villanos y ya esta. El que Diaz sea un villano no hace a Juarez un heroe, el que Juarez sea un villano tampoco hace a Diaz un heroe, esto es whatabaoutismo puro y duro.  Juarez era un reeleccionista y por su culpa tuvimos a Diaz, de la misma manera como Diaz era un reeleccionista (aunque ademas de eso un hipocrita porque navegaba con bandera era antireeleccionista) y por su culpa tuvimos a la Revolucion o "el tigre" como le decia Diaz.  La revolucion sirvio para reducir aunque fuese un poco las condiciones que ya llegaban a madres tipo Corea del Norte que sufrian los trabajadores con Diaz, como relata Mexico Barbaro. Si, causo mucho desmadres, fue un derramamiento de sangre y destruccion nacional horrible. Si hubiese sido MUCHO mejor si no hubiese habido revolucion y esos problemas se hubiesen arreglado de otra forma, pero pues es lo que habia, no puedes culpar a la gente de levantarse en armas cuando estan gobernados por un dictador.  Y no, eso no hace que Juarez sea bueno, el PRI sea bueno o la revolucion no haya sido una mierda.
One serving of Mountain Dew contains 46g of sugar. Many of my friends can down 6 servings a day, and that‚Äôs just in what they‚Äôre drinking. It‚Äôs crazy, and we‚Äôre all taught from a young age that sugar ‚Äúin moderation‚Äù is fine. A lot of people in my area have become diabetics in their 20‚Äôs abs are still told to make sure they get enough carbohydrates per meal. My dad was told to eat at least 200 carbs per day and limit his fat, cholesterol and sodium- but they encouraged fruits and juices. The nutritional information is so backwards here.   Meanwhile, I eat maybe 3-5g of sugar a day (that‚Äôs listed at least) while staying strict keto and eating under 20 net carbs/day. I‚Äôm eating delicious food without all that nasty sugar. But sure, fat is the enemy.

They need to award us xp for completing story missions. That is why it takes so long since we only get small amounts from kills.   I have not heard anything about them upping xp rates for Shepards but atleast they give an auto endorse even if they are increasing how many you need to level up.  I usually just back out now if they are doing story missions or I'll try and quickly take over a few cp's before they leave or kick me since you get like 1/3+ of the xp bar.  And since matchmaking usually sucks I'll call for backup to fill my group in my world tier 5 missions to help other shepards which more people should learn to do.

Well, I guess giving any deck a free acces to do full orcust combo its kinda okay from your point of view. Like, you could either ban mermaid or orcust knightmare. Its just which one causes the more damage.   I'm not expert in orcust but with no knightmare orcust posibly can't function properly, while mermaid its just an aid/extender for some decks that already have their own support.

NTA - Say that you need rend to be fair.  Each couple will pay equal rent for their room.  You and your boyfriend pay for your room, she and her boyfriend pay for their room.  How she and her boyfriend want to split that cost is up to them.  He can choose to pay her rent, but it's not your responsibility.  If they can't agree to this, move out.  Do renew this lease, because as you said, she might just end up squatting there.  If you move out, she can't follow you unless you let her.
Maybe there will be new evidence. When we see it we'll evaluate it. In the meantime the speculation is pointless.
Yes. In Massachusetts you need to have completed your undergrad before you can enroll in law school. I believe in CA you can study on your own and take the bar exam as long as you have a sponsor.   I would plan on completing your undergrad before law school.

Fuck I just began my journey. There's so much information here. I'm 100% on mobile, I hope those other sites will be able to accommodate some time in the future.
&gt; I don't think a lot of these guys have much going on outside of the internet  That's likely part of the problem, and letting them form internet echo chambers is good for neither them nor us.  &gt;these are real humans in pain who want to vent  There's vast gulf of difference between venting and what's going on in communities like this. If your venting is not socially tolerable, it's not venting.  &gt;or even some of the really awful sites that I won't even mention here  What makes you think they weren't already there?  &gt;What I do think might help the incel situation is more normie empathy  Everyone has plenty of empathy for people who are down on their luck romantically. Incels are *not* those people. Stating that we should empathize with the *violence* these people espouse is a dangerous proposition.  &gt;I also think more empathy and outreach to communities that face the same issues as the incelosphere, like ForeverAlone, would be helpful  Have you ever tried? I have. Got nothing but scorn and hatred in return. They don't want help, because that would be admitting that their issues originate from themselves rather than the world around them.   &gt;Also jokes about male virgins, short men, jokes about man-children, basically all emasculating jokes that take jabs at men for their sexual status, income, or physical characteristics, should stop  Preaching to the choir.  &gt;Men already have it so tough  [Everyone's got it tough in one way or another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLGP0ftWQjU). Men are the least sympathetic in this regard. If you've got problems, talk to the people who care about them, but problems related to a man's gender are not likely to be well received by women and minorities.  &gt;They go into these communities because they don't feel understood  They'd be perfectly well understood if they could process and relay their grievances in a way that is rational and digestible to the rest of the world. Advocating rape, pedophilia, and misogyny will *never* qualify for that.  &gt;I'm not sure if this ban will inevitably be a good thing or a bad thing.  It will always be a good thing. The harder we make it for them to form these echo chambers, the more likely it is they'll have to reach out to the real world to get real, truly helpful feedback on their lives. The people in these echo chambers don't get that and further isolate themselves from it by validating each others' bullshit

From the perspective of someone choosing a ship, I wouldn't want to play it because it would make completing tasks take way longer than anything else.  From the perspective of a potential Man O' War victim, I'd just run. Why would you put yourself in a 1v6 or a 3v6 situation? I don't get it. The seas are 90% sloops and brigs already, that's because no one likes to be super slow. I'd like to try a 6 man boat for the experience, but if it's just a slow-moving death machine, no one would interact with it.
I mean it as multiplayer option just like beta, we had servers, but consider the progressive system in part...
Well, for awkardness I would just say to yourself "I'm sitting in the comfort of my own home getting paid $10 for 20 minutes worth of work" and look at it that way. When I start a new job it's a little awkward at first, but once you settle into a position everything is fine. Eventually it'll be like you've been on the job a few years.  For me motivation is money. I want to buy some new computer equipment.  Tell me about Usertesting. I've never heard of it. If you're accepted to work on there, do they offer a lot of jobs? It says they pay $10 for a 20 minute video. Do you have to do video? I would never, ever do that. I don't even take pictures of myself. Talking I'll do.  How are the jobs there?  I mean that would equal about $30 an hour provided they have enough stuff I can do to keep things continuous.

Key details to check on a shed are the anal plate (divided or entire) and whether scales are keeled or smooth. As best as I remember, pit vipers have entire (not divided) anal plates, whilst most colubrids are divided. Some snakes have scales more strongly keeled on their backs than on their sides, so location and extent of keeling of scales can also be diagnostic. The location from which a shed was recovered may also be a clue. Rat snakes tend to be very good climbers, so sheds recovered a significant distance above ground level tend to belong to this genus, at least in the southeastern US.

For your comps, I would say specifically what elements - "similar elements" seem pretty vague. Also two of your comps are quite old (The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Miseducation of Cameron Post) so maybe pick something more recent?   "Cameron Persaud is supposed to finish her last year of high school strong, with the 3 of her best friends since middle school, film major girlfriend‚Äôs Tamera and Lily, and Cameron‚Äôs longtime crush, theater major Elle, as they plan on leaving dry and boring Florida and heading to New York for the college of their dreams. "  This is quite the sentence. I would maybe change it to something like: Cameron Persaud is supposed to finish her last year of high school strong, and she and her friends plan on leaving Florida behind and heading to New York for the college of their dreams."  I think this could be reworked and it's a bit too vague: Her struggle eventually leads to her going down a self-destructive path with the school‚Äôs stoner that‚Äôs got a good heart, Elliot Lifton.   What does self-destructive path mean? Also can you maybe add more about why this school is Cameron's dream school? We know her friends majors, but we don't know her major and we should focus more on her. Is film or theatre her dream? Is that still her dream after she doesn't get in and meets Elliot?  I'd also maybe try to raise the stakes a little bit - something more than "parties and romantic mischief" because that doesn't seem like enough. Maybe Elliot introduces her to a different (better) path than she originally thought she wanted?  I think I would also suggest putting all your housekeeping business (comps, genre, word count) together either at the beginning or end.   Anyway, I quite like the idea of this, it seems like a book I'd pick off the shelf :) good luck querying!
I think this is a common response in the US.I feel, but in much of Europe and many parts of Asia, it‚Äôs much more desirable.

If there is a university of college nearby, they will have some stuff in archives, and databases as well (though many private schools won‚Äôt give you database access, as these are paid resources funded through tuition).

I spend winters in Honduras where the police are simply missing in action.  There's lots of talk among ex-pats about buying guns and defending themselves when in danger.  The problem is if you shoot and kill a *local* regardless of their crime, you must grab your passport and wallet and get to the airport ASAP.  If you don't their relatives WILL hunt and kill you and the police will barely take a look.

I see where you're coming from on that. At the same time though, I feel like if you're strong enough to be the federation president, you're strong enough to conquer those empires and build more fleets yourself. I can see how federations could be beneficial if you're playing as a pacifist or something like that though.

I guess it was kind of highlighting the differences between black and white culture in the US. In some ways urban black people have an entirely different existence than white suburban or rural people and this skit was sort of playing off that. I think, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve seen it.

&gt; When we get full brain interfacing VR things will change, but current VR just isn't what most people want right now.  Yes, I know you've said this before. There isn't any real justification behind it though. It doesn't need to get to that point because people already really enjoy themselves today with VR but are often put off buying and constantly using a setup due to the inconveniences of it being 1st gen tech. The market is small and niche, because it's still in it's 1st generation so it's in a perfectly normal spot.  What it needs is to get to something as depicted in Ready Player One to be at that mainstream level, as it would then be very convenient and without almost all of it's current issues. That doesn't require a brain interface at all.  &gt;  I still prefer games to be in my screen. I don't care about interacting with them physically.  That's fine, except if you haven't experienced VR then you need to actually try it first, or if you have experienced VR you need to make sure you've actually tried the really, really good stuff like Astro Bot, Lone Echo / Echo VR, Beat Saber.  You should also be aware that VR has always been and always will be a mix of both physically active and relaxing seated games. Therefore you can still enjoy VR while relaxed by playing seated gamepad games, or even Boneworks, [which is built to allow for relaxed play](https://twitter.com/brandonjla/status/1154580767537655809?lang=en).

I guess I look at it from the perspective that he could have robbed a store or done various criminal things and it wouldn‚Äôt have changed my views of this deal.   The story is someone turning a joke into a great thing for kids and also bringing the two fan bases together. He isn‚Äôt the story he is just the catalyst that started it.   Quite frankly a puff piece in and of itself was unnecessary. If they didn‚Äôt report it and some other journalist did they wouldn‚Äôt be viewed as incapable and unprofessional at least to me and people that I interact with. I have zero empathy for the paper as a whole they screwed up and don‚Äôt even understand what people are mad about (as evidenced by firing Calvin for his tweets and not apologizing).

So this isn't normal high school debate events.  So if they made up evidence or whatever, you gotta call them out on it, and say what this does to their case as a general rule of thumb. This is called implication  "Your only response to this is a statistic with no citation and not present in  a powerpoint. That's big because they now have no response to our argument meaning we win that fully there. This is important because nuclear war will happen (or some other impact like that)."  I wrote that in 2nd person bc that's the kinda debate this seemed like.  There's a thing called flow. You prolly wont need that, but just write notes of what you and the opponent said so you can call them out on stufff they didn't adress and the impact.  Also wtf do you mean decided in real life. Slavery happened too and that doesn't mean it's right. Deciding whether something is right or wrong since it happened is bs.  I'd personally complain what this teacher thinks their doing. Grading who wins or loses in a debate of a non-debate class. Yeah, no. Go tell the principal.

It's weird at first but, honestly, it makes more sense to put the adjective after the noun. Think about it. Shouldn't you let me know what you're describing before telling me what color or shape it is? (I know it doesn't really matter because we're talking about less than a second of delay)  It also makes more sense in Spanish because adjectives are marked for gender and number so you should probably establish the noun before describing it.   As for advice, I had to binge a lot of Spanish before things felt natural and "made sense" to me. Books and movies are good if you don't have access to native speakers. Pick content you enjoy and search for Spanish versions/translations of it.   Keep in mind that books like Harry Potter, though wonderful, might have you flipping through dictionaries trying to translate obscure words like "wand" or "cauldron".

We would have expanded conflicts in the Middle East that would have most likely led to a greater world war. She would've won a second term due to the fact that the conflict would have been so big that changing leaders wouldn't be prudent. Trump never would have considered politics and in 2016 whoever the Republican was would have beaten anyone. Just like what happened IRL. I would reckon a Rand Paul would of had a greater chance at winning in 2016 after a huge conflict that Hillary would have gotten us into. Being an anti globalist as he is, his chance to win would have been then.   In truth we are much better off having had Obama and Trump than any combination of Hillary and ?

Some TIMs have been calling themselves "cis" lately because they recognize that almost everyone uses "cis" as a euphemism for real. It's not polite to say TIMs are fake and women are real, so people use the terms "trans" and "cis" instead.  There are two kinds of "women":  Trans women, aka men in drag  Cis women, aka real women  It's not hard to see why TIMs hate the distinction. It also doesn't help that they're fundamentally ashamed of being trans.

They needed permission to leave their home country and permission to come to the USA. They came over on a cramped ship, had to stay at Ellis Island to register and get a health clearance. They had kids and raised them as Americans refusing to let them speak their native language. Every one of their kids went to college, served their country, and raised new generations of AMERICANS. Never once taking a government handout. And while being ridiculed for being filthy italians.

Lets start over. You seem to have forgotten what we are arguing over. My claim was that people engaged in protest have never been attacked by the government, which is true. Your claim is that a person who protested a while back was killed on the side of the road with a couple friends so that counts as a police officer killing people currently engaged in protest. Which is incredibly stupid. That‚Äôs for being the dumbest person I have met this week.

There is a tendency for them to have a much lower percent of renters -- they don't make sense as investment properties for many, due to the large downpayment. They are usually in small buildings, so there is a bit more community feel. I was in a 20-unit building, so managing the budget was something that many wanted a voice in. (They are often confused with Ontario co-operative housing, a form of subsidized housing, which may have residents do some chores as a consequence of living there.) They really aren't at all like that. Very similar to owning a condo in a small boutique building.
To the rest of the world yeah, its pretty quiet.

It was more of a tongue-in-cheek comment. I think Morrison is a dumb person, playing a smart person pretending to be an idiot.  He's more clever than he lets on, but he's also not as smart as he thinks he is.

Did you read the sidebar? "This is NOT a politically moderate subreddit! It IS a political subreddit for moderately expressed opinions."  If you said that the sub had devolved into ad-hominem attacks and uncivil discourse, then you would have a point. But saying that a certain percentage of posts are on one side or another of the issues is irrelevant.
If you get it, be sure to write some nice Anti-Kings stuff. Good luck!

I'm probably wrong, but just spouting ideas
Hi, I used to work for about 4 years at a Cheesecake factory as a server, bartender, would help out in the kitchen when needed. a few things on the menu:  1: Everything is made in house from scratch, everything down to the buffalo sauce on the wings. My roommate was a prep cook and line cook and we would help each other from time to time. The kitchen had, at least at our restaurant (slowest in the nation), had 6 different walk in coolers. One just for prep items such as sauces, occasionally I would help with some of the sauces and other things.  2: The kitchen line has 8 different chef stations: Pasta, Saute, Fry, Flattop, Broil/grill / Pizza/Sandwich, and Salad. Each with a minimum of 6 pull out cooler drawers and 15-25 third pans on the top. For our restaurant there was a minimum of 7 people on staff for a week day and about 14 on a busy weekend night. I did some time at a busier restaurant and they could flex up to 25 people on the line at once, plus 4 dishwashers and 4 people in prep at all times.  3: Granted, yes a huge menu such as that is hard to execute, but just like MickeyDs, everything is closely monitored and each cook has to follow, and pass a test on any recipes that they cook, plus the new 7-10 new recipes bi-annually. (Cheesecake rotates out under performing dishes for newer ones twice a year).  4: After about a year there everything started to taste the same, like butter and lemon sauce; the base of 1/4th of the food at the place haha.  Think about it this way, you want to make a burger, pasta, steak, a salad, and chicken picatta for a single table. Well if you want return customers you better do them at least better than okay.  EDIT: Thank you kind strangers for the Gold and Silver, I will spend them on Serotonin and Dopamine ;)
Enjoy sticking to the theme

Ahhhh, I see!  As an upgrade to that basic concept, I think I might get a pair of [ratcheting straps](https://smile.amazon.com/AUGO-Ratchet-Tie-Down-Straps/dp/B07GG6715T?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1) and run them beneath the mattress and out either side (one for wrists, and one for ankles). They'll come out between the bed slats, which should keep them in place to prevent me from wiggling the straps over the bed corners. There's just something very appealing about the idea of being ratcheted down, and I also enjoy the sensation of having a tug from one limb pull another limb. Should still be pretty easy to tuck out of sight when not in use, too.  And considering these kinds of straps are meant to secure things like ATVs and other super heavy items for transportation, there's no way in hell the buckles will bust. If only I'd thought of this in the first place!  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
You can also be allergic to their bites, I had some in a flat once and I only saw them once, I was super high and chilling on my bed when one thought I was asleep and came to bite me. I freaked the hell out. Regular bug bombs don‚Äôt work, you‚Äôve gotta get the specific stuff for them or hire a specialist to get rid of them.

My assumption was that RJ put it in to show that men do get forced into rape and it's usually a situation that people laugh at, only recently have such accusations been taken seriously. Though I do find his affection for her afterwards odd it may be representing something like Stockholm's syndrome or even the misconceptions that a royal upbringing can cause.
The enn is described as a chant, a mantra, a calling, I've seen it called "a Demon's full name", but that particular interpretation does not seem popular. Enns are indicated to be in a Demonic or Infernal tongue, and in one of S. Connolly's books, there is a small key of what some of the words in enns mean. Enns are used for invoking a specific Demon into your space through vibrating the syllables. It is very easy to find each Demon's enn if you look up "[demon name] enn".

I am considering a private doctor because my experience at this clinic has been dramatic and frustrating.   however this time I do think it was my fault that I ran out. I had been keeping my strips in the fridge, and I guess this is not good to do unless you take them out to get to room temperature first.   So, this is something new to me that I didn't know. I kept it in there only because it has been pretty humid where I live and I didn't want them to melt (i used a pill organizer)   but I will just leave them in the wrapper out of the fridge.
"The season brought their lowest league finish since their relegation from the First Division 15 years earlier, as they finished 13th in the league, and by Christmas there were continued calls from fans for¬†Alex Furguson to be sacked as manager.

Awesome, thanks a ton.  I‚Äôve looked into the Caseta switches but I guess I‚Äôm a little confused.  Right now I have multiple scenes for day/evening/night/fun etc built into the hue app that I can automate or call on using Alexa.  Would the Caseta switch allow me to use that same setup to dim the lights according to time of day or what scene was called for?

&gt; Surviving abuse is never an excuse for being a shitty person  Except for the part where your whole comment was about how it is incredibly difficult to break that cycle. Why is there such a big divide in your mind between the parents and the brother? The parents were never violent (and until after becoming legally an adult, OP said they were good parents), yet the brother can be shitty and it is smoothed over. What if the parents both grew up in truly abusive households? Would it then be understandable them being as shitty as they are?

No, the British claimed they were on the verge of starving even late into the war, knowing that food prices would skyrocket after it ended. Sure enough, they became net exporters of food after the War due to the fact they stored it all, and made tons of money from it. They ripped off the US, Canada, Australia and especially India, where it caused a man made famine that killed millions.

She is my best friend, and her new boyfriend is a good friend of mine. I meet both of them regularly. I love her with all my heart. I think she almost fully moved on, but I feel that she suppresses her feelings toward me, tries to ignore them and doesn't think about me on purpose because she wants to make her relationship work with the new guy, and I don't blame her for that.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***  A little background first   So last night a mutual friend (I say friend but he is more of an acquaintance) of ours was snapchatting my fianc√©e. He had shown up to her work before (she works at a restaurant) and has always been nice with her. They messaged a few times before and never was it flirtatious or anything. So they were snapchatting last night but it wasn‚Äôt through the messaging function but actual pictures of him, and the people he was with, along with the messages.   At first they were talking about how we were going to see a concert in a different state when he became very flirtatious. She had asked him to stop immediately and showed me what he was saying. (Ex: his ex has the same name as my fianc√©e and said ‚ÄòI wish I could have traded my Alex for you‚Äô or ‚ÄòI‚Äôll take you up there to see the concert, you would have the best time‚Äô) She immediately told him that she was engaged to me and that we were a package deal. After he wouldn‚Äôt stop his attempts she just blocked him.   I was pretty upset at this moment because this isn‚Äôt the first time a guy has disrespected our relationship. I find in my life multiple people who have total disregard for our engagement and sexuality. I had had enough at that point so [I messaged him over facebook.](https://imgur.com/a/H0xCPBS) I went to sleep after and woke up the next morning to see he had completely ignored the message. This upset me even more and had commented on his page ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt try to hit on a girl who is engaged and a lesbian‚Äô. This finally got his attention and he messaged me back telling me to stop and calling me a dipshit.  Well that just pissed me off even more so I screenshot the messages and posted [this fine gem.](https://imgur.com/a/m8BdK4a) Which comes to the conclusion: AITA for posting that on Facebook?   **I also want to point out he also knew me as I have seen him in my fianc√©es restaurant before and was introduced to him. It is without a doubt that he knew we were engaged and he absolutely knew she was a lesbian.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Every time you see someone write "the Democrat Party" (like one of the questions shown in the fake census questionnaire) you can be sure it's conservative propaganda. It's like a weird calling card.
A lot of that has to do with the fact that our fire-and-brimstone preacher gave regular monologues about how Harry Potter contained graphic sacrifices and orgies, but he said nothing about Percy Jackson. The same preacher recently gave a sermon about how Pokemon Go is the devil's way of injecing satanism into our youth.  Speaking of Pokemon, I also wasn't allowed to watch it because "it's violent, and violence isn't one of the fruits of the spirit," but I was allowed to watch a man get whipped for 2 hours in Passion of the Christ.

I've had multiple people try to get out of pet fees.  One woman left her dog in the car in the Florida heat, and I had to get the police involved.  Another person actually put their poodle in the dresser cabinet whenever housekeeping came in.  For the woman who had her dog in the car ("It was only 20 minutes") I just waived the fee.  If you're going to put your dog's life at risk like that, what's $150?

I'm not sure why the extremely high base price is something you would want. I feel it'd be better to have a reasonable base price and be able to spec it up to high heaven in a specific way that would benefit you.  Like if you need a ton of CPU and RAM but not much GPU you aren't locked into getting a super high end GPU just because it comes with your $3000 MacBook Pro.  That was one of the problems with the trashcan MacPro. You couldn't buy it with only just the specs you need.

Mental wellness is a weird way to put it. He has finished basically 2 albums worth of material and released nothing. He is in his own head and no matter how fire everyone says it is he is tweaking it. If you ever had to release a digital piece of art youd come back every day before deadline and find something you want to tweak, but doing that for 366 days past the original date is a bit much to say releasing his work he has played for 2 sold out shows would effect his mental wellness beyond what is reasonable.

When you do vet any, including me, to the highest degree possible.   Where I live the standards of practice and the entry requirements have been steadily watered down over the last several years.   If an inspector is referred by a realtor, ask her (and yourself) if she‚Äôs giving the name because that inspector is more beholden to their outcome or yours.  And if you have the slightest doubt, find your own.  There‚Äôs no doubt there‚Äôs some ethical, hard-working agent‚Äôs out there but they‚Äôre quickly becoming a thing of the past.
I wonder if they'd limit the reward to 1 per available nightfall per week.  That would get us to run **all** the nightfalls, and not just whichever one we've stopwatched down to the minute as the fastest/easiest.  It'll be interesting to see how they attempt to pigeon hole us into their game.

This is purely anecdotal, and I am sure there are kids with actual diagnosable conditions, but as a parent of two non-violent kids who have a few violent friends and cousins, I have noticed a difference in child-rearing.   Firstly, my husband and I have never raised a hand to our children. There is no ear pinching. Because, secondly, we treat physical violence as completely shocking and unacceptable behavior. When my oldest was 2.5, she threw a ball that hit her cousin. I would like to think it was an accident but can't be sure. We gasped, asked her what she was doing and why, made her apologize and immediately left for home. There is no "retaliation" to my kids acting inappropriately because there is no "getting even" - only consequences: we leave, we turn off the tv, we go home, we don't get ice cream. We are very disappointed.  With my kids' more violent little friends, I have noticed the parents tend to be extremely strict or extremely lax. Like your friend, who would just ignore getting cursed at or assaulted. Or a parent who would flip out because his kid took a goldfish cracker offer to all kids without asking him for permission.  That being said, we might also just have kids who don't really fight or scream. We might just be lucky and it has nothing to do with our parenting style.

Why not both? This isn't a meme answer, I'm genuinely curious. Why not just do both? Blake's already got a great relationship with both of them, and I'm sure they could make a fun dynamic between Yang and Sun considering how similar the two are. It would shut up both sides of the shipping wars without feeling forced. Plus, if RT really want to be progressive, a healthy poly relationship is WAY more progressive than a lesbian couple.

I didn't read any other comments, you can link it if you want. But what I want to point out is the fact that you say it's a vague claim. I agree, there is no way to prove a person's intent, which is exactly my point. Others around you don't know if you're thinking about sex or not, some just assume you are when you get an erection. I don't believe the comment is ridiculous as it's perfectly logical, prove me wrong.  EDIT: Calling it old or ridiculous doesn't necessarily invalidate a point. I'm genuinely interested to hear your counter argument.

It's their fault because they try to put the normal ones in the same picture as the criminal ones.  &gt;Stop murdering people, stop playing the knockout game, stop robbing people, stop carjacking people, stop torturing mentally delayed white boys while you live broadcast it over the internet, stop doing all of the shit that makes you have a bad image, and your image will improve.  Literally crimes white people commit too. A lot of things can give white people a bad image, doesn't make it right though.  &gt;How many orders of magnitude more likely to commit violent crimes does someone have to be for you not to relax when you see a large group of that specific group approaching you?  If around 5/10 people actually fall victim to a violent crime by the blacks they're around, but in reality, it's not even 0.5/1000, nobody would be friends with blacks if that were true. But I guess that's something only people who are actually at least acquainted with a black person would know. Fear through lies isn't healthy. The lie is the change yall made to the real statistic in an attempt to paint all black people as violent. I saw a nice comment on another post on this subreddit, "It's blood libel used to justify violence and discrimination against whites.", just replace "whites" with "blacks" and that's essentially the purpose of people spamming the previously mentioned phrases.

Yes, that's called a nightmare you forgot. It can happen when you've got a lot of stress on your body or in your life. Source: I had that when I was dating a psycho bitch who was trying to ruin my life.  To those who aren't familiar with it, I can say that it feels like your body at the moment is manifesting the absolutely maximum of panic that you could feel. I've only had that sort of feeling a handful of times in my life and each time it felt like you could just fall over in a stunned silence, since the panic would just immobilize you.
First, I wouldn‚Äôt use the phrase ‚Äúshoot my shot‚Äù again.  Not really applicable in this situation.  Secondly, do you have any friends in common.  Someone that could introduce you.

"If these were the only two options"... They're not.
I think they‚Äôre trying to handle spawns a bit like currency.   Too much supply will cause inflation so they‚Äôre trying to spread the wealth that already exists instead of simply increasing the supply across the board. All the parks in your area having 20 spawns this whole time sounds amazing to me as a rural player.   The closest park to me had 2 spawn points until the change recently and you had to walk 2.5 miles deep into it just to access the 1st one.   Hopefully you can take some solace in losing some of your excessive spawns to spawn-starved players.

Welcome to the club, pick your poison emo or VSCO?
We all just passed the 6 month mark! And this month FH and I will be finding out/deciding whether we are going to move halfway across the country within the next few weeks... yikes. That's put a few planning elements slightly on pause (e.g. it doesn't make sense to start booking a local premarital counselor until we know where we'll be living) but I'm still feeling well on top of things.  I'm curious when everyone else is sending out their invitations? I'd been planning on 12/1 so there wouldn't be a huge gap before a 3/1 RSVP deadline (venue needs to know 3/14) but it's a (domestic) destination wedding for all guests and people have started talking about booking flights and hotels, so maybe we should get them out earlier...  What's up next:  * Deciding on invitation design &amp; wording - samples arrive this Friday! This also means we have to finalize the schedule and brings me to the next bullet: * Finalizing plans for the other weekend events like welcome drinks and farewell brunch * Finalize plans for bachelor/bachelorette parties * Ask my brother to be the officiant - I keep waiting for the right moment when he's not too busy or traveling but I just need to do it! * FH to start figuring out suit color/style; figure out if we want to ask our siblings to coordinate (since we're not really doing a bridal party and they're going to stand up with us) * (Possibly) start ordering our various decor extras like favors and card box... we may wait another few weeks on this, especially if we end up moving!

Like others have said, being aware of it and preventing another for a good long period afterwards is really important.   That said, the biggest reason to get checked out is to ensure that it's not a worse problem like internal bleeding or brain swelling, which can quietly kill you. If you have internal bleeding they'll cut a hole in your skull to relieve the pressure. It's not something to mess around with.

"I just feel like it could have easily gone on for 2 more seasons. It had the following. It had the depth of world-building."  This is exactly why it ended at the perfect time, in my opinion. It was just becoming the sensation it deserved to be; it was just becoming more or less popular. I'd rather be left wanting than end up with several seasons--or even episodes--that make you feel the show has passed its prime.

I'd remove the data structures and tools lines in your skills section. If you're going for mid+ positions, it's pretty much a given that you know how to use/understand XML and JSON. Same goes with the tools. You're a senior engineer; you've obviously used something like Postman to test your APIs. It's not something a prospective principal engineer will be impressed by reading and makes you look inexperienced.
Does Trump not get that is against the law to out a whistleblower? Is he just so oblivious to laws he thinks he can simply swipe them aside??? Impeach this Mf already!

Accelerator number 7 and Symphogear finale first, what a great way to end the summer.
This is some of the worst Gish-galloping I've seen. Let's take your last two comments point-by-point. That will show how wide of the point you've gone.  &gt;Except outlets like NYT push obvious bullshit on a daily basis and then bury their reprint. That way they can push political narratives they like and still say ‚Äúwe reprinted the article after the facts changed‚Äù.   First, this isn't a rebuttal, it's an opinion, so you don't need the "except." Second, new outlets retract stories when new information arises. What would you prefer? No retraction? I don't think you'll hold to that opinion.  &gt;It‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs intentional. And half the time they don‚Äôt even bother to reprint. They just tweet some dumb shit about how they retracted he article. But they keep the original out there for liberal shills to pull from when arguing bullshit like all this racist shit.   This is just ad-hom rambling, but it seems like you're saying that outlets don't retract their stories. That directly contradicts the image we're commenting on.   &gt; It‚Äôs bullshit and it‚Äôs intentional. And half the time they don‚Äôt even bother to reprint. They just tweet some dumb shit about how they retracted he article. But they keep the original out there for liberal shills to pull from when arguing bullshit like all this racist shit.   I'd like a source on this one. Make sure your source includes the "by liberals" information. You wouldn't want to be accused of perpetuating "fake news" when you couldn't back up a claim, now would you?  &gt;Don‚Äôt you find it odd that these leftists want a narrative to exist so bad they‚Äôre literally making it up?  This is question-begging. I don't agree with your premise, ad-hom attacks, or intentional vagueness. Who are "these leftists"?  The girl? The NYT? Why is the NYT "leftist" for reporting the story and then retracting it when the truth came out? Leftists are better at follow-up?  &gt;The problem is reporting the fucking story to begin with and not bothering to even talk to the fuckin kid.   ...which kid? The girl with dreadlocks? How would they have written the article without talking to her?   &gt;A person with their iq level above room temperature would say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna see if I can talk to this girl, her parents, her school, the children she‚Äôs accusing..‚Äù literally anyone. But they don‚Äôt, they just repeat whatever dumb shit was said and send it out for the world to read.   Reporters do exactly that. Then they update their reporting. Again, literally Journalism 101. That's why we have a retraction. So are you angry that they did follow-up and a retraction, or are you saying there shouldn't have been a retraction? You're awfully vague on that point.  &gt;Then it gets repeated by outlet after outlet after outlet. While the original outlet ‚Äúretracted‚Äù the article, even though they leave the original up, everybody else keeps pushing it until it‚Äôs well known to be false. Then it gets swept under the rug and they move back to other political propaganda.   Oh this one's easy. There was a retraction. You keep glossing over that. If another outlet picks up the story, they're still reporting the truth: "The NYT reports..." Which is true. That's what the NYT reported. That's why reputable outlets will maintain that magic word: "allegedly."  ... and then there's the part where you repeat my insult. It'd be kind of recursive to quote that again.

I'm not sure if the tsh goes lower in response to good t3 levels, or good t4 levels, or both. I've had good t3 and t4 levels but still had high tsh, it doesn't always respond the way it should. I can concur with feeling like absolute death when the meds are too high though.

A code would be real nice, if not when can i download new light?
&gt;the mled can be the same size as a 3 element pixel, as long as there are r, g, abd b diodes inside it.  Wouldn't that be harder to make than a MLED pixel with a single diode inside it though?  &gt;they could make blocks of rgb pixels without borders and assemble screens much faster  That would harm contrast ratios though since light would bleed between pixels and you would get bloom, you really want to wrap the sides (and bottom) of each MLED pixel with a light absorbing substance.

Here‚Äôs my bp feeding copypasta  It‚Äôs common for ball pythons to go off food, especially in the colder months. If they miss a feeding, wait at least a couple days before offering again. Offering food too often can stress them out.   Here‚Äôs a few techniques that might be worth trying:  Hamster bedding: I imagine you could go to any pet store and get a little cup of used hamster bedding. I‚Äôve heard of people using this to ‚Äúscent‚Äù the mouse/rat to entice the snake to eat.  Hair dryer: thaw a mouse with whatever method you choose. Just before you feed it to the snake, use a hair dryer to heat the head to around 115F, confirm with a temp gun. This gives the snake a more clear heat target when they strike.   Braining: you can cut open the head of the mouse/rat a little bit so the smell of blood and brains can attract your snake.   Plate: some ball pythons don‚Äôt like eating off of tongs and prefer to have it left in their enclosure. If you do this it‚Äôs important to check back within 15-20 minutes to see if the prey is eaten. If not, remove from the enclosure and discard. Dead prey sitting around will quickly grow bacteria. In the case of a refusal, discard the rodent and don‚Äôt re-freeze.  Tub feeding: this one is a bit controversial, and most say this method shouldn‚Äôt be used. But you put the snake in a separate tub, feed them, then put them back. The downside is this can cause a lot of stress on the snake and possibly cause them to regurgitate. It also goes off of outdated ideas about ‚Äúcage aggression‚Äù. I‚Äôve heard of some people finding success with this method. As long as the snake is okay I don‚Äôt really see a problem with it. But I think it should be kept as a last resort.   Wet or Dry: I‚Äôve seen some snakes be picky about this. My baby ball python doesn‚Äôt seem to care one way or the other. My older snake is a bit picky and won‚Äôt touch it at all if it‚Äôs wet. This can be solved with the hair dryer method from above.

After throwing various team comps at Proud to see if I can actually do it(can only get past Sieg and then Gunther starts wrecking me around 80%). I think the fight(mainly Sieg) just needs some adjusting if it were to ever come back for a future Proving grounds.  Others have mentioned the total guesswork of his AOE or massive damage single hit attack while in OD, which is really annoying. For me though, I'm also not really a fan of having a trigger buff the boss and then letting it attack immediately afterwards instead of the usual "trigger is the boss's attack this turn" but I get the sense that this didn't really bother anyone else. Makes me wonder if this will return for future Proud/Proud+ content or even future raids.

I can second secret labs chairs. I have a titan (im 6‚Äô2‚Äù) which is that exact chair but a little bit bigger and it fits me perfectly. Their chairs are fucking incredible though, hella comfortable, high quality (no shitty plastic base, stuff like that) and they look great (which is subjective really but whatever). Biggest problem is the price, but If you can justify spending like 400 bucks on a chair I‚Äôd say fucking full send. For what I‚Äôd consider a premium product, in a market that is flooded with those cheap 20 dollar amazon gaming chairs, I think they stand out as top of the line chairs. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs THE best as I haven‚Äôt tried every chair in existence but it‚Äôs definitely a glorious chair that I‚Äôd deem worthy of all the praise it gets.   Ok rant over. Btw I‚Äôm not a shill, I just really love my chair lol. When I was looking for one I did a fuck ton of research and they seemed to have the least negative things said about them across every platform I could find (it was literally like 3 comments) so I pulled the trigger and I‚Äôm happy I did   Ok now rant over

My mom was a fan of using wooden spoons on knuckles of me and my brothers and also hot sauce on the tongue when we were younger and none of us ate spicy food so it wasn't fun to say the least.  Then when she was super pissed she'd break out her work belt that was one of the bigger leather belts that were thicker and heavier than regular ones. That shit hurt. There was also a few times where one of us pissed her off during an argument or something and got slapped across the face.   The more I look back at my childhood or memories from trips or anything really the more I realize alot of that shit wasn't normal or typical.

I respect this, it sounds like advice I would give actually.  I also have health issues, I also struggle to get my husband to help (along with various other asshole traits that are slowly killing me), however my husband flat out refuses marriage counseling- the only way he says he‚Äôll agree to go is during a select few months of the year {can‚Äôt be during football season or the hunting seasons he participates in} and I would have to pay for it entirely {but only after paying off my share of our debt} which would be almost impossible as I work part time {I‚Äôm a stylist who just took a job 2 cities away from where I was working- for better opportunity and pay however it‚Äôll take months if not a year or more for that to pay off but it WILL be well worth it} with other financial obligations.  My husbands family has stepped on my toes on multiple occasions. We‚Äôve talked (and argued) over this many many times- he cannot see the issue (yet everyone I‚Äôve talked to about these situations is shocked at their audacity).   Having said all that, when it comes down to it- would I leave because he‚Äôs hurting my health? I can‚Äôt see it happening. I love him, I took vows for better or worse. No one is perfect but I see how he tries. I see the improvements he‚Äôs made since we first got together. I don‚Äôt want to break my family up, they‚Äôre my world. Frankly, without my family, I don‚Äôt know how important my health would be to me. It‚Äôs only been something I‚Äôve truly been concerned with since becoming a wife and mother.  I‚Äôm not advising anyone to do as I do, I‚Äôm simply stating that it is not just black and white. Walking out is a different beast when you‚Äôre financially reliant on your husband, you have children (especially if you‚Äôre children have special needs), etc..  I also just can‚Äôt see leaving someone I love so much because of their ignorance. He‚Äôs not TRYING to neglect his wife. He just can‚Äôt see the situation for what it really is. I think if you‚Äôve taken vows to stand beside someone on their worst days, it‚Äôs worth seeking all the help that is available, it‚Äôs worth doing anything you can to save the relationship.
good luck everyone

Made a new account for this because I don't want anyone I know to know this happened  &amp;#x200B;  So basically a few nights ago I went out for a few drinks with some mates and somehow ended up at one of my mates' flat. He's a big steroid user. The conversation somehow steered towards steroid use and me complaining about not being able to put on muscle. Dumbf\*ck that I am I asked him about using steroids and he was open to letting me try and said he can sort me out. He injected me with 500mg testosterone enanthate.   &amp;#x200B;  I woke up the next morning with some minor pain where I got injected but mostly regret. I don't judge people for taking steroids but I really don't want to be on them. Will this one injection make my testicles atrophy? Is there anything I can take to prevent that? I'm in a bit of a panic and I can't sleep. I know that the testosterone will stay in my system for 2 weeks so is that 2 weeks without my balls producing testosterone?

Never said to kill ALL things.  I believe I only said to remove/eradicate/kill/rehome/replace things I do not knowingly introduce to the tank. But hey, what do I know from the experiences I've had from reefing for over a decade now?   As a pointer, reading things through to completion may come in helpful for you in life, if you want to give it a try now. :)  Edit: exact phrase used was "remove", so if removing = killing for you, that sounds like a personal problem.  From the context I used it in, it could mean rehome/replace/kill/put in new tank/etc. It just should be REMOVED from the dt, as it's a pest.

The preshow match was Lucha House Party vs EC3 and Eric Young
Poor kid, poor you! Either he doesn't want to be there, feels overwhelmed in general and is shutting down or has a learning disability. Wish you could engage more with his parents, but I think you've got what you've got.  Sounds like all the fun of learning has already (tragically) been sucked out of his life. You're going to have to get super creative. I'm going out on a limb and guessing you teach violin or piano. Maybe get drumsticks to teach the kiddo rhythm. Bang on pot lids to hear different tones. Get him motivated to learn the theme song of his favorite tv show or game. Get him to sing the notes of a song before you play it. Anything you would typically do, turn it on it's head!
Yup. Every urge you beat is another neuron re-written. Urges = progress
Omg he actually used the original idiom "champing at the bit" instead of "chomping". I'm not a big enough asshole to correct people for saying chomping (which still makes sense in the context of the phrase, a horse biting at its mouthpiece) but I always appreciate a grammatical OG.
You can tell she filtered the shot out of it. There‚Äôs a clear line from the middle of her neck up.

u/psychicsteveunivers thank you for you quick response! I appreciate your time!
Yep - I've gotten three of these in the mail. I live in an overwhelming BLUE area and have never voted red in my life.  I think someone signed me up to their list as some sort of sick joke...   Joke's on the RNC - they're just wasting money by sending me these.

Hey guys! I love tattoos, but I‚Äôm not very picky about what I get done (other than researching the artists I want for the style I want beforehand). Do artists like being given creative freedom? Or are they too busy to want to spend time creating their own design? For example, I usually have an idea of what style I want, but I‚Äôd like it to be original so I usually tell the artist that the piece and design itself is up to them. Is this annoying or is it fun to do your own work?

I love/hate how clueless parents are sometimes. My dad is the biggest troll in my life and the worst part is he isn‚Äôt even aware he‚Äôs trolling me. That‚Äôs just literally who he is ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I mostly use weapons that eveyone hates so they can only get better.  Expect all meta to be nerf is the game; This is why I encourage everyone to use meta, so everything I like will never get nerf'd.  Also, please use more Catchmoon.
Also, also. A lot of furries are lonely, feel isolated, and live on the internet. That makes us prime candidates for recruitment. Thus, racist groups actually specifically target furries.  (When asked why they joined, most neo-nazi, klansmen, etc. Say they joined because of a sense of community. Which is one of the same answers that furries give.)  In general, the fandom is mostly very liberal though. Though I don't actually have any statistics...

NTA. It sounds like the dog is behaving way better than this spoiled brat.  However, if I were you I wouldn't blame "princess" 100% for her terrible attitude, manners and so on. Her parents obviously did a horrendous job raising her. She is of course to be held responsible for her actions, but still...

I broke my arm a couple of years ago and the total cost including ambulance, ER, stay in hospital, surgery (4 plates inserted), follow up appointments, and three months* of physio was $10 for a two week Oxycodone prescription.  (*I could have kept going for longer but we agreed that it wasn't necessary).  Of course I don't live in the USA and don't have health insurance.

Ok listen "honey", 1) I'll eat wherever the damn hell I choose. 2) Once I've decided where I'm gonna eat, I for sure won't be checking the damn calender to make sure it's not in whatever month it is that LGBTs have arbitrarily decided is "theirs".
NTA. If he doesn‚Äôt want to pay for a taxi, can he drive to your place, park there (to avoid airport parking costs) and take a taxi from your place. I don‚Äôt understand why families seem to think everyone is obligated to do this stuff. If people offer thats great, if they don‚Äôt then leave them alone

Oh yeah I used a cracked version in windows at work until last year I think LOL. Loved Nero.
sterling, it‚Äôs been a while indeed  i personally dont think it‚Äôs that terrible
Even when I left for a while because I was going to a place with bad internet, the problem was still there. I remember it working for a while because if have 3 in my folder, but that was 2016.

Cascara Cold Foam Cold Brew. The way I was taught to make it in my store was to foam cascara and nonfat milk and then pour that over normal cold brew. The girl here put cascara in the cold brew itself and used 2% in the foam. The foam didn‚Äôt hold up at all and I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy my super bitter cold brew.

Yes, I have told and shown him on multiple occasions in what condition the equipment needs to be kept. He and his mum tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that big a deal‚Äù, and that ‚ÄúI can fix it if it‚Äôs that important‚Äù.

True.  He was ‚Äúone‚Äù of the big baddies in season one so it would have been nice to see him go out in a different way.  He was such a threat in seasons one and two.  It‚Äôs a shame that they ended his story the way they did.

You have to describe "that feeling" more so we know what sort of feeling you're talking about. There could be several of those feelings when it comes to tripping!
Have these two never heard of packet retransmission? The ending of this doesn't make any sense.
I mean I think it depends. Does it smell like weed because she's lighting up in the living room? Or does it smell like weed because the smell kind of lingers on her clothes after she smoked it or she was around people smoking it? The former is understandable to be upset about, but the latter can't be helped and is going to be an inevitable part about living in 2019 and beyond.

Literal quote from one of his rallies.   &gt; ¬†‚ÄúYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.‚Äù  It's an attempt at a veiled threat, but the meaning is obvious.

Oh fuck sterling is back. It should have just stayed with the other forgotten items.
Before they nerfed it it basically was the locust gun with a magazine.  Now its just shit.
What was your run time? To get a Elite time you‚Äôre going to have to crush the 5k. OTF isn‚Äôt going to make you an elite runner. Good, yes. But you have to get more miles in than 3.5 max on a day
