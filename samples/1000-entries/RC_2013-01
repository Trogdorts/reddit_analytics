ya we were worried about this before release.

Both parties agreed on these cuts. The best part to me is that they're trying to figure out the best way to keep spending up above a 1 trillion dollar deficit. 
Ah, yes, I know the type: always going out in silk shoes and Italian leather ties, always listening to the paintings in art galleries and strolling about with their feet in their pockets.

And you think art has no influence/ relevance to history?  That's.....concerning.
BTW, the rings could just be stuck in their grooves rather than worn, although this is more common on two-strokes. If there is wear, it could be either the rings or the bores, but if the fine diagonal cross-hatching is still visible on the front and rear faces of the cylinders, they are probably fine.
Do you need a decal, or do you need a vector file of the decal?

You're right about Far Cry, it's not worth it. Graphics are fun to look at for about an hour then it gets boring. I got it free with the never settle bundle when I got my gfx card and I wish I had traded it for dishonored or borderlands 2 or something... 
&gt;Funnily enough people are under the impression that PDs are useless and she's actually been fired by people so they could hire some guy they found in the yellow pages in order to get a "better" lawyer.  From what I understand, it's usually not that PDs are useless.  They just have a nearly insurmountable case load in front of them, and they cannot possibly give you the attention you deserve. 
I always do, he usually does it back or swears. 
I am interested, I emailed the email address you gave me.
like I said it's not about luck it's about self control at this point. I'm over the luck stage.   3 friends out of 100s that have drink and drove. That's a 2% margin and not really that significant since one was essentially a passenger not a driver.....   I just find it moronic the 0 tolerance they teach people because it tells people that after drinking you have no responsibility for your actions which you very much do. It takes the blame from an individual being irresponsible and places the blame on an action. You can blame drinking and driving on everyone that does it or you can come back down to reality and realize the person driving at that point is who is to blame not what he ate or drank. 
I like feeding the Alien oil...

I think the main problem is that people don't seem to care much. I check r/vinyl a few times a day and there aren't that many posts so I think it would be very easy for someone to just look at a couple of recent posts to see if what they want to post has been posted within say, the last week. Unless you know, you really have something completely new to say.

Before I had a job I would use these. They are really versitle, and can be used to make GBs and small bongs. Really cheap, easy to clean, and really easy to conceal.

100% of my personal shooting is film, ever since I got hooked into photography 5+ years ago.  For school, I made it through 95% of all my photo classes shooting entirely film, occasionally some digital was shot if the deadline was up and I botched my film shots.  I also do alternative processes  I prefer film because I love the workmanship involved.  From start to finish I'm involved in the entire process.  When I complete and frame a print, I admire it, akin to what I think a woodworker would do.   I actually find digital much harder and I hate, no loathe, when a digital camera tells me I can't do something (e.g. autofocus doesn't work, the exposure isn't correct, etc).  Also it seems that because a vast majority of digital photographers overprocess their work, you have to spend a lot more time editing digital to make it appealing compared to another digital print.  Film gets the advantage of the inherit characteristics of the particular film you shot, the paper it was printed on, or the chemical process you used.   I shoot with a 4x5 Speed Graphic, Zero Image 4x5 Pinhole, Pentax 6x7, Pentax Spotmatic (35mm), and just recently picked up a Agfa 5x7 Field Camera

I'm awesome because I remember both sets of games!
I've been in two situations where I've felt threatened and was ready to use the martial arts I've learned (Muai Thai).  Both times, someone was being aggressive towards me and was ready to start a fight. Both times, I got into a ready stance. Both times, they backed down once they saw I was confident. The most useful part of martial arts is knowing how to use it to diffuse a situation instead of getting involved.

I think I'm going to send it. Like you said, I don't think things can get much worse between my father and I, as we haven't talked in so long.  My father and I have never had a genuinely emotional moment with one another. We've always kept our feelings in, no matter how terrible things got. It was just how I was raised. It's easier for me to send this than to talk to him on the phone, because I know that if I called him, I'd wimp out before he even answered the phone with that lovable "hello" of his...  I'm going to do everything in my power to reach out to him, because I'm afraid of what will happen if I wait too long.

Do you enjoy podcasts? I highly recommend the Joe Rogan Experience, Duncan Trussel Family Hour, and The Church of Whats Happening Now with Joey Diaz. All great podcasts with hilarious interviews and interesting stories, but above all they are very inspirational. Basically a do or die message in all of them, but I find that more motivating than being gently encouraged. Give it a shot. It has definitely changed my life for the better by listening to these guys. 
I know, I can clearly remember the sense of uncontrollable panic and fear that that she must have felt. It's one of the worst emotions I've ever felt.

Did you read my OP?  I had already mentioned I had a look at the climate data available on Wiki, I just wanted to get people's own personal experience with weather in those locations at that time of year.  I can look at the average high for Kyoto in October and it says 22.9, but for all I know the start of October may still be quite warm and humid.  I don't know where over the month of October that average rainfall is distributed, for all I know it may all fall in the first half of the month then dry out, or do the opposite, hence me asking!

Not speaking English at home has sort of made me understand and learn other languages but makes me feel embarrassed some times being a foreigner. Having to explain that to a girl seems embarrassing in the U.S. I wish I spoke a sexier language like French or Italian.

On an unrelated note, want to know the next disaster waiting to happen in the fire blocking industry?  Well just look up fire stopping foams, they don't do shit, but are cheap and easy to install.  The reason this is a problems is that fire stopping products exist to give people time to get out of a building after it catches on fire.  The foam stuff fails and bursts into flames well before other products on the market that are more expensive.  Tl:DR You get your house made by someone cutting costs you are more likley to die in a fire.

I think part of the reason we get less views/votes is that the average PC enthusiast from the US and UK is expecting 1000 dollar CPU and dual water cooled 500 dollar GPU. They have become a bit jaded.  The art of the build and making something from nothing has fallen away. Back in the old days of pin mods and Bonneville rads people had to be inventive and make stuff up as they went along.  We may be a victim of our own success in away, You can buy full custom cases that cover almost every need. And there are so many places selling water-cooling and Modding gear.  back to basics, back to form and function, back to a realistic budget. that's where I'm headed...

I was stupid. Of course I learned from it.  If one doesn't learn a lesson after something like that, which is the case with a number of offenders in Quebec and Ontario, then remove their licenses after the second offence, and jail time after the third. But unfortunately that doesn't happen.

Sad human :( Still maybe there is a way to do more fine scaled typing of what kind of IO function can do?  Lot (most?) of the programs do IO. I would think that such feature (where IO exactly goes in/out) would be kind very usefull.  I really would like to know from function definition: this function writes only to log, this other function writes to result file, other-other function writes to stdout. But, as I understand now, it is possible only to say if function at all writes to some file  or not. And all functions writing to files seem exatly the same in this respect (or do they not??)  edit: remove pornographic images

More an issue of maturation of the platform than incremental upgrades. Still the processor difference between the 4s and the 5, is night and day, let alone the addition of LTE.   And the absolutely had a reason to change the dongle, the old 30 pin was rather large relative to the device. I'm assuming beyond the propitiatory advantages of selling their own crap, they opted for the lightening since microUSB only powers up to 9watts, so it'd be 10% longer for an ipad to recharge.   
Its also a lot easier to avoid using while being on it.  You can set up so it forwards messages from important circles (people you selected) to your gmail.  I never use it for the social aspect, but it has proved to be extremely useful in organizing work time on different machines in my lab.  Also you can link to stuff in other google interfaces, such as calendar, very easily.  Basically I've found it to be an excellent tool for organization of a small laboratory group (~7 people at the moment).

First, I'm sorry for the difficult time you are going through.  Rest assured, many of us have been there.  As for advice, when you talk with him about his drinking, realize that bargains and ultimatums won't work.  They may for a short time but the resentments will come back.  I gave my wife many ultimatums and she'd stop for a while.  Then when she would start again (and she always would because she stopped for me, not her) it would be worse. I'd think, "If she really loved me, she'd stop."  I never recognized the disease for what it is.  A disease.  It's like saying, "If you love me, you'll stop having cancer."  This isn't to excuse it.  The alcoholic doesn't have a choice in the fact that they are an alcoholic.  They have **ALL** the choice in treating it.  When I finally talked to my wife, and kept the focus on me - *I feel, I worry, I'm scared.* I could tell her what I was experiencing without pointing any fingers, and I think she listened. In my case, I was extremely lucky, she entered recovery shortly after and has been in recovery ever since.  We both have.  But I have to realize thet her recovery is her own and may or may not last.  We measure recovery in time since the last drink, but it probably ought to be measured in time to the next one. We have to remember that we can find serenety whether the alcoholic is drinking or not by accepting that we can't control whether they do or not. I hope that youreach out to your higher power, work the serenety prayer, and find some peace.  Keep coming back.

Can't wait to use that one!
I'll give it a shot.  Some people quite enjoy the brutality of death metal. I, myself, enjoy a very large variety of metal. There are several types of metal, Death metal is just one of the ''Main Branches''. Death is typically consisting of blast beat drumming,guttural growling for vocals (This is a term we metalheads use typically in describing our music, ''vocals'' instead of ''singer''.) people who dont listen to a great deal of metal usually focus solely on the vocals and say 'they are just yelling', this is mostly because most other forms put 'the singer' at the front and center of the mix as most pop acts dont use instruments (ill behave and not get sidetracked on a rant here about current music.) However Metal generally isnt simplistic as just vocals, more likely the vocals are just a layer on top of 'the band'. The usual set up for a metal band consist of Vocals,1 or 2 guitars (lead and rythym; Sometimes duo lead),Bass,Drummer, Some genres have keyboards. More exotic set-ups such as Folk Metal and Symphonic Metal contain Full orchestras or smaller set ups of violins,horns etc. Onto the subject of Death metal, It is called a 'Extreme Metal' genre along with Black Metal,Doom Metal, and Thrash Metal. They are 'Harder,heavier' brands of metal that are not for everyone. However i will say that i firmly believe that theres a genre of metal out there for everyone. Gateway bands include: Black Sabbath,Iron Maiden,Judas Priest,Metallica (early),Led Zeppelin (debatable, some would argue they have building blocks of early metal),Deep Purple (same as LZ). If the screaming bothers you theres several great genres with masterful instrument playing (which is why i enjoy metal and symphony music, vocals are never top priority for me). You might enjoy such genres as Power(Sonata Artica((edited for spelling)),Stratovarius,Helloween.)Progressive (think Rush but heavier). For more information on the extreme diversity found in the Metal family please take a look at this:http://mapofmetal.com/#/home (might be loud careful). I'm sure if you give it a chance you can find something even you will enjoy, not all metalheads enjoy the yelling and screaming.
Please tell me that this is a joke.

just waiting for the fuck it il post in r/treesgonewild...nude..
Wut... I don't get it.   Anyone care to elaborate? 
I was on what would be best described as a second date, with a best friend(lol the drama)  She has an amazing voice, i mean gets standing ovations at karaoke kind of voice, real beauty, gets into it, sells the whole damn act. Which is what we were doing at a dive bar in ohio, karaoke. This old rough looking guy, which is pretty standard fare for a blue collar town, buys us each a round of drinks after she kills a song.  Nothing out of the ordinary. He ends up buying another round for us after another song she did.   Now me and her are both fairly heavy regular drinkers, we know our limits if we're driving eventually, we know where to draw the line. We know each others limits, and watch out for each other. We only planned to have 4ish drinks the whole night.   Here were are, on round 3, 2 from the guy, 1 from us. I honestly felt fine, until i tried to walk to the bathroom. Got light headed, bit dizzy.  Kept falling to one side as i tried to piss.  I figured i had low blood sugar, since I had no eaten anything at all that day, and had recently had some low blood sugar issues.  Again did not think much of it, grabbed a bag of chips and a piece of pizza from behind the bar. Thinking all is well in life.   She seems a bit more flirty and energetic than usual, I took it as nothing more than that she was really into me(should have been first clue something was terribly wrong, i have no confidence with women nor ever assume they are into me)  We get our selves round 4, half way through round 4 we both start acting drunk. I mean 14 drinks in 3 hours type of drunk. We did not realize it at the time, but the memories eventually came back.  Old guy starts asking some questions. "Are you guys together? did you come together?  are you leaving together? where do you live? did you drive together?" He says to her "where did you park"   Finally a lite bulb goes off in my head that this dude is not safe at all.  I tell the old dude to go grab us some more drinks. I grab her hand and we leave out the back door. At this point we're still not self aware that we are horribly fucked up.  We hug, and etc etc. She gets into her car,i get into mine, and we take off on our separate 10 and 15 mile drives home.   Next thing i remember is being on the side of the rode at 5am, several hours later, only 3 blocks from my house, puking and dizzy, getting a text from her telling me shes in parking lot, and has no idea where or how she got there.   Sure the night could have ended with a deadly car accident, a rape and murder, or 100 other bad ways.  Luckily we are able to look back on it, tell the story, and laugh about it.   **TLDR**  Do not take drinks from strangers. Ever. 
Absolutely we do.

wellp, i mean, if they work for you, that's cool. but there is a reason they're called *beats*. beat heavy genres, especially where the beat is carried with a low booming bass, or where you need lots of bass to be able to hear all the bassy sounds (dubstep)  - those are the target audiences of the brand.

If you believe you might get too drunk to drive, I think it is better to take a cab while going and while coming back. Even if the towing is free, it often causes damage to the car (I have heard of scratches, power windows not working, etc.), and the cost of repair would be more than the cab fare (if you are in CU, it is ~ $10 - $15, depending on the distance).

Sadly, completely and utterly shitty situation. You're the parent... YOU deal with the outcome. 
If you hate slaving away at your job you should not go nuke. You will work 100 hour work weeks in port and 24 hours a day underway. The way they are trying to entice you with bonus and loan forgiveness is a scam. The recruiter will tell you anything to get you to sign. If you want to be an officer go to OCS, you will never get around to it if you enlist. You sound like you want to be sold on enlisting but it will be a mistake. Also they will not give you STA 21 for one class, and you are old so you are not what they want for that particular program. I was 24 when I enlisted with the same intentions you have. Wanted to move on with my life, figured I would easily get picked up for OCS ( already had degree) and I could use the money to pay off college. I did pay off college and cruise through nuke school, but now I'm paying the price. Talk to an officer recruiter. If you have more questions PM me. You will be in DEP for a while waiting to enlist, might as well just use that time to get that credit and go straight to OCS.
I'm so sorry she's doing this to you. This makes me cringe.

Don't lie down in your bed and turn off the lights.  Your body associates this with sleeping.  Nap in a room with natural sunlight or with the lights on.  Sit in a recliner or couch with your feet up but your body vertical.  Or if you'd rather lie down, do it with your clothes on, without a blanket and on your back (especially if you're normally a side sleeper).  Basically, you want to make sure your body knows the difference between sleeping and napping.

I am so incredibly anxious for this album to drop.  However, I also am wondering if Earl will be able to handle to potential monumental hype that will come with Doris' release.  We saw what happened with Tyler and Goblin, and how gracefully Tyler was able to dance with that hype, but Earl is notoriously more reserved, and haven't shown signs that he can stand up on his own two feet just yet with publicity.   Sometimes I even wonder if EarlWolf will be more publicly successful than Earl Sweatshirt because Tyler has his back even in the name itself.  But I might be overthinking it; he's not even 19 yet.  He has a lot of time for growth.

The engine being open source would not mean that the game resources are no longer under copyright. Even if someone did port the engine, they wouldn't be able to use the resources. They'd just have an engine running that was compatible with the resources. Why spend all that time/money on porting an old engine when you could pay for the use of a modern engine (like Unreal or Unity3D) instead?  Some of the same issues exist with ports of Doom or Wolfenstein or other older games, but I strongly suspect that the relative complexity of Doom's source is low when compared to UT's.  Basically, Epic would be the only company likely to bankroll / attempt a port of UT, and it doesn't really fit their plans. (I'd imagine that UT3 or UT4 is more likely to be ported, since they're actively working on those engines.)

(American who studied French and dabbled in Spanish here)  I find the conjugation point odd because to me the Romantic version of conjugation is much more complicated. Instead of having various suffixes (which depend on which ending the root has!) we have separate words that are pretty much impossible to confuse (would, will, have, etc.)   I would expect a native Hispanic to say something like 'the spelling is atrocious' which I think is fairly obvious. (Although to be fair, the ability to shamelessly steal/import any good word that comes along is also one of its great strengths, so it's a bit of a double edged sword.). But to have conjugation be the bone to pick... Well I just can't wrap my head around that. :/ can you give an example?
Wow that is impressive ,did you teach your self those skills?
Thanks for the suggestion!Have a happy new year lad
What a hero.
Dont forget they also have Thomas Robinson (why did they draft another Big when they already have Cousins and Thompson when Harrison Barnes, and DAMIAN LILLARD were still on the board). I think they need to blow it up or just give the keys to Tyreke.  I don't trust their ability to put a competitive team together with a bunch more lottery picks. Only pieces on the keys I would trade for:  Cousins, Evans, Robinson and Thompson.
No, you're right.  There is absolutely no proof, and I hesitate to put that kind of blame on any person.  That's a really big accusation. I don't think that he would start spending it even if he did take it.  Rather, it seems like he would just hang on to it in case things went sour with my mother (since they've been having problems lately).  Nevertheless, it's a good thing to look out for.  Fortunately my mother has money in her bank account too, just not nearly that amount.  I have never understood why she kept cash around rather than keep it in a bank.  She's always just been very self sufficient I guess.  Certainly not something I would do.  I never imagined it was that much.  She is taking the loss well though.  Kind of a 'it is what it is, there is nothing I can do about it now' mentality.  I can't imagine that kind of loss though.
Is that a metaphor?

The only way to have better map awareness is to stop making MIA your excuse and look at the map/buy wards.

Get the EVF for it. It's a good unit, loads better than the pretty bad screen. It will help you with manual focusing since the resolution is larger and therefor sharper.

&gt;so that we're not pushovers  I think you're getting at something here.  Politicians are having difficulty reaching compromise because they are afraid to appear weak; to give up any ground. It is a great rallying cry to declare that you will not surrender your principles, but the result is that they fight over everything with no solution in sight.  **TL;DR** John Wayne may have been an awesome man, but he would have been a shitty politician.
He has all the charisma to be a judge on American Idol.

is there rent-control in oakland? i think there is in SF...might be a good time to tie down a good place if you can while prices are still relatively affordable. not great about prices going up, but if it raises the tax base of the city, it cant be all bad news.

I have always read that "time" is the fourth dimension. I am no actual physics student though. Is this belief incorrect? 
Unfortunately I work for the Malaysian government in the education sector, and I just went through simple interview to get the job . My housemates back in Auckland were all Engineering students from Malaysia though, and a few of them were bound by contract by contract to work with the government and others by handing in job applications and went to interviews. It's not really a big issue about experience , especially for Engineering but from my friends who studied Commerce, being able to speak Mandarin is a huge plus since the Chinese is the economic driving force in this country while the majority Muslim Malays typically work in the government sectors.   All my friends are entry level Engineers and they're doing just fine,especially if they're educated overseas as they are thought to have higher degrees of professionalism and work ethics. I guess you should start browsing around engineering multinational companies in either Malaysia ( or even Singapore and Indonesia). The culture is not much different and multinational companies tend to have a higher standard of work ethics. I sadly have no friends who are civil engineers though - the government stopped sponsoring Civil Engineering students to study overseas since 1998. You should try visit Malaysia first as a tourist before you decided that you want to stay here. It's not all rosy here- with corruption, institutionalised racism  and everything. 
Hey, I'm well into the sixth and I see no trace of penis. 
I never bought a DVD/Blu-Ray in my life.  I haven't bought a music album since ~2000 or so and it was on Tape.  I have absolutely no desire to re-watch a movie once I've seen it the first time. Blu-Ray/DVDs are a pointless medium from my point of view.  I paid for content I actually wanted to see ONLINE. I was sorry I did because the movie turned out to be incredibly shit.  ...yet I pirate most shits because they're not available to see when I want to see them at home. Most shit I pirate I don't even watch. I try 10-15-20 minutes then I delete because it's so shit.

On the other hand, what kind of idiot forgets that they left $300? This could be seen as an opportunity to teach that person an important lesson about financial responsibility. I'd hold onto it during your stay and see if they come back to the hotel to try and get the money back. If no one asks about the money during your stay, then IMO it's your lucky day.

My response to such behavior was to make a WG deck that revolved around sitting around and doing nothing until my opponent ragequit.  I won two games by running people out of cards, and one with a Door to Nothingness :D.
Sure, but if you're going to play for 30 minutes obviously you don't pick something that is longer then 30 minutes. Almost all games however allow for 30 minutes of gaming.
Policy expressed in Comic Sans is immediately rendered invalid, laughable, and worthy of mockery.
To answer his question anyway, it's because at least 8 of the 9 main characters in TF2 are male, so it's easier to make male/male fanfics instead of male/female or female/female. Similarly, most characters in My Little Pony are female, so by furry standards, brony stuff is heterosexual.

1)  I do not have proof that god, or proof that he gave us morals or a conscience.  I do however know that we are given morals and a conscience at birth by someone!  I am not arguing that there is a personal god, or that god 'cares' about us, or the individual(s).   There is a divine power that I choose (for simplicity's sake) to call GOD.  Speaking about GOD telling us slavery is bad, etc...  People are product of their environment, and MANY people back then didn't think blacks were sub-human or deserved slavery.  The majority did, I must admit, but this was solely due to a sick society, and a result of a power-struggle.  Obviously these "smart" higher-then-thou white people knew that what they were doing is wrong.  They just didn't care, because other people supported it, and it was the norm.  It became the norm because some people are truly heartless fucks.  They assumed that since other societies were not as developed, that they must be inferior.  Just because a society makes it normal, in no way makes it right!  2) I agree 100% that "sovereigns" should not share all the benefits we have.  I also agree that I am lucky that I live in a democracy. I do however disagree that we can work to change it.  We can try, but when literally, all the cards are stacked against us, and everyone is happy with the illusion, it makes it really REALLY hard.  Corporations control the government.  This is fact.  Now please shed some light on how one person or even a group of 10,000 can change anything when there are politicians with millions of dollars spent on their campaign and their advertising.  Not to mention that only "official" politicians are allowed to join in the televised debates.  Also, the TV stations are run by the very corporations that "make" the politicians.....  If you have some answer to this, I would really love to know.  3) Taxation on every single dollar you ever make/spend/receive IS SLAVERY.  Who gets the money and how is it spent?  I would agree with you that it is not slavery, ONLY if it is (let alone could be)  proven that none of the money went to international banks or lining the pockets of the already well off, or lining the pockets of the politicians, or lining the pockets of the politicians brother who owns the company that does this.  I like to think of it as a fee for civilization, but when things have gone this far down the tubes, it's naive to think that we are not being scammed for every cent that they can get away with.  .....  I am proud to be Canadian, and believe we are the best country in the whole world.  I am incredibly lucky to have all the things that I do, and am very privileged.   I do however, see that the end is very near (relatively speaking). We cannot afford to ignore our social ills anymore, as it just snow-balls and becomes worse year after year.  If people wake up and stop being such selfish cunts, and love each other, then things will change.  You cannot fairly argue that the system is not designed to create poor to satisfy the rich, while keeping a grip on peoples minds through media, entertainment, billboards, ADS ADS ADS ADS everywhere.  As long as we pay interest to a world bank, for our own government spending, we are doomed.  Imagine if you could keep all of your income tax for your whole life... You would be immensely rich and prosperous.  The reason why they care so much about you being alive, is because you're just another cog in the tax machine, with a designed life-span of X amount of years, to pay X amount of taxes, so the powers that be can reap the rewards of millions of peoples hard work, "scott free"  , only because were all too stoopid to realise the truth, and are more concerned with American Idol and NFL football.  IF THE NEWS WASNT PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU THINK A CERTAIN THING, then things would change.  They have monopoly over EVERYTHING, while we sit there and eat their shit, and "some of us" ** wink wink** get so drawn into the system that we actually swear by it and even defend it ?  What a joke.
Straterra has some initial side effects that usually wear off. I tried taking it once and for the first month or so as I was titrating the dose up, I had the same kinds of side effects (especially lethargy.) Over the course of the week they'd get slowly better, and then when I increased the dose they'd come back. After a couple weeks on what ended up being my proper dose, they went away. I ended up switching back to Concerta, but it was because the drug wasn't working as well for me and not because of any side effects.  TBH, it takes some people a lot longer than a couple of months to figure out the right medication and dosage. I noticed in another comment that he's getting his meds from a GP, and if they don't know much about ADHD then this could be a problem. Some GPs assume that they should base a person's dose on their weight and height, but ADHD meds (and a lot of other psychiatric meds) don't always work like that. This is why you're supposed to titrate the dose up – start by taking the lowest dose for a week, then move up to the next one for a week, until you either are satisfied that the drug is working (in which case you stop raising the dose) or until you start having bothersome side effects (at which point you go back down to the last one.) If your boyfriend's doctor just started him out at 60mg based on his height and weight, then he might be taking too much.

Well, I was kind of arguing that MMO-s are terrible (so it wasn't much of an improvement), but I only do that jokingly these days as people have shown me that while I may hold that opinion, I honestly, straight out, no sarcasm don't "get" MMO-s.
Being flexible as well as strong is important for aerialists. But you first must have the strength before all else. Yes, pull ups are going to be hard, and you may not see much growth at first, but they are a must, no getting around it. Every aerialist worth their salt can do pull ups.  Practice until you can get one full pull up. Then just work that one pull up for a while. Then challenge yourself to two, and then so on. Strength will come with time. You may not see immediate results, but it will come in increments, and you will see it in the long run.  Contortion classes will help your flexibility, but be aware that flexibility may take a bit longer to work on. With contortion, just being able to extend your stretch one or two inches more can be a major milestone, even if it doesn't visually look different.  Work on both. But the first hurdle is strength. Just know it will be hard work getting there, but it is worth it.

I don't find Dota 2's shaders and particle effects to get in the way at all. There aren't a whole lot of over the top animations or ragdoll corpses flying around, so playing at max settings just makes it clearer. I do like SC2 at High settings with a few unnecessary visual things turned off, rather than max.
That's whatsup!
OK So Here goes.... I picked up an older lady in her mid 60's from jail. She asked me to take her to one of those mega churches, where she says she left her car. She had gotten booked for assault when apparently during the "passing of the love" someone touched her and she hit him. Her car had been towed and so we went to the impound lot. Once there she asked me how much to "rent" me for the day. I was actually about to get my gas shut off if i didnt pay by COB next day so I was glad for any large money. I owed $170 to keep it on.  Well we settled on about $200 and she paid Half the cash and asked me to drive her in her new mercedes to a rib place to get a meal. During the drive she told me I was driving too slow and to "kick this german bitch in the ass". Before we went in to the rib joint she briefed me that I was to escort her properly and treat her like a lady on a date. We ate and she asked em to drive her home so she could call over her friends for a party. We got to her house and she asked me to watch her shower then asked me to do the same. After the shower she asked me to dress in a sheet toga style so I could be "The king" and judge her and her friends in a beauty pageant. When her friends came over it was apparent this was a regular event. her friends all undressed and redressed in several designer gowns then had me judge them as princesses of the realm. It was very surreal, and although I was ready for this to devolve into a little old lady orgy, no sex happens. At eh stroke of midnight they gave the the other half of my cash and sent me home. Not the weirdest night of my life but very surreal.
What a handsome boy!

I just checked [the wiki](http://gearsofwar.wikia.com/wiki/Locust_Horde) and have to say I'm confused. There seems to be two groups, Locust Horde and Lambent. I don't see how a group of abondoned mutants suddenly became a cohesive body called The Locust Horde. There doesn't seem to be any time frame given for this, which makes it confusing the next section beginning with the rise of the Lambent. Is Lambency a logical step that all Locust are heading towards as they continue mutating? What's the timeframe between initial New Hope people and Lambent? I only played GoW2. Don't mind hiding spoilers as I'll play it when I get around.

Thanks man you too.
On my last re-read I realized there was much I had forgotten, and these little snippets illustrated some of it.   1. I had remembered Harry's interview in the Quibbler during Order of the Phoenix, but had forgotten that Harry named Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Nott's fathers as Death Eaters, yet they could not retaliate against him because it would be admitting that they had read the article, which Umbridge had banned the school from reading or mentioning.  2. I remembered the bit about leprechaun's gold being temporary, but had forgotten that they learned that in Hagrid's class during Goblet of Fire. He brought out nifflers, then buried some gold for them to dig up for a fun class competition. Ron's niffler got the most, so Ron won some chocolate.  3. I had remembered that Harry re-covered his copy of Advanced Potion Making in Half-Blood Prince, but forgot that Madame Pince was horrified when she glimpsed how much had been written on the pages .
&gt;I really like the Kanye verse, it saves the song.   I hear that. I can't get the verse out of my head lol
So your new wife, less than a week after being married, is already being passive aggressive?  Seems to me that you likely knew she was capable of this before entering into the relationship.  People don't suddenly become passive aggressive after marriage.  Personally, assuming the story is exactly as you have posted it, I think you have done nothing wrong and she's being a child.  You had a wonderful week together and she gave you permission.  That being said, if she gave obvious signs, like being frustrated or angry when telling you to go snowboarding, then you could've played it differently.  She's being passive aggressive and acting like a child, but you got yourself into that situation.  Your options are really either discuss how she's acting with her to try and reach a resolution and then either stay in the relationship or leave it.  That's about it. Hopefully she realizes she was being ridiculous, but from the experience of watching my father marry a passive agressive and immature woman, that might not be the most likely of things to happen.
I believe its "Day of the Dead" or something along those lines.

For a birthday celebration?  California Grill.  No contest.  The reasoning here is that you not only get excellent food, but if you time it right, you get to overlook the MK during fireworks.

I actually agree with you.  While I think LeBron's average would be stupidly high in college, the defensive end would still make them beatable.  Even if he could score on the majority of plays (which since I think he would likely be triple teamed at least I think he would still be stopped every once in a while), he can't guard five players at once.  The opposing team would also get any shot they want, and score at will.  It would lead to a really high scoring game, but not necessarily a given for the LeBron squad.

Funny how it looks like the UK and the rest of Europe... kind of.
&gt;"I'm saying that America is the richest country in the world and MILLIONS have no coverage."  Millions are homeless and have no food as well. Should we subsidize food and housing as well?   &gt;"Pharmaceutical and medical countries still make a ton of cash off of breakthroughs."  Pharmaceutical companies make money from insurance companies. The pharmaceutical companies invest years and years of time, energy and money for the remote chance that their efforts will result in a viable, sellable product that works. Most often that investment does not pay off. When it does, it not only needs to pay for the failed attempts but also to make a profit for the company and its investors. Monetary incentive isn't a perfect system but it DOES create genuine breakthroughs that might not have otherwise been discovered without it.  The alternative is government subsidization of health care services where caps are placed on how much insurance will pay for certain pharmaceuticals experimental treatments or procedures. When this happens, the financial incentive for risk takers is gone which inevitably results in these people not funding research. This in turn causes breakthrough research to either dramatically decline (at best) or be entirely eliminated (at worst).  Obama care was crafted by design to take the financial benefit away from private industry and gives it to government to manage. This is the direct opposite of what the U.S. government was established to do. It was meant to create greater opportunity for its citizens. We are the richest country in the world because it has been the way we've done things.  With the government taking over more private industry and giving less or no incentive for private industry to invest you can bank on the fact that this title will go away soon. This is especially true when this strategy is adopted alongside runaway entitlement spending... something Obama has indicated he is unwilling to cut from budgets.

Persona 4 Arena led the pack for me this year. Great use of the Persona license, offering up a pretty good story to drive the action. More than just sheer fanservice, though, Arc System Works really seemed to pull off a somewhat unique feeling fighting game. Mechanically, I don't feel like P4A really achieves a lot of brand-new things for fighting games, but it does remix them in a way that feels fresh and new (in my opinion, the Personas are merely stand ins for heavy attacks, but the thing that makes them unique is that they are vulnerable to being hit and being disabled temporarily). For me, it was a mixture of being Persona-based *and* being distinct-feeling that really made P4A stand out.  Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was pretty brilliant as well. Not sure if its netcode was based on the stellar netcode of Soulcalibur V, but it really sings online, moving the status quo for online play forward for fighters. Absolutely huge and relatively balanced cast, though it's not perfect. Still, this is quite possibly the most robust fighting game ever produced.  Soulcalibur V had stellar online play, and for a Soulcalibur game, I thought it was superior to 3 and 4. I still got nostalgic for 2, though, and I still end up having a better time playing 2 at one of my local arcades than actually playing SCV at home. Still, it was fun and made for a good game, just not a great one.  Street Fighter X Tekken was a game I really wanted to like. I enjoy the aesthetic of the game -- it takes Street Fighter IV's aesthetic to a wilder, vibrant new place. Mix and matching Street Fighter and Tekken gameplay elements always seemed kind of interesting, too, but there's just too many underwhelming mechanics and game-breaking bugs in the game. There's a huge patch on the way, and I hope it does make SFxT more palatable, but I fully understand why this game seemed to completely fail with the community.

I can't get the video to play, even when I 'temporarily allow all this page' in Noscript. :(
I think it has as well, put primarily because it was released when it was. If I remember, even Mel brooks has commented to the effect that they could never get it released today because of the gratuitous use of the n-word (despite the fact that the 'racism' in the movie is part of the joke)

RS youtubers are always saying that it's not going to last for much longer. They have absolutely no way of determining that for a fact. All they are doing is pandering to the "OMG RS IS DEAD" retards for views and subscriptions. 
I'd like to see Clinkz more often too. (I don't follow pro dota very closely so sorry if I'm misguided.) A Clinkz that gets a fast Orchid can really cause trouble for heroes like NA, AM, and weaver that rely heavily on their escape mechanisms. Watching Funn1k play Clinkz is always fun
I have trained in martial arts for about 25 years. On one occasion I was laying in bed with my girlfriend - we lived in a basement apartment. It was about 3am and I heard something at the window (that woke me up). I then heard the noise again, it was the sash window being raised. I went to the window naked, drew back the curtains and there was someone trying to lift the window so they could get in. At this point my extensive training kicked in - I started to scream with rage, punched the guy through the window and then slapped the walls while continuing to rage. My girlfriend, woken by my screaming, also started screaming. The would-be burglar ran away - I got some clothes on and ran outside but he was long gone. I then noticed that I had cut my arm open on the window, so I had to go to the hospital and get stitched up.  In all seriousness, my training has been invaluable in knowing how to not get into fights - situational awareness, things like The Fence and having the confidence not to need to fight. In the few actual fights I've had, anything that involved fine technique did not occur to me - the adrenaline makes it hard to do much else. However, lots of training of good striking technique helps with delivering power. The most surprising thing is how quickly a fight finishes - most people can't fight, but think they can. Just knowing how to punch in a straight line rather than a big arc is a major advantage.  Last point - I was once surrounded by 5 or 6 people. They would have kicked the shit out of me if the police hadn't arrived to help me. It's not until you're in that position that you realise how difficult it would be - we all think we could Jackie Chan it, but I just froze with fear/panic.
This game was awesome if you had the expansion pack....or was that Turok2?

Well maybe people wouldn't pirate if movies weren't upwards of $30-$50 upon release, and games weren't $60 for a new/used game and an expansion for a game is about the same.

It's funny how they find a place with like minded individuals here on reddit and even online people give them shit just because they don't know that you can remove something from your front page.  Even if they weren't on the front page, just by existing they'd still have to put up with the grief.  Just like in real life.
Sounds like you really don't want to go to that party.
I have found numerous users on YouTube that upload the series in parts (3,4,5 parts), or post the episodes in whole. It may take a few minutes to find them, but i can guarantee that all episodes are on there in whole, but perhaps by different users. It may be a pain, but at least there's the original music. If you're not too picky about the music, and just want easy access w/o buying the DVDs, try Hulu. They have all 6 series. Hope that helps.

Yo baby right on.  Let me add... I have some nice, high-tech, variable voltage wands, with dozens of tiny machined parts and some microelectronics and amazing colored plexi and state-of-the-art machining, and I was holding one in my hand the other day admiring it. I was admiring the chrome ring at the base of my clearo, and looking at a scuff on it, and thinking, damn, I scuffed the chrome. WHAT? Suddenly I remembered that the entire friggin' clearo, complete with plastic "chrome", cost me a whole $5. My mind was temporarily blown. It's very artful extreme-low-cost manufacturing, and for the cost of the hardware, it's insanely reliable. Even though I have some dead units lying around.  I will also be acquiring nice "pieces" for artful vaping, but also let us all appreciate that 2012 gave us some AMAZING and GORGEOUS tech, for pittance. Really, for the cost of a business lunch for two, you can be carrying a vv rubberized battery in designer colors, a matched kanger 2+ml clearo with rebuildable internals, and an anodized mouthpiece with a blisteringly perfect finish, full of a hand-mixed wonder juice with controllable nicotine content. And also, this industry has more standard fittings than most new gadget industries in the last many years. Huge interchangeability. Yes, briefly, mind was blown there.  Other hobbies, you can't get squat for $5. For instance, it's hard to find any kind of cheap plastic crap in a music store, for the cost of a Kanger, except for finger picks maybe. The pricing in this market, compared to the quality of product, continues to amaze me. It's a pretty inexpensive hobby, from my perspective.  I myself would like a Provari-style vw unit with a bit more weight and personality. I can't wait for 2013!

There will be specials at every bar in town - Gold Standard is doing stuff, T&amp;P has a dinner going on with drinks... just look around.
Ok, first, how do you know she wants to be better than us? There's no reason or hostility there.  And second, who *does* want to be human? When there are thousands of other fantasy and real things out there, who the hell would want to stay a human. While being an anime character wouldn't be bad, I'd honestly be some type of Seraph or Halfling if I had the choice.  But we know that won't ever happen.

For some reason I am unable to up vote you, so I will reply instead. Thank you for sharing this link. I appreciate the radical feminist perspective on gender. And I agree that gender (and prescribed gender roles) are a cornerstone of female oppression, and that smashing gender is a key step to smashing patriarchal oppression of women. I am increasingly annoyed at the way radical feminist writing is deemed hateful or phobic by those who simply don't like what is being said. What's more, those who don't like it but cannot counter with facts, then often attempt to shame and silence women with emotionally manipulative sentences like "this is not supportive". So what?  Vital and important analysis, criticism and disagreement does not equal hate. Sheesh. Love your username!!

I don't see what's wrong with companies extending their copyright on the work they create with their staff. They have every right to make money on it. How would you feel if you created something widely popular and your copyright ran out. Everyone else in the world can now steal all your potential profits and you'll be left with nothing.
Alright, I'm watching the bounty hunter one right now, but here's some starting thoughts:   * You actually seem to be doing very well.  Now, we can place some of the blame on your teammates' horrible, horrible item builds (3 ultimate orbs warlock, no boots sk)... but this is about you.  Your item builds seem ok, the only two things I don't like are the basher on dk (You'll be fighting mostly in your dragon form, and basher's effectiveness is reduced there), and the battlefury on bh (Very, very situational).  Note: I assume you want advice on gameplay, not necessarily item/skills builds as those are situational and you learn them as you play?

There is a strong argument that taking actions which negatively affects the sales of a product is unethical. The thing is, you still have to show that the action is doing that. Pirating instead of buying something is unethical. Pirating instead of just not buying something, it's much harder to show that that's unethical. You have to start account for things like people's lack of ability to know whether or not they would have bought something if piracy wasn't an option, and stranger things beyond that.
But then his argument becomes invalid when, instead of playing for only two hours, he goes on a 10 hour Skyrim binge.

First, you completely avoided my point about cj. Second, a bias is an unreasonable outlook on something. The only bias here is yours against Peyton. If your only reason that brees should have won MVP is because People bias Peyton, then that in its self is truly bias. Peyton has earned the right to be considered in the MVP race. Obviously after yesterday AP deserves it, but he has still earned the rift to be in the discussion.

WHY ARE THERE MOVING DOTS ON THE SCREEN?!  I had friends that were very allergic to MSG, but I think they were the exception.  They were a family who was allergic to nearly everything.  I chalk MSG sensitivity to the same thing gluten sensitivity is; a fad.  Some people genuinely have problems with gluten, but currently it's mostly a cultural meme that people will forget.  Think about it; 10 year ago you couldn't pick up a magazine without someone warning about MSG or complaining that it gave them cancer or something.  Now you almost never hear about the dangers of it. Give it another 10 years, and people will barely remember what all the hype was about.
Older champions need help in general BECAUSE of Flash's dominance.  I wish they'd just nerf flash right out of the game instead of balancing it. I've been saying, for over a year now, that flash is so crazy that the only way to have it be properly balanced is if it's ludicrously weak without aid.  Giving it a 5 minute cooldown (while making it's cooldown lower at the cost of something, such as mobility or survivabiltiy) makes it much more situational and thusly, as step in the right direction. It also makes it much less likely to counter *itself*.
Then they're bad and were taught to spar against armored targets, using padded legs. Sports TKD and combat TKD are two different things.  Also, generally anyone who starts the fight is usually bad, so unless you went out of your way to find someone who's specifically good, you wouldn't see a good demonstration of it.   Sampling bias, you know what I mean? TKD has the most possibility for being stupid in a fight out of the traditional martial arts, so it gets a lot of bad rep, but that's more of the sampling bias talking.

I just love the kind of rush from it you can't get from established love relationships. On the other hand, established love relationships are really unbeatable with the right person because casual no strings sex could  be totally empty if that's all there was.  I guess the thing that surprised me was how alive I felt when I had that kind of physical encounter because of the newness of it.  The feeling of being wanted by someone new.  I think the haters will have trouble understanding this idea, but it's how I feel

Look for the first season of New Yankee Workshop and accompanying book.  Individual projects are available online.  The projects in that book may be beyond what you are interested in but in that first season the focus was on learning to build.  Some techniques require tools you may not have. Others will indicate how you might do certain tasks without a fully complete shop. Later seasons are harder to recommend as the projects become more involved and the tool requirements more serious.   Also see if you can find video of The Woodwright's Shop with Roy Underhill. This is a seriously more traditional approach to building things using only hand tools. Maybe not up your alley, especially project wise, but it does reinforce understanding that for years all of it was done by hand. So with a little practice, you don't need a million dollar shop.   That's where I kindled my interest in building.

Why should firefight matter? The majority of WWII was bombing or submarine fighting btw.  &gt;He may argue that authority was given to him under wartime powers, but wartime powers are not sufficient to allow you to ignore due process.   Due process does not apply to overseas, it does not apply to military action, it is not relevant. It amazes me that libertarians who tend to reject substantive due process in the U.S. apply it to war.

Nice junk. 
**Beginning**  I started studying lucid dreaming a few years ago after hearing about it some where. I became a member on DreamViews and began reading more and more about lucid dreaming. I started my first dream journal around that time. After a few days, I had my first lucid dream. It was short and I didn't do much, but I wanted to get better.  Now that I had my first lucid dream, I began to study more and more. All of my internet time was dedicated to reading about lucid dream induction techniques, keywords/terms, reality checks, etc. I spent a lot of my time reading other dreamers' dream journals and their lucid dreaming experiences. They kept me interested in lucid dreaming so I wouldn't give up.  **Dream Journaling**  After my first month, I was able to have one, short lucid dream a week or even two if I was lucky. I kept up with my dream journal and did reality checks through out the day. My normal dreams weren't very detailed and they were short.  As I kept writing in it over the past year, my dreams were long and took up two pages sometimes. They were very clear, vivid, and movie-like. While I was dreaming, perception of dream time was noticeable. For example, if the plot of a dream lasted a dream day, my mind made it feel   it had been a day. It didn't actually feel like a day passed, it was more like when someone asks what you did today, you tell them from when you got up and what you did from that point until now. You're going through each event that leads up to present time, but you aren't experiencing it. My longer lucid dreams feel like this. It's kind of hard for me to explain.  **Lucid dream experiences**  After two years, I started having lucid dreams at least 5 times a week. They would last around 10 seconds to maybe 10 minutes. Now, after 5 years, my dreams can last up to 30+ minutes when I use DEILD to get back into a lucid dream after waking (I can only guess how long a lucid dream lasts). Vividness ranged from cloudy to extremely realistic, but control was always a problem for me. My first problems of control was over my dream body. I had trouble running fast and sometimes couldn't see. I found that when I ran on all fours, I would run much faster. I also took a liking to shapeshifting in dreams around this time. So whenever I wanted to run fast, I would transform into a wolf or a cheetah. I don't have problems running on just two anymore, but I still run on all fours every once in a while because it's fun.  I had trouble flying for the longest time too. At first, the best I could do was a huge jump and soar for a little bit before crash landing. Earlier this year, I realized the way I learned how to run faster was to transform into something that can run fast. In one lucid dream I had, I was stuck in a creepy lab where some crazy scientists were doing experiments on people and I wanted to get away. I didn't want to confront the scientists so I transformed into an Eastern dragon and flew through the ceiling. Now when I fly, I transform into an Eastern dragon. It became easier to fly (sometimes) and the feeling of having a long body feels really strange, but it's one of the reasons why I prefer transforming into an Eastern dragon other than the Western kind.   In one of the first lucid dreams I've had, I began looking for my dream guide. One of my first experiences with dream characters wasn't pleasant. I was calling for my dream guide and I hear a voice tell me to turn around. When I did, a man tackled me and put into a headlock. There were two other guys with him and they just laugh and leave me there. I was confused of what just happened, so I sat there for a while thinking about what to do next.  In another lucid dream, I met dream character that was dressed in a hooded, black robe and he said that he knew who my dream guide was. A few days later, I had a regular dream where he introduced himself and told me to call him PJ. He had short, red hair and was wearing some sort of uniform. He told me he was part of an organization and he took me to its headquarters once, but I don't remember what they do. PJ became a common part of my lucid and non-lucid dreams.  A few weeks later in a different lucid dream, I start calling for PJ, but a with black hair shows up. I tell him that he's not PJ and he says that his name is also PJ. When the PJ I knew showed up, he and the black haired PJ started hanging out. The black haired PJ became friends with red haired PJ and they would both show up when I called for either of them. After a while, I asked if they can change their names for me. Red haired PJ is now know as Jacob and black haired PJ is Michael. The last time I saw them, Michael had joined Jacob's organization and was wearing their uniform. I haven't seen them in a long time because of having less lucid dreams, but I'm sure that once I start having them regularly again, I will begin to see them more often.  I met my dream guide by summoning a door and saying I will meet my dream guide when I go through it. I entered a room that had three dogs in it, two were german shepherds and one looked like a bermese mountain dog. The shepherds were very friendly and the other dog began speaking to me. I asked it if it was my dream guide and it said yes. The dog transformed into a woman with long, curly, brown hair. I don't remember much about her other than that she told me her name was Ann and that she was very nice. The two german shepherds also transformed into humans, but I don't remember them. Then suddenly, the walls break apart and a large, flying machine zaps her with some sort of lightning transfer beam. A man's voice comes from the machine and tells me that he was taking her. Jacob was disappointed that I didn't do anything to help her. I think I had a non-lucid dream where Jacob, Michael, and I rescue her from the man inside the machine, but I don't remember much of it. One thing I remember from the dream though was that Jacob and Ann was in a relationship.  **Nightmares**  After about three years, I started getting lucid nightmares where I couldn't do anything. My lack of control along with in-dream sleep paralysis began to make lucid dreaming scary instead of fun. After a while, I wanted to quit lucid dreaming all together. I stopped writing in my dream journal and stopped encouraging myself to have lucid dreams. After about a year, my recall slowly dropped to where it was in the beginning and I rarely lucid dreamed at all.  I'm getting back into lucid dreaming now because I'm not afraid to take on the scary stuff anymore. I'm trying to get back into writing in my dream journal, but I'm being lazy about it. I'm starting to get lucid dreams again at about one every other day by DILDing and using DEILD when I can. My control has gotten better because I realized that imagination is extremely important when you want something to work in dreams. So when I imagine something to happen, it happens. Right now I'm working on achieving lucid dreams as often as I used to and get better control over my lucid dreams.

Helping people you know was the underlying force behind the "invisible hand" where man naturally does for the good of his neighbors because they all live in the same neighborhood.  That's no longer a reality in today's world where the owners of large companies have often never set foot in factories they own abroad, nor have they even met a room filled with customers.  "Those people" live outside the gates.

You are actually in a dialogue with yourself at such a time, and who better to discuss these things with? 
Acquiring them is..hrm. how to put this..  It's not hard, but its not reliable. Items in d3 are randomly generated, so for the same amount of effort you might get something worth $1000 or something worth $0.001.   If you get good, you can start killing more things more quickly and efficiently so you get more potential good drops per hour, and thus maximize your return.  I don't know if I'd call that hard to do though, really a lot of it is about having the right gear and just looking up good routes to take or builds to use.   Overall I do think the value now is lower than it was earlier on, but they're about to release a patch that adds player vs player combat, so I anticipate a spike in prices when that happens as people come back, get their ass handed to them, and want to spend $40 to get the gear they need to do well.

FOR MED PTs: SeaTac/TSA have said that they will leave you alone if you have your authorization with you.  Now whether you will be hassled at your arrival airport depends on whether or not that state is a reciprocal state (although from what I hear from many who have flown, as long as you fly out safely you are probably fine since there is no search at the arrival port).  TSA's official policy for cannabis is to refer it to the local state enforcement.    See [this article](http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2011/11/seatac_tsa_agents_you_are_free.php) from last year regarding flying with it at Seatac.     &gt;Elliott checked with Sea-Tac spokesperson Charla Scaggs on the airport's official policy for prescribed pot coming through security. He said "I don't see a problem, as long as they have a doctor's authorization."   Now if you are not a medical patient I have no idea how you would be treated.

Thanks for the comment and advice, I actually have let 2 guys know I was interested in them before... but both of those just ended up in disaster. The first guy was nice about it and said he was unsure, but later on it turned out that he was just using me to get closer to my friend. The second guy just reacted negatively and that was a crash and burn failure.  You know, a lot of people do say that we have the power to change that and whatnot... but honestly it really doesn't happen to everyone :\. Not to suddenly sound all pessimistic or anything but it's just so tiring. I've tried wearing makeup, dressing better, etc... And yet it still feels like no matter where I go I just don't have any luck, and it's just so frustrating.  But, it's not like I'm going to go out right now and cut off all my hair and join a convent, so I suppose there's always that small, faint glimmer of hope.

A lot of it is Jon struggling with the Bible. He doesn't consider himself a Christian yet he reads the Bible and feels God calling him (Jon refers to Him several times as "my God"). Being a man of violence he finds it hard to reconcile the the teachings of Jesus with the realities of living in a world where outlaws run free and terrorise innocent people. The following quote sums it up well: "I am trapped, Batik, in a religion I can scarcely comprehend. In the Bible there are many passages I can follow, yet I am not a Christian. My Bible teaches me to smite the enemy hip and thigh, destroy him with fire and sword... it also teaches me to love my enemy and do good to him who hates me."  The book I remember the best (and the above quote is from) is Wolf in Shadow. It deals a lot with Jon's inner conflict, the problem of evil, peace, redemption, and justice.

Sorry I got confused. I mean Ba is probably going to be a 'interim striker' for only a few years until a replacement comes along(Chelsea seem to love those). Waiting for Lukaku or another young player to be ready for the first team, or waiting to buy another top striker that is better than Ba, and then he'll probably be sold on.

&gt;I'm not saying that people who tell girls to smile are Hitler - I'm saying that judging people just on their intentions makes everyone equally awesome and is consequently a pointless metric.  I'm not saying that it's a good metric either. All I am suggesting is you try and have a little perspective. I'm not even saying that some of the stuff that has been brought up isn't a good point, just that wishing someone was happy is a hell of a long way from genocide.  I don't think most of the guys are thinking "Hey, it's hard for me to get a boner with this girls chronic bitch face, maybe if I tell her to smile she'll suck my dick."   When someone tells me to smile, I am not always in the mood. So I don't smile. I don't fucking rage about it. Life's too short for dumb shit.  &gt;Hilarious. I'm a male, not in any way personally affected by women being told to smile.  It is hilarious because when I said 'you people' I wasn't referring to women. If I had mean't women, I'd have typed that.  A) I don't believe all or even most women (or men) would react that negatively to such a harmless thing.  B) I had already seen your other posts of your sour puss, and I knew you were a guy.  C) It's fewer letters.  &gt;It's because I am empathising with women who are sick to fucking death of being told to smile by douchebags that we're having this conversation.  Oh, yes. What a horrible thing to say to someone. Literally Hitler.

I like slightly bad teeth too and I don't think this is it. I think it's because a tiny flaw can make someone more human and relatable. Think Miranda Lawson from Mass Effect. The designers knew that giving her crooked teeth would make her cuter.

Anyway, just saying that I kind of enjoy having to drive to a different country to buy pants that actually fit me.

I got in a ranked game with this guy around 1500 elo a few days (maybe a week) ago.  He took the name, but said he would give it back for some cash moneys.  Not sure if he was joking (hard to pick up on sarcasm online), but he didn't seem to be a bad guy, just a fan.  Aphro can probably get the name back.

Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 may keep speeds up. But I think fundamentally it will be hard to select the external drive to install on and boot from.   Maybe look at rEFIt and installing Win7 off of a USB. Try this http://liza.io/installing-windows-7-through-boot-camp-with-no-optical-drive-on-a-mac-mini/  but when asked for the install drive in Win7 install see if you can select the external?  Best idea I have.

I think your devil's advocate applies differently to different people. I'm all for equality, but a relationship to me is a partnership. Two people banding together to face the world. It was a huge source of argument in that relationship. He was looking for someone who was vastly independent, and to be honest, that's not me. I can be independent. I lived on my own for many years after turning 18, without monetary support from anyone but myself. But when I am with someone in a committed relationship, I would rather be a part of a team. Lucky for me, I have that now. When my fiancé stands up for me, I don't see it as treating me like a child. But to each their own. I'm sure my relationship setup would drive someone else completely mad.

Sounds to me like you should try another desktop enviroment or install a better video driver than the one you are using. What video chipset does your laptop have?  Right off the bat I can tell you Lubuntu runs pretty awesome on any video chipset if you want it to run lean and mean. Or you can just 'sudo apt-get install lxde' then switch the session to lxde in the login screen. I had that same issue myself until I installed the official Nvidia driver from the 'software sources' app (I have an nvidia gtx 670m so I used the latest testing driver) instead of using the opensource driver that automatically is used when you install. If you use an AMD/Radeon video chip, I would investigate what the best driver for your specific chip would be.

* The bugs you find open in any tracker with an ad-hoc query are open because they're hard to reproduce, or hard to analyze, or hard to fix, or unimportant (not worth the hassle). * Reading code is *way* harder than writing code. Transforming your idea into an architecture / design, and then coding it up, is much easier than parsing someone else's code and reconstructing their design. Documentation is scarce and outdated. Don't bother except if you're super-interested in a problem/feature and can put in extreme hours. * Most mainstream programs are pretty stable and reliable in most use cases. Common bugs are triggered by swaths of people and fixed early. * Upstreams hate gratuitous refactoring second to none, because it can introduce bugs without any intended improvement and it obsoletes everyone's working knowledge of the code structure. Refactoring patches sneak in inside patch series that add a feature or fix long standing (eg. design) bugs.

Fair enough. Reasonable response. I guess this I found your original response interesting because of the question of experience and attention. Do people at the extremes *truly* care *more* about height of their SO because height-relations are brought to their attention more often, and it's a bigger part of their overall human experience? Your "ideal" range is fairly broad in relation to your height, and would seem to indicate that it really doesn't matter that much.

Hospice nurse here, curious to hear from the crowd.  This article raises some big questions for me -- particularly with regard to the definition of addiction in the article.  I was taught that there is a difference between tolerance, dependence and addiction -- the last being an issue when someone is either hurting themselves or others in order to continue the addictive behavior.  I was also taught (and have witnessed) that you can't just stop opioids cold turkey.  So the premises of the article seem to be off.  Having said that, I have a gut feeling that there's some substance to the claim that a higher number of people get addicted than the standard 2 - 3% so often cited.  But no evidence!  On the flip side, it's sort of common hospice knowledge that many doctors do not prescribe pain medicine appropriately.  I can certainly attest to this from personal experience as a patient, when I was sent home after an ORIF of the clavicle with a boatload of Percocets, and plain ocycodone for breakthrough.  (Oh, and no bowel regimen!  A hospice nurse's anathema.)  This apparently was standard practice!!!  WTF??  I think I used 4 - 5 percocets, tops, and none of the oxycodone. With no buzz, by the way -- which brings up another issue -- ; the conventional wisdom has historically been that various substances were not initially considered addictive when they were first synthesized in the lab and the scientists took them, themselves.  But when they were released to the general public, much addiction ensued.  (Can't remember which drugs, now... would have to do some googling.)  ANYWAY, would love to hear any input / feedback / thoughts from the folks here.
It's true, cuntrag. :(

I partially have to disagree, FFL's in my area will add 25 to 50 bucks to a straight transfer. Which means you would be increasing the cost of the gun by quite a bit. If you are talking about a used gun that might be worth $200, that would be quite the upcharge.  Not to mention that you are now limited to store hours, and store locations.  I am not saying that a seller does not have any options available now but there is obviously still a market for private sales. The option you mention, that they do not chose to utilize, does not come without significant cost, hence my idea of providing the option free of charge.   As I am sure you know, the gun community is very adverse to any and all fees or surcharges....hence dealers will charge you even for the tiny credit card fees they have to pay.  Why the resistance to offering an additional option, I dont see any downside.....if I am missing something, let me know. I am open to suggestions.

Technical issues with computer and making a video. I became a fan, I think partly because I grew up in the 80's and everybody loved the Turtles. It was a fun cartoon that I watched every afternoon. My favorite Turtle is of course Mikey. Although I didn't have a clear favorite in the first cartoon, reading the comic(the originals) I grew to really love Mikey and his cat Klunk and his writings. I was always introverted and shy and liked Donnie also. My favorite movie has to be the first one, although I love the new CGI one and the 2nd is a guilty pleasure. The movie really brought the cartoon to life and I was only 9 or 10 at the time and watched it almost every day when I got my VHS copy. My favorite item, although it's not available anymore is the pudding pie. I also ate the cereal but never really liked it(still had to eat it because it was turtles!) I have a new Mikey figure that I cherish also. To Turtles fans: It's so cool that we are now the second generation of Turtles fans and young kids are getting their own new series and new comic as well. 
Yeah, my families like that.

Never have I seen the spelling of a word in the english butchered so badly.  Somewhere, her second grade teacher -the one who taught her spelling class, is crying quietly and pouring herself another shot of cheap vodka.
It's all in the wording. Here you're essentially saying "I tried my hardest to care, but you were just too fucking boring".  Try something like "I'm sorry, I couldn't keep up. The topic doesn't interest me. (I don't have a large enough attention span).
Okay, A Stupid Abortion Opinion.  I'm assuming what I think is the general view for each side of the debate, pro-choice or pro-life.  Specifically, I think most pro-choicers agree with Roe v. Wade that all abortions before the third trimester should be legal.  And on the other side that most pro-lifers, motivated by religion, believe that a soul gets magically inserted into a fetus at conception.  (I think this is fair to say generally, though I know some people have more varied opinions.)  First of all, a person who declares abortion "murder" is probably immovable on this point.  I think the best way to suss that out is to ask them what they believe should be the penalty for a woman who has an illegal abortion and for the doctor who performs it.  If they answer that the penalty should be the same as for murder, then the debate is probably pointless.  You can't prove they are wrong about a fetus having a soul.  The best you can do is try to convince them that they'll never win on abortion politically and maybe they should turn their attention to a fight they can actually win.  You can *try* to convince them that we can't legislate based on religious belief, but that argument is going to go down the "CHRISTIAN NATION!" shithole pretty fast.  If they answer anything less than whatever the penalty is for murder, then I assert that they do not genuinely believe that a fetus has the same value as a one month old baby.  Now you've got some ground to work with.  The question now becomes a matter of what is more valuable morally, and you can get into all those rape and health of the mother questions.  But what's happened here with all this rape/health-of-the-mother debate?  Pro-choicers are conceding ground just by arguing this point because they (generally) believe that abortion should be a choice no matter the circumstances.  What's the point of arguing this?  Even if you win this argument, all you've done is convinced the pro-life person that we should make some exceptions for abortions.  That's fine, I guess, but it's not the pro-choice position.  So what the fuck is my point anyway?  My point is don't argue with them because you can't prove them wrong.  Instead, try to find some common ground.  Acknowledge, for example, that nobody could morally stomach seeing an eight-month fetus terminated for no reason, pro-life OR pro-choice.  So pro-choicers also have a line they draw that says, "This fetus is a person right here."  Pro-lifers simply put that line all the way at the beginning.  The common ground you can find is ways to prevent abortions that don't include making them illegal.  These are arguments that can be won on reasonable merits, like better sex education and availability of contraception.  The "abortion is murder" argument cannot be won, most of the time.
You're joking, right? 
I'd say he's closer to Clockwerk with great nukes and no cc, as Undying is almost solely played as a tanky teamfight/utility hero, where Timber is an item dependent ganker. Clockwerk isn't particularly item dependent but doesn't scale much with farm either, so Timbersaw is a much better hero in most cases.
