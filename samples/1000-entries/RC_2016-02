That doesn't seem like enough. Why only three years? Fucker beat a woman so hard she lost her baby, that should count as a murder charge. 
What theme is that?
**Izumi Okazaki**  As the man reached out to grab his wrist, Izumi quickly adjusted the trajectory of his attack, ending his swipe abruptly in a shorter swing which did not hit the ghoul, but put the sword in front of him and brought his arm out of his reach. The reason as to why he was close to the ground was so to make himself a smaller target and make it possible to block Ukaku shards with his swords, which he quickly turned sideways and put side-to-side in front of himself. Although a few of them made some cuts along his arms and shoulder, drawing some blood, none hit square-on, crashing against the rinkaku quinque. He didn't stop his momentum even after that and quickly dove below the wing, turning around to face the ghoul's back and slashing with both of his swords from down-up, one at the wing which had just shot and other at the ghouls left leg, counting on the spikes to make some damage.

Depending how much muscle you'd like to keep on its better to do interval training by going hard for shorter periods for like 30 min then a longer cardiovascular workout. Alot of bodybuilders use the stair machine hard for 30 min to get their heart rate way up its a great way to burn fat without losing muscle. If you're trying to lose weight more then gain muscle just do whatever type of cardiovascular I'd your thing   Example  workout after your list to go on your cardiovascular machine of choice ( I've read the bike  and stairs are best for not losing muscle) and go hard for 4-7 minutes take a 30 second -1 minute break then go again and keep that up for half an hour. Another one is to just straight up go hard at about 80% of your maximum sprint and go till you can't take a short breather when you need to and do that for 20-30 minutes. 
Lube your ass before you shit.

Yes, those are what I use, but I usually get an off brand. I just blot my nose whenever I go to the restroom at work. I don't have blackheads though, so I can't help with those. I've seen from a lot of other posts on this subreddit that the oil cleansing method (OCM) is great for stuff like that, so you might look into that.
Because I will help you without wanting something in return. I feel that is a trait in people that is in short supply today.
Objectively, saying "Ok." to a post asking for advice on playing Rammus is toxic. The guy wants to improve and he sees others memeing for karma isntead of helping him. If I was the OP I would feel horrible.

Not sure what games your focused on, but if they are team games make sure you stress the benefits associated with working as a group in a team game. Talk about the fact that as a group you have to think quickly and solve problems while working together. There are lessons in that.  Additionally, I'd recommend some other things that will be beneficial to the school and your own development. Two suggestions would be to have your team / club organize some charity work. Something easy and topical would be a 24-hour or 48-hour marathon gaming session some weekend for charity. If you have your meeting and indicate that you have plans for something like this, it makes it harder to reject. Plus it will be great for you guys for future resumes. A second idea on the "personal growth" topic could be a regular meeting (once a week or once a month based on how much your club gets together) to discuss the business of eSports. Maybe have some speakers talk to you guys, or do some research on the business behind the games you love. It would be hard for a school to be against a club that is looking to do charity work and help their members build their business knowledge. All great prep for future jobs, resumes and college applications!  Good luck, I hope it works out!
Wait there is 2 game threads
We had one of those. People kept saying "BUT THIS THING I MADE ISN'T LOW QUALITY".  It also leads to the question "Who decides what 'low quality' is?" and "Can a video be a high quality production, but still a shitpost?"
Sure thing!
Dude the last time Bungo gave us numbers they were off by a factor of 10 to a 100( I am talking about the auto rifle "buff").   There is probably one guy who actually *understands* the numbers and is in charge of the spreadsheet. The rest of them probably just know a gun "feels" good and gives feedback to the spreadsheet man.   Heck, the person in charge of drawing the bars for the weapon stats can't get it right!
Yeah, they only want a competent mánager, one who wasn't hired because he's friends with the owner, and one that maaaaaybe has a shot at winning at least one game in the league. What assholes!
Or it can also be that some gurus are almost like creative writers - they can draw together lots of different writings and philosophies and formulate their own unique take that can resonate with people particularly if they are charismatic. It doesn't mean they are awakened at all. I guess you just need to take the bits that strike a chord with you and try it out.

People will notice the successful games of the future will make their game without worrying about how to monetize their cash shop. The last few years, scummy companies preyed on ignorance, but people are getting wiser to this shit.

I talked to a friend who owns a couple Chinese restaurants in the area and basically: there's zero demand for real Chinese or even good Chinese food. Customer bases are so accustomed to what is essentially fast food in Chinese wrappers that they almost revolt (or at least vote with their wallets) when a place tries something different.  Basically, SE Michigan's tastes for what Chinese food should be are extremely low-bar and the businesses cater to it.   In her own words, "I can make home-cooked authentic food and serve it. Nobody orders it. If I suggest it or get people to try it, they don't like it. 90% of my customers order the same thing every time, either ABC or Orange Chicken or General Tso. That's what they want. They want chicken mcnuggets on rice, so that's what I make."  And she ain't wrong. Her restaurants are doing just fine.
I know you're probably having quite a laugh but I don't get people like you. How cynical are you? People on reddit act like there's no one on Earth who's ever been successful or gotten lucky. You know how many people can kick 60 yard field goals? A decent amount. I just felt like I'd chime in and let him know that he was correct in his assumption because I know first hand. When someone comes on reddit and gives legal advice, do you say "I'm sure you're really a lawyer /s"? No, you just believe him. How come I can't have the ability to kick a 60 yard field goal, or that the coach happened to be there? It's not such a strange occurrence or something that hard to believe. You just have to jump on the opportunity to make your little meme joke work. I've had sex with one girl my whole life and I was a very successful athlete. I won most athletic in my school. Are you having a hard time believe that there's someone on Earth that can achieve a slightly noteworthy thing? Fuck off, honestly. I hate the cynicism on this website. This is why people just lurk.

Because your gear only helps you to raid.  you should not play for  gear but play for raid. How would you kill end  game content with 130 ilvl?  and it would be boring if end game bosses never got any more challenging , so by increasing the required ilvl, at start you will struggle as you are lower than the required ilvl which means the more you play and progress the easier over time it'll be.   so yeah. definitely screw gear, go for the raids.

Mine is an ellipse that moves counter clockwise. I picture the months as blocks; months that are 31 days are a little wider. Feb is the thinnest.

There is a nice theory about the respawn system meaning that the mercenarie in the comics are not really you but the original mercenarie and you are just clone of them, hat and cosmetic are made because clone had identity crisis and of course the room you respawn is actually a complex machine made by The engineer.   The respawn theorie is the name i guess

Stop getting butthurt over cheetolords that don't like what you like.  Seriously though, why are all of those ledditors jerking themselves off that the rack they hang their clothes on costs more than the clothes itself? It's not that they don't have an outfit that matches the pre-approved streetwear wardrobe, it's shit like this:  &gt; I wear sweatpants, long johns, graphic t-shirt, sweater, and a turtle neck 10 days straight  i mean what the fuck that's just unhygenic   but i bet they wouldn't have a problem blowing more than $2600 on a ebin vidya PC that you will have to completely reupgrade in a year and a half anyway because video games are so much better than clothes  regardless you guys are some insecure fucks because i'm assuming it's you guys in there defending muh streetwear and making the pile of shit bigger while upvoting this. saying "d-don't worry about other people's decisions with their money" then turning around and shitting on them for not liking bape or some other stupid shit because y'all can't take any criticism of your interests
People shitting on Dubnyk for that last one, really?

He likely is referring to Macronutrients.  I like the app so far! It's clean, easy to use, and looks really good. My only concern is with being able to search recipes later on more easily. When I cook, I personally like to plan out what I'm having when, and group them based on meal. It'd be nice if your app had some kind of categorical view once your recipes get numerous enough to require it.
That makes no sense. Why wouldn't they instantly pause the game instead of letting the entire round play out?  That's completely mental.

I've been wanting to purchase moclobemide for quite awhile now. I'm really glad it's helping you. I'm going to do some more research and try to solidify some reputable vendors that're hopefully cheaper and closer, as you typed. I'll keep you apprised!   side note: how long have you been on it? dissolving those petty&amp;pestering anxieties is something I so deeply want to do. if I end up getting it, I hope I benefit from its effects like you are. I know that's a great feeling to feel finally cured {or at least substantially better}—I've had other substances do the same for me for sure! I'm siked for ya
in some sense you are both right. e6 cuts out stupid crap like the fried liver attack, and does a good job of safeguarding f7 so you don't often lose in 8 moves or something...  I've even had little kids play me and the game goes 1. e4 e6 2 Bc4 d5 3 Be3?  Their one big plan is for some sort of quick mate, and when that isn't working they are at sea right away.   in that sense, especially for a sub 1200 player, it might be a very safe opening. (even with the exchange variation, which tries to give a symmetrical open position feel, black can castle quickly and many of the most tender points are safer than e4 e5...  on the other hand... in many french structures, that pawn on e5 stops a knight from being on f6 where it would love to be. The natural pawn formation with everything being closed gives white an awful lot of play against black's king where black has alot of chances against the queenside.   If black can survive the attack against the king, the superior structure often gives a nice advantage for the endgame. The attacks of course aren't always survived.  there's an FM where i used to play who said it took balls of steel to play the french defense successfully.

I feel almost exactly the same way as you do. I have done extensive research into my real (adoptive) parents lines, and enjoyed that a lot. My parents both loved seeing their past, and don't have the technical skills to do the research. Plus my Mom is a direct descendant of someone important to American/New England History, so that made the research really really cool. I have found Mom some cousins she didn't know before, and the physical resemblance is amazing. All in all, has been a really cool journey.  But, as I love doing research and have a newfound love of family trees, I decided to do some DNA testing, which led me to figure out who my Birth Mother is. I had a fun time doing her side's tree. I'm narrowing in on my birth father, and I'll do his too. I enjoyed the digging through old documents, putting the puzzle together, but I did it in kind of a detached way. It never really felt like my family, more like I was doing a close friends tree.  Like you, I actually feel more of a connection doing my (adoptive) parents trees. That history is what made my parents who they are, and are the family I identify with. My entire (adoptive) family embraced me fully, that may have something to do with it. Cheers Kindred Spirit! :)

Let's take the money out of this for a second.  You and your fiance are still talking past each other, and not *to* each other. Given the disparity in income and all that it entails, counseling on multiple levels (financial and personal) is entirely appropriate and necessary. Y'all need to learn how to communicate respectfully and understand where the other person is coming from.  Right now, that's just not happening.
Did you transfer the points?  If so, why use the old one again? It's probably marked as "stolen" - if the technology in it is advanced enough to ID it (I somehow don't think so...).

You just can't win if you play by the rules though, how would you get your message out there if you go through the channels of CNN/MSNBC/Fox, and they refuse to allow you to speak.  Trump is a genius circumventing them, Sanders should honestly do the same.
I have been running for years. However recently i started a job whrrr im constantly on my feet. I walk 10 miles a day before i get to run and im physically and mentally exhausted. I put in 29 miles instead of my usual 50 this week. Im just thrilled i did my long run
I think it'd be interesting to see how/if they change their tactics if Clinton were to win the primary and then general elections. Chances are that you're right but we only know that republicans have viciously opposed Obama's presidency - it's possible that they're more receptive to a new president that's also been a longtime colleague.   I left Sanders out because I think his vision is such that many (on both sides) would try to railroad him every step of the way.

Great question. I think the short answer to your question is basically no, there's nothing really as effective as prescription antidepressants except maybe exercise but not even. I know that is a sucky answer and I wish you could get some great miracle drug as your answer instead.  Would you be interested in sharing with us why you want something nonprescription instead of getting a prescription from a doctor?

Thnx for the suggestion.   i just downloaded html5ify extension and it seems to be working.  which is a huuuge relief for me since flash the flash plugin seemed to crash non stop.  it wasnt native for me (i do have all the current browsers/win 10)  so i did have to download it.  lol i spent so much time trying to uninstall/disable flash player in the hopes that it fall back to html5.  but once i downloaded the extension the 6pt ncrave is working perfectly :)

It wasn't intentional. The opening of a new office was purely the result of physical forces.  Many might not know this but Derby represents a near total vacuum; No light, no sound, no art, no culture. And since the universe abhors a vacuum, as CIG gained mass a small portion of it got sucked into the void.
Those Ashad who escape from the city make their way south, mainly going through the countryside but occasionally taking major roads.  Being short of road supplies due to the circumstances behind their departure, many of the retreating Ashad soldiers form small warbands, robbing caravans or even using intimidation and raids to get food and water from small settlements along the way.  Those (relatively few) who manage the river crossing journey the rest of the way toward Konome for a rendezvous with the Ashad garrison there.

Off topic, rehosted content and idiotic.  Relatives of political figures are usually deemed 'off topic' here by the mods, unless they're conservatives.

I appreciate your reply.  I have met Raheel Raza and she is anti-Islamist (political Islam), not anti-Islam. She is a devout Sunni Muslim.  What you say is her "*ban on immigration and mosque-building*" is a vast oversimplification.  She opposes foreign funding of mosques in Canada by sources like Saudi Arabia that seek to spread their radical Wahhabi dogma.  She is also against organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood that want to bring back the caliphate. Their motto: *"Allah is our objective; the Prophet is our leader; the Quran is our law; Jihad is our way; dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope"*. - No room for democracy there! Your characterization of the MRM as *"simply spout slogans without a critical stance"* seems ironic to me.  These are some of the only people in the Muslim community that seem genuinely open to critical scrutiny of Islam and how it is affecting the world today.  The people spouting slogans are the apologists on the left and the demagogues on the right.  WRT some of the 'reformist' that you mentioned, I'm familiar with some of these folks, particularly Tariq Ramadan.  He tends to say different things to different audiences so find hard to determine what he really stands for.  As you say, most of the others confine themselves to the obscurity of academia.  Perhaps one reason is that they don't want the death threats that the MRM receive.  I continue to hear that MRM are "jokes" etc. but nobody is stepping up to say exactly what is wrong with their declaration.

I'm a super low maintenance (ahem lazy) person in general. My skincare is just about the only detailed and time consuming thing I do for myself and I don't see it as high maintenance at all. I love it and enjoy it so much that it's almost like a hobby for me. 
And what's the difference between the two sole types? 
Yeah I didn't know about it until I seen other youtubers saying they hate react videos. People are make 1-2k a month just to react at other videos. Pretty insane. 
Yes. Tried it on a few of my mates computers and theirs was fine. Might just need a reinstall. But funnily enough when i went to film it, i actually beat him...
or even worse, the nat 20 gets bumped up to a 23 so it is no longer a crit.
I'd be an ugly looking girl, then.
pretty average I think. 
Okay, maybe this didn't warrant a post. 
Ignoring heat, air, and assuming the entry and exit are exactly the same distance from the dead center of the earth you would be just fine.   You would drop in, you would accelerate as gravity pulled you down. Until you passed through the core. After which point you would begin decelerating as gravity tried to pull you back the way you came. Upon reaching the other side you could simply grab onto something and land safely as you would stop accelerating just as you reached the end.   If we re introduce air you would have an issue with terminal velocity. Gravity would only be able to pull you to a point at which the air wouldn't let you pass any faster. Because of this speed limit you would likely not reach the other end. Again assuming equidistance. If you introduce the heat well you melt really early in your trip anyway and it sort of doesn't matter.   Finally if the points are not equidistant from eachother the tube becomes one way. The taller end can reach the shorter end but not vice versa. 
You're right. It's also not a desolate place where the poor have no food/water/hope and no chance at improving their lives. Everybody gets a shot here.
We got Kuno with the open top and Knight with all her jiggly assets -_-
I've got 6, but only two or three are visible (depending on what shoes I'm wearing). I'm also 22. People need to stop judging based on tattoos or piercings. It's so old fashioned and closed minded. More and more people are getting them these days, soon those types of people aren't going to have anyone left to hire if they don't open their mind. 
Road rash yes! but wheres streets of rage?
How long does it take to clean the sea of hats off the ice when Scott scores his third?
Do you clock in and out every time you work?
Very common here in Australia to have a baby shower for your first baby. Bridal showers haven't caught on as much, none of my friends had one but I've heard of women having them. 
And feats are pretty goddamn abundant in pathfinder, and the bonus feats won't really get you over.   Higher level deeds other than dead shot are pretty garbage, especially when compared to Litanies and other paladin spells.  Smiting Shot is not just worse than smite, it's so bad as to be completely incomparable.   Smite lasts the whole encounter, and works on every shot you make until the target is ashy pulp, while smiting shot works with a special, standard attack action, which means no rapid shot, no haste, and no dead shot.   If that sounds terrible, it's because it is, and furthermore can only be used once a GODDAMN DAY until level 11.  
I have to go with Bartz.  It does the most damage before burst and he can use the widest verity of weapons.  He can also hit 4 elements weakness with his burst attacks.  I have Bartz, Terra, Seph, and Tyro's BSSB.  Terra is very disappointing, and it could just be the high res on all bosses that makes it very underwhelming. Tyro would win hands down but his is it's own class.  He basically never uses SG anymore (since i have Thyrus) and with some decent guns he can really dish out decent damage with his breaks and use Life Syphon.
If John Scott and Daniel Sedin each get hattricks in this game, I'll eat two whole cartons of whipped whip cream

Great job CBC, missed another goal

Oh woops I thought you meant Bronson should get his own show hahah 
Ross and Barry from Game Grumps kept referring to him as a "her" for almost the entire fight, on top of not really understanding who he was and why he was fighting them.  Also, thinking Alphys is a guy even though Mettaton refers to her as, well, "she", not two minutes into encountering her for the first time.
Haruna followed behind Takashi, breaking into a sprint. As she saw the second dove, she stepped out from behind Takashi and charged towards Kazuto. "If you want to run it's not too late, we won't follow you" she said in an almost mocking tone as she swung the blunt side of her tail towards him.  /u/KiraKhameleon

I don't really see what your "plan" is here. Just throw creatures on the board and try to grind your opponent down? I'd focus on trimming the fat and getting more playsets of fewer cards. The 'one of this and one of that approach' (probably limited by collection) is terrible for building a consistent deck. I feel you'd be better off cutting the modern stuff and playing this as a standard deck, modern is too fast what you have here.  [This](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/325179#paper) is a semi-decent Red/black agro Eldrazi deck for standard. If you are set on playing modern I'd work with this template and switch things in and out that fill similar roles.

It is. Don't kill him! He knows not what he does.
Is this a national bank or  state (by which I mean, who chartered the bank, not how big is it)?  If it is a national bank, you're first stop should be the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Consumer Action Group.  The OCC is the controlling regulator of national banks, so the CFPB would have to defer to them anyway.

You could even be objectively right, though i haven't seen any conclusive evidence.

I suck at this game. As in, I am unredeemably bad. I've played since Closed Beta, follow all the meta builds, and I've even joined a unit to try and pick up some tricks from people who don't suck as much - but I still struggle to get out of tier 4. An average match for me is 300-500 damage, 4 or 5 assists. Maybe a kill or two if I get lucky with timing. But I love this game, and sometimes I get lucky. Every now and then I have a match where everything seems to go my way. This is the story of one game when I scared myself just a little.  The other day I jumped in a TBR-C build I had thrown together to take advantage of the extra c-bills for the Performance Pack 'mechs - 3cLPL, Skirmish on Caustic. First an enemy light broke cover and was taking fire from 2 or 3 friendlies, I tagged him from just beyond optimal - and he popped. Must have nailed an XL side torso.   Next I crested a ridge and traded with some heavies - one Thunderbolt was already cored and retreating, so I threw a salvo his way - and down he went. Okay, I'm thinking - 2 salvos for 2 kills. Not every day you see that. Especially with my oceanic ping and terrible aim. But it won't last much longer.   But it did. Everywhere I looked, enemy 'mechs were dropping to a single salvo. My next victim was a Catapult that had been cored in the rear and had his back to me. WUBWUBWUB. Boom. Third kill. I start taking LRM fire so I retreat into the caldera - to find a Locust in a knife fight with a friendly Arctic Cheetah. As I turn to face them, the ACH blows off one of the Locust's legs. This is my lucky freakin' day. I take aim and shave off the other leg, and down he goes.  Now some motherfucker  has already ruined my chance at a 12-kill game by killing a couple of baddies, and three or four friendlies are down, so we're up by a couple of kills. There's a brawl breaking out on the other side of the volcano, so I cut across the caldera and flank the enemy main body along with the little ACH. First target is a straggling Dire Whale that's already lost its left torso - this bitch ruins my streak by forcing me to shoot him three times before dying. Still, that's my fifth, and all I've lost in return is my unarmoured left arm and a few points off the rest.  But killing that Whale had me on Override, and a brawly Atlas has decided to make me his little woman, so I high-tail it back behind cover - to chase me, the Atlas turned his back on two or three heavies, and his rear torso armour disappears in short order - but I know it's gonna take some time to cut through his structure, so, on the threshold of overheating, and with his SRMs beginning to find their mark, I begin to think this is the end - that is, until Papa Boar overheats and shuts down. Thank you, 'mech Jesus.   Already in reverse gear, I back up to the cover on the opposite side of the crater, and throw one last salvo at the immobile Boar just as he begins to wake up. Someone in my unit told me to always aim for the face on an Atlas - not for headshots, but to make sure all my damage lands on the CT and doesn't spread to the side torsos. So I shoot at his face - and he drops. What. I look at the target overlay, and his CT is still orange - but his head is gone.  That's right, I just HS'd a motherfucking Atlas. An overheated, immobile Atlas, but I'm counting it.   My CT is cored and orange, and my LT is cherry red from all the hot steaming loads of SRMs the Atlas busted on my face (I can't torso twist worth a damn), so I'm thinking that might be my last hurrah for this freakishly lucky game. But there are still a couple of baddies up on the slopes of the volcano, so I poke from cover and take aim at a Blackjack who's lost a ST (Blackjacks with STD engines? Welcome to Tier 4 scrubtown) and is brawling with what's left of my side's Alpha lance. I decide to go balls to the wall and push to around 250m. I'm actually putting effort into torso twisting this time, and my left torso finally pops, but as it does, so does the Blackjack. I didn't pay attention to who got the killing blow, so it could have been one of the three lights who were also fighting him - but I'm counting it. Seven kills, one baddie to go.  The last enemy 'mech is a Stalker 4N who drops an Arty strike on me and my buddies just as the Blackjack dies, then lights up yours truly with LL fire. My right arm pops, and with it two thirds of my firepower. One of the lights dies, and the other two aren't exactly fresh either. But hell if I'm not seeing this thing through to the end. The Stalker is about 500m away, and the two surviving lights have taken off towards him - but he's still looking at me. So I stare the big fucker down, holding down my single cLPL on his CT until he alphas me to death with 6LL. My MadCat cannot contain this much badass, and explodes in a manly fashion as the two lights finish off the enemy Stalker.  My heart is pounding, my brow sweaty, my vision is starting to turn red as the final scoreboard shows up. Victory, 12/10. My Stats? Six kills (must not have killed that Blackjack after all). Two assists. I can't remember the number of Component Destroyed, Brawling, KMDD and Solo Kill awards I got, but there were at least a couple. But the thing that surprised me most was the damage total. It was lower than I expected, given the amount of killing I did.  Somewhere around 350.
So the best case scenario for Kalitas is that it forces a bad block? If you land Olivia on turn 4, it means you're not under pressure and you can probably untap and win with Olivia.
CBC is so bad, show us the game (my NBC is blacked out)
Good idea!  Just did, hope someone bites 
Hah, wow. That was the first time I visited, in late October 2013. I had no idea what I was in for. I went to the Ukraine for a wedding (just before shit got crazy there), and I wanted to go somewhere else in Europe. Thought hey, I've never been to Switzerland, I hear it's nice, let's check it out. And it was, as you said, fucking stunning.

I don't know what a cardigan is, but I like your boobs.
not only that. the article also said she was injured. did she ask her friend to punch her or something so she could randomly accuse people of rape. 
If you smile in your sleep you may be a sociopathic killer.  And good points made. Just look at new streams and personalities that pop up. We run people out of the community before we even give them a chance. We're very incendiary and to add insult to injury we say things are the way they are blaming everything else other than ourselves.
*filthy subhuman
Well, I came into the officer's corps most the same as anyone, I suppose. I did well enough in my school on Coruscant that my grades qualified me for the Academy, and I elected to go through the Starfleet course. I'd always loved the big ships overhead, my dad had gave me some old blueprints (outdated, of course) of the Venator-class Star Destroyer when I was about ten, and I hung them on my wall. I must have spent hours looking at those things. Sometimes I think that I'd be able to oversee assembly of one on my own, given enough time and materials.  Anyway, I did well enough that I graduated with distinction and received a lieutenant's posting on one of the Imperial-II class Star Destroyers, running a maintenance team. Anyone who served on one of those early ships knew how often things went wrong, so I spent the majority of my first tour putting out fires both metaphorical and not before I was transferred out.  The majority of my shipboard career was spent under the command of Captain Rae Sloane after she assumed command of the "Ultimatum". She was something of a personal hero of mine, seeing as how she attained command at such a young age. It inspired me to do the same, even after she jumped to Admiral and was given the "Vigilance".   The Battle over Endor changed all of that. "Ultimatum" took heavy damage during the fighting, and once the Freedom Star II went up, most of the fleet, us included, jumped to hyperspace. When we hit normalspace again, a cracked coolant pipe hit me with compressed tibanna gas, and that was the end of my shipboard career.  The burns were substantial, but the Empire was gracious enough to get me outfitted with robotics for the lost arm and foot, and a round of bacta and cosmetic surgery has me looking mostly normal again. I'm not fit for combat duty on the big ships anymore, but I've found a new love groundside, managing Imperial recruitment efforts near Manaan, as well as assisting the Requisition side of things where I can.   It's rewarding work, helping potential young officers and pilots for the Imperial Navy discover the path they'd like to set themselves on. The Empire as we know it might be gone, but I think it lives on in them. I can occasionally see a bit of myself in some of them, and once in a very great while, I can see a young Rae Sloane or Wilhuff Tarkin passing through. The Empire's in good hands.

She's doing her usual intentionally-misleading BS, of course.  From the article (emphasis mine):  &gt; Clinton took aim at the Iowa legislature, which has been mulling lowering the age that children in the state can use handguns with parental supervision. “**What is one of their highest priorities? Lowering the age from 14 to let more children be able legally to have guns**,” said Clinton, prompting boos from the crowd at Howe Hall. “Now what kind of debate is that?”  Notice how she makes this law, which is about kids shooting under parental supervision, sound like a law about allowing toddlers to own guns.
Rubio shouldn't even be starting lol. 
im pretty sure that is whats happening.

How does one tell if a cpu is bottlenecking the system? Currently I run at 1366x768 until I get a better monitor and my Asus 290 runs at 100% with good frame rates with TR2013 (ultra benchmarks at 198max, minimum of 122), fallout 4 (ultra pins at 60 most of the time), etc, but with drops to 34 fps at certain times, but I'm worried if I scale up the resolution, my minimum fps will drop even lower. My cpu is still the i7-920, stock clocks, no HT to keep the temps down.  Edit: I've read that the cpu utilization is not always the best way to judge if a cpu bottleneck is occurring, so I thought I'd ask if there were any other method to test. if I increase the resolution, will cpu usage increase to the point where gpu usage will decrease?
Big Buff with a ripper!
&gt; Why build Mag around anything but power strength and efficiency?  The solution isn't "let's neuter the entire player base and detract from Warframe being what it is, a power fantasy", it's "fix Mag".
The thing is, you're using off-brand batteries that follow their format, but since you haven't bought *their* batteries, the off-brand batteries automatically don't work. You need to buy Fine Bros Batteries™ for the batteries to work. 
Really?  Why is that?  I have many fond memories of waking up early on weekends to grind out some Pokemon Blue on my Gameboy when it came out.

There is a chance that a parent may not go to see their GP and their child has meningitus due to this. Being Health secretary does not give him medical knowledge.   &gt;he's echoing a sentiment that I have found to be pretty much universal throughout the NHS - namely that a lot of professional time is wasted.  Perhaps the thrust of the point may be something that medical professionals want to address but the specific case he mentioned is the entirely wrong advice. That is the reason he should never say anything like this without checking with a professional is that he has no idea what is important or relevant when diagnosing an illness.
Neither does the Jewish messiah myth.
Fair enough :) The terminology does seem a bit euphemistic to me though.
Well, okay, but it literally did not exist in the [work](https://www.behance.net/gallery/Alain-Bousquet/5581159) created by the original artist, Alain Bousquet. And considering the many other stylistic oddities in the posted image, it seems to be an artifact generated by some sort of vectorizing or upscaling software.  EDIT to add: If you like the posted image more, nothing against that, btw :) It certainly has its own appeal.
Well, it might be simple, but: it's also wrong. Going from 8 seconds to 6 would be a 25% increase.... if all your damage would you be coming from the belt. And that is simply not true. Most of your damage as a LoN Bombardment Crus is dealt by your combo: Iron Skin + CoE + manual Bombardment cast.  Therefor, and for other reasons (fe. higher thorns roll): an ancient belt is better for sure.

You forgot about livestock and dairy cows, which are raised on alfalfa, which is pollinated by bees.
Being more open and free doesn't make it better maybe to you it does. That being said Witcher 3 is more technical immersive than Fallout 4 in terms of graphics,cutscenes,etc. However its stupid to compare these two games are different genres. Fallout 4 should be compared to the other Fallouts.
for the terms of this question, I think it might be understandable to count Oilers history as well.  do Titans fans strongly consider Oilers history when talking about their franchise? I know officially the team does, and has pictures of Warren Moon up I think, but it doesn't seem like the fans seem to focus on it much, which would make sense.

I didn't spot one overweight person. Amazing.
the advice I usually give my clients is to just say you have family matters that require some time each day, but shouldn't take much longer than lunch and that you'll stay later or come in earlier if needed.  if they ask what, you just say it's personal and you'd rather not discuss it.  at larger companies this is often all you need to say.
Are these pictures from bad angles, or is that stadium really that disappointing, visually?
I'm so torn on the issue. I might just go with whatever I have available.
My paternal grandmother. She was an abusive alcoholic, but my dad puts her on a pedestal. Her oldest child burned all of her pictures out of spite, so I don't even really know if I resemble her.   She died in a car accident, drunk and with some random guy. My grandfather caught them cheating together and while they were speeding to get away, they crashed into a telephone pole. 40 years later, the former site of the crash was where my bus picked me up dropped me off from school. Small world.  I'm indifferent towards the name since my mother gave me a different spelling. Apparently I was going to be one of the top 10 names in the late 1980s if my father hadn't insisted... so I guess I'm glad for that. I didn't like any of my mother's choices.
Yep. But then, you can go even better. The Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad used the "L" to reach the Loop. It had two trainsets which were also articulated (but not open as the 5000s were) that had four units per set. (Obviously longer than a married pair.) You can make a car as long as you want this way, but the trade-off is the number of trucks you have to add which adds to the cost. But you do gain more passenger space and require fewer cabs and associated control equipment.

You keep adding "never" or "don't ever" to my quote. You are alternately not quoting me accurately, or quoting me accurately but then criticizing it based on words you add, yourself. Literally every other post you've flip-flopped on this point. Why do you think that's ok?   As to the second thing, I was trying to explain that somebody else has spread my specific thread to another subreddit. If that wasn't you, fair enough. But you're using a specific accusation that might bring undue attention upon me, especially within the context of gaming. Pardon me if I worry about that.
Thank you :)
Yep! 
Well, I don't need to think, Justicar saved me half the times in this matchup. I can't cut it.
Personally, I just dont want to analyse a new quote again hehe. but anywho I think im just going to stick with the quote.  Perhaps changing the wording to "In romeo and Juliet, romeo exhibit his despair for love by forming a relationship with Juliet, despite knowing the dire consenquences"

Yeah that's one of the inconvenient truths about the AFL achieving parity after Super Bowl 3 they didn't . They were still the inferior conference and the only true AFL power to win a SB post merger was the Raiders in 76.
Actually one of the things the EVGA support rep had me try did the trick. But sadly I have no idea which, Fallout 4 just stopped crashing on me &lt;_&lt;  I applaud them for even being willing to help.. every other game worked fine except for that bug ridden pile of...awesome.
There can be a big difference between aquarium and drinking RO systems. Let's say your tap comes out with a TDS of 300. Drinking water systems might get it down to 80. Aquarium systems should get it down to 0. It is so pure it won't even conduct electricity.

No, it's quite the opposite. What you just said is just the most overused excuse people spread on the internet because they are lazy fucks. 
You're right except for the part where they hate their society because they are fed propaganda and brainwashed to love it

I'm just working on a packaging solution using that (I was the one who posted the link to that). I've worked with /u/helno to get a slightly deeper version of his case that I hope to pair with a 6000 mAh flat cell battery (7.2mm x 56mm x 110mm) and a power switch. I haven't figured out how I am going to monitor battery status and powering the Pi from the charger, but those are relatively minor fixes/mods. I was planning on giving a Pirep once I got it assembled (and then flight tested). Don't worry, updates are forthcoming!
You're arguing with a guy who has "fascist" as a flair. Just a heads-up your efforts may not bear fruit.
What was put in the middle? Looks like a playing card.
Start with season 1. Enterprise does a good job of character building and you won't get the payoffs if you start obi season 3. Also, you'll run out of enterprise fast. Give yourself something to look forward to. Season 4 of enterprise is my favorite season of trek. Work your way up to it.
I had stamped my 2009 vokey spin milled before and I found those softer than the SM5 (might be the finish). You'll need a couple good strikes to get the stamping right. 
This is a new and exciting post.

Let me just say first, that yes this does suck for him, being asked to do this so close to NSD.  However, he still has a scholarship.  We are asking him to take another semester to get bigger and faster.  The ugly side of it is that it likely means there is another commit that we did not expect and we didn't the room for, thus asking Cole to grayshirt.  Bradley Bozeman and John Parker Wilson both grayshirted, Bozeman is in line to start next year and JPW helped get this thing started.  Yes it sucks and we might catch some flack, but the kid still had a full scholarship.
Perfect.
No hindsight is 20/20. Like I said if I knew at the time what would really happen I wouldn't have done any of it.

I used to do this, until my wife and I finally combined our finances. Having to get the go ahead before I buy a game has pretty much stopped my from buying any games I'm not sure I'm going to play.
i dunno a creepy puppet full of terrible puns always worked for me personally should definitely go unchanged...i really liked that movie devil, that would have been a perfect cryptkeeper story...but he's had a few flops as well which sucks

This is 100% serious, totally unacceptable and, for the record, something that my wife and I (15 years) have never even begun to approach verbally. Every single time one of us goofs up, the other one is there to cheer them up and assure them we all make mistakes.  You know why? Because we like each other. *We're rooting for each other*.  Ditch this guy, *now*.
Good lord Buff...
I agree with you that in general its better to over acknowledge rather than under acknowledge, and that its an art (which I don't have yet :/). I hope as I get more experienced with these presentations I'll be able to find a style that works for me.
Interesting, What's in Zhongshan? Cause I always see it as just a bunch of little towns stringed together (basically a southern version of Linyi) rather than an actual city to build a career.

You're intitled to your beliefs and ideas but muslims reject that definition of jinn and other supernatural creature. Jinn are not all identical so maybe a variation in them explains your experience. Either way muslims don't accept anything other than what's in scripture and we leave it at that.   If you think there is anything better than islam then you are an outsider
Create modules instead of one monolithic system? Make it testable? Easy to update? Log errors? Make it scalable? That's pretty obvious advice.

  Chap stick and Dumpster are trademarks of products with different names for which they were by far the largest in the market, but they didn't take the name of the product themselves. Chap stick is a brand of LIP BALM. We don't all uniformly refer to lip balm as Chap stick, because that's what it is, we do it because we're used to that brand of it. We call salted crackers "Saltines", even if they're not that brand of the product, because it's a household name for a product.    You're presenting validity of trademarks with products that have completely different structures, intents, and of different scale. Names born of wide misuse has nothing to do with a trademark and trademarking a popular brand of a product doesn't retroactively ban all other from making similar products.  The Fine Bros are doing what Saltine would be doing if the cracker product was literally called a saltine, before the company even existed. It's like Pizza Hut trying to copyright Pizza, with the argument that they have many chains and all have "Pizza" in the name.  "Sure dude, you can make pizza as long as you don't have pizza in the name of your establishment or call anything pizza."

Unfortunately there is sometimes very real rape that happens in the industry (the recent accusations against James Deen come to mind), but a partnership like this is a huge step in helping fix issues like that.  Edit: it's just an example guys. I realize they are accusations, not proof.

As a (very) casual fan of sports car racing over the years - the whole thing of having 2-3 different classes of cars on the track at one time is a pretty weird concept. You're going to have 3 different winners? Anything below the Daytona Prototypes (if that's what they still call them) seem like red-headed speedbumps in the field.  It's definitely a different type of racing than what we're used to - it's an endurance race, obviously. Pretty shocking to have it come down to that, I'll admit. 
CBC's camera work tonight is about as awful as I've ever seen. 
Anything with Peg Goldschlager's name on it should be questioned.
Hermit Druid isn't necessarily useful in every context. If you run a single basic, he immediately becomes useless jank.   If you were drafting and you opened a Hermit Druid, would you pick it? Hell no, because even with graveyard-based strategies he's not that strong. Outside of one very specific type of combo, Hermit Druid has very little utility.

In other threads, many native Swiss are completely against it. 
How does it not have original content if the game world and its content was made exclusively for the game? How is it a reskin of a game made by a different publisher and developer in a different setting and environment?  By that logic, no MMO since the original Everquest has had original content and they're all reskins of Everquest.
Well, after reading the other stories about the parties lasting until the  early morning hours, when others were trying to rest for work the next day I wondered how they could party until 4 in the morning and then get up for work.  They can't all work night shift.

A lot of California's GDP is from the tech industry and agriculture. I don't really hear anything about Canada exporting a lot of food or about any serious technology coming out of Canada, so I thought that that would keep Canada's GDP a lot lower.

I dont particularly care about any of this. I dont think react videos are funny. I think youtube celebrities are vapid, empty souls, arguably worse than reality stars. I don't care if theyre trying to make money off a product, and I also don't care that it seems, to me, the product seems pretty lame.  But I have to say this: I do think its fascinatingly humorous that these two men are literally trying file for ownership of **the completely passive observation of something**.  Thats fucking balls.

Where are you getting this information? Are you aware that Islam is the biggest religion in the world?  There are more than a billion Muslims, are you trying to tell me that you know how the "average Muslim" thinks and behaves?  'Cause I don't believe that you do.  
To be fair, not being a rule-abiding Jedi knight and turning to the Dark side are two different things.  I might encourage someone to skip school to go have fun, but still be upset when they drop out and then become a crack addict.

Now these clowns pop up...hm. Seems she has work to do."  *She bows a little.*  Gage: "Thank you for this. Honestly all I do is help Loki gather information from time to time, but I'm much keener on staying home with my wife. Doesn't hurt to venture out every once in a while, though."
You're right, it is as irrelevant as your statement.
Catalan is not a spanish dialect, it's a language on it's own, lots of catalans would get pretty mad that you said that haha so just to clarify. Eivissa is just the catalan word for Ibiza and the one that they use there because it's their native language.
Haha, the Han Solo looks like Fred Armisan from snl.
That's definitely an area he needs to work on. 
Bernie Sanders sounds like he has his head screwed on straight. Some of Trump's policies seem really good, and I do understand where he is coming from with regards to immigration. However he really seems like an unprofessional twat and I don't support anyone who thinks that corporations should be taxed less.  Either way, based on what is written on the site thus far, Bernie would get my vote. I think that the Police Force in America needs fixing asap. It's really bringing down America's image overseas.

[Academic] Transitioning Student Veterans: An Empirical Analysis of College Adjustment of an Underserved Population on Campus (U.S., 18+, undergraduates at 4-yr institutions) https://bsu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_8fh6gks31Qqh9f7  Greetings:  My name is April Krowel and I am an Army veteran and doctoral candidate in the Counseling Psychology Program at Ball State University. I am in the process of collecting data for my dissertation, which examines college adjustment of students and student veterans on campus, and am writing to ask you to assist in my study. The study consists of a 68-item questionnaire as well as demographic questions, which will be completed online, with no perceived risks associated with participation. Participation is open to all undergraduate students at least 18 years old, and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete. I will be donating $2.00 for each completed survey to the Pat Tillman Foundation, a nonprofit organization that invests in military veterans and their spouses through educational scholarships. If you are a Ball State CPSY student, you may receive 1 hour of research credit for a CPSY course by completing this study. There are no other incentives offered. If you have any additional questions regarding the study please feel free to ask at any point in time.   Thank you in advance for your help.  April Krowel, M.A. Doctoral Candidate Dept. of Counseling Psychology and Guidance Services Ball State University Muncie, IN 47306   Note: This study has been approved by Ball State University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB #722929-1).
This cookie flavor is pretty true to the real thing. It's quite awesome!
Agents of SHIELD, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Age of Ultron.  It begins with the arc-relevant AoS S1A storylines, focusing mainly on Daisy's training, intercut with the Lemurian Star mission. This leads into the Fall of SHIELD storyline, cutting between AoS and TWS as appropriate. Then some of SHIELD season two, leading up to the Avengers tie-in and the Age of Ultron film being the climax.
The only proven incident was with Keith when Badawi was still new. 
An Anaconda.  Just load it up with tons of shit and take my time exploring the galaxy. The reason I picked it is due to the vast amounts of cargo area that could be converted into other stuff so I could bring other wanabe explorers with me. Might not have the biggest jump range of the other ships but tons of room for choice.  And I just love the way it looks. Why would I pick any other ship when this big guy can get me a limitless paycheck? ;)
As the other guy said very few pokemon available appealed to me, only one starter looked sort of alright but even then its stats were subpar. I didn't like the linear lay out of the region, the fact you were not allowed old pokemon until after the story had been completed, completely turned off by the story and villains. Ive heard loads say it's the best but it didn't keep me interested at all, I don't even know what was going on. Some guy called N raised to be a king by some cult. Also the legendaries were quite unappealing, a pure black one a pure white one and some ugly looking icy one. The whole dream world element made no sense to me, I never figured out you were suppose to do stuff online with the pokemon. The sequels were slightly better.   But the main thing I hated was that this was where I learned about IV's, but there was nothing I could do about it. Hours of breeding to guarantee one perfect IV, I wanted to battle competitively, this was impossible unless I could hack in pokemon some how. And this was when wifi battles were starting to become quite popular.

CJ:  - 2nd-highest career yards per game average (behind a young guy who could slip quite a bit). - Fastest WR to break 10k yards (10k yards being the longevity benchmark historically). - Best receiving 3-year span in NFL history - Best single season in NFL history - Best 4-quarter game in NFL history  Davis:  - 3rd highest career yards per game average, behind his era's contemporary Barry Sanders and the guy every RB is behind, Jim Brown - An elite 3-year stretch, but with a relatively low-for-elite YPC. It's no secret that Davis was abused in terms of carries.  - Didn't get to 10k yards - 5th best single season by yards - Post-season (team stat) success  Whether or not you believe Davis belongs in the HOF, they are two different cases.
That's great!  We're going to be doing some training with an Ice Racing crew in February, so if you're interested in joining at least get us your email so we can include you on that!

The problem is if I want to go rogue for credits, the best thing I can do it sit outside the SW checkpoint (I think, might be the mid-west checkpoint), gun people down as they appear outside the checkpoint (even lay down a sticky/turret/whatever makes the kill as effortless as possible) and then go sprinting down the sewer/subway entrance that's about 20 feet away and yakkety sax around for about 70 seconds until I get my 200 credit bonus for surviving a bounty. Once you streamline that process you're looking at 10,000+ credits per hour for just being a camping douchebag.  Meanwhile reaching "manhunt" status is a death sentence with an infinitely resetting timer and the reward for spending so much time wanted is NOT proportionate to surviving a level 1 bounty. 
Looks like a bottle intended for food industry bulk usage. Basically what a restaurant would order for use in dishes. I often buy a lot of Asian food this way because the price per unit can go *really* low.
Yes, that is why I always try to give data, so at least I know that I myself am not lying to me, and also thrid parties. I get the thought that the arguments are being evaluated.

I'm aware of the limitations of LACP. For what it's worth, the server *will* be serving multiple streams simultaneously. LACP isn't a requirement, just something I wouldn't mind having if I can get it for a few dollars extra (the price difference right now on Amazon is only $7).   I don't have experience with this equipment though. I'm wondering how well regarded these hardware choices come. Are TP-Link switches any good? What about the rest? Recommend another wireless AP other than Ubiquiti UniFI?  NAT routers in particular have been hard to find at a reasonable price point, which makes me a little wary of the EdgeRouter X -- it seems *too* cheap. Although, my 'net connection is 150 Mbps symmetric, so I don't need something that can guarantee a full gigabit throughput between the ONT and the switch, but I wouldn't mind having the extra capacity for down the line. 
It only really suffers in laggy play, where you can't reliably make use of its silly range to beat other shotguns.  Outside of lag, it kills with a headshot further away than any other shotgun, so it can potentially beat the Con-D and Party Crasher if you know what you're doing and have pretty good aim.  I actually think the update was a net buff really. It means that it more reliably kills with the headshot than it did before and the smoother shotgun cut off means it kills from marginally further away than it did too. But it's still just one of those guns where you have to use it on the right map and you have to get your movement down really solid, or it's going to suck.
Uneducated, uncultured and proud of it.  Thinks all music begins with ACDC and ends with Cold Chisel.  Thinks the ideal overseas holiday is a week in Bali swilling beer by the pool and throwing up in Kuta nightclubs.  Has a mullet and a southern cross tattoo.  Every fourth word is "fuck" and every sixth is "cunt".  Wears ugg boots and track pants with a flannel shirt to go out... shopping, movies, on a date; doesn't matter.  Usually works in a mind numbingly boring job but because his mate Johnno works FIFO, he's going to get his truck licence and " leave this shithole and go work in the mines".

You should torture them until morale improves.
I found staying under him to be more effective than anything else. The only attack that gets you when you are under him is that wild bucking move, and he doesn't use that one too often. None of his other attacks will hit you there.  Stage 2 doesn't deal as much damage but he combos you to death. You get hit once and you're staggered and bound to get hit 2 more times. Idk, I find stage 2 much harder, I guess I'm the weirdo here.

It might be worth looking into, find out which ponds firefighters don't use and possible signs of unexpected algae blooms in the past decade. It's a definite possibility that she could have also been dumped in a body of water I know Indiana has quite a few that go untested or not well maintained. The DNR initiative of the 80's has not been enforced as well as some other states. 
Ultimate Spider-Man benefited from being written by Bendis only who was a great fit for the title all the way through.  But that does irk me how inconsistent everything else was. They obviously had no clear direction for any of the titles.  Xavier declares 'X-Men, we're going to change the world.", which could have been the start of a version of the X-Men that didn't have to deal with the mansion getting blown up every other year. How great would it have been to see a more successful, cohesive version of the team?  Ultimate Origins was planting the seeds for something big but then they just said fuck all with that.  And poor, poor Ultimates. You didn't deserve Loeb.
BHOP was and still is the shit!! Goddamn, that GIF was so fun to watch. Thank you very, very much for this.
The two teams were stealing each other's food, so one team pee'd on their own food then watched the other team steal/eat it. Then that team jizzed on their own food for revenge.
Yeah, they should probably practice or something.
Stewie from Family guy: Cool 'h'Whip'h'
In quite the conundrum right now actually. I need to decide whether or not to continue along the career path I am currently on. Im in my first year of professional school (third year in college) and my heart really isn't in to it. On one side I will be making six figures once I graduate. On the other, I am certain that I will end up hating every minute of it. At this point, I already have a ridiculous amount of loans to pay off and will end up disappointing a lot of people if I drop out of the program I'm in. I honestly feel like I am stuck and that the longer I go on, the deeper the hole I am digging for myself becomes.  
Rune here. I pitched the idea for this game at the jam because I wanted to see if we could create the sense of exploring a large space despite the very limited physical space.  One of my favorite aspects of games is to explore, experience large and varied locations and feeling like I'm on a journey. With room scale VR, this can be tricky.  Teleporting is one approach to solve it, but while I haven't tried it myself, I suspect it breaks the immersion of feeling like you're physically moving around in the space.  The moving platforms is a different approach. The downside is that it places very specific restrictions on the gameplay and the space as well. But what it then manages is to really make it feel like you're moving through a large space with your own body. I've tried demos where you're transported on one large room-scale platform, but the sensation with many smaller platforms that you're stepping between is entirely different, I think.  This was my first go at trying to develop for the Vive, and the experience has made me pretty excited for it. (It was also surprisingly easy.)  Have a go with the game and let us know what you think!
Only if they don't get the vote.
Why do you say that? Are you implying that you agree with the idiot I replied to? 
I think that's totally a compliment!
I agree with you that it's a shame Megatron was on such a shitty team for his career, but can't support your follow up.  Manning has had many chances, and an exceptional career. He is one of the most decorated, and accomplished quarter backs ever. Super bowl champ (playing in 4th next week), super bowl MVP, NFL all-time leader in career touchdown passes and passing yards.

I was in the same boat a while back, even made an elaborate post about it.   http://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFight/comments/3a9gnh/breaking_news_dimension_debris_shortage_crisis/  Boy have the tables turned now. I mean, just take a look at this.  http://imgur.com/5Rg714b  My current bottle neck is GUK's. I get around a few hundred a day but they're gone damn near as soon as they are acquired.

It just means the non rapid fire non launcher weapons need some buffs.  Right now the special launcher weapons and high ROF weapons are the only ones used at the high end. Low fire rate rifles are basically useless and snipers are only slightly better.
Whether it's good or bad I at least get the Falstad change as a concept. Overdrive/call of the wildhammer and wombo.  Sindy definitely isn't a damage ult, as op says it's for cc. Though it didn't get a cd tradeoff more damage on Stage Dive isn't really appealing either.  Hammer buff is fine, napalms still probably going to be goto.  Falling sword certainly better, though again probably not competing with shield. Although I'm a bit curious how it goes at 20 with the upgrade. I'm not quite sure how it works, on one target in try it's 1k damage..are there more bolts with more heroes or a fixed amount? Still, giving up indestructable. But maybe for those oddball no damage qm comps?

Wouldn't change much.  People vote top of the ticket and running mates only really matter around the edges, which is precisely what Trump has little of.  &gt; Would a Democrat even accept (say it meant the 1st in modern history to reach across the aisle)?  Jim Webb sorta withdrew from the race specifically citing his "exploring a 3rd party bid."  Webb is a centrist Democrat with legislative and military experience, exactly what Trump lacks.  Not only is it possible, I wouldn't even be *surprised* if he was chosen.

That's a might long post to say you're just going to ignore everything I say. I know Dan is a racist because of the things he has said here. You had implemented the CSS ban on my account on this subreddit so that I couldn't post here. You always bring up the mod log about stuff that isn't in the mod log for some strange reason. You flaired me as an SJW for some reason so that I would be brigaded and wouldn't be able to post here. All because apparently I'm not a full-on racists, and apparently you have a hard-on for me because I'm smart enough to tell what is going on.  you are doing that too much. try again in 9 minutes.  Don't worry I have the time to spare ;)  &gt; People who don't read your posts and downvote you because of your flair are idiots and that's not my intention.  I thought this was a serious reddit, but it's run by a troll. I have literally stated a fact, and one of your racist friends says about me "this guy doesn't know what he's talking about" but then for some reason repeats the fact, and I get downvoted and they get upvoted. I'll write a paragraph that gets voted down to -20 explaining a situtation and people will reply "U R 2 retarded" and will get upvoted, but you're right, I can totally see how it's possible you're not a troll and never intended for that to happen.  You were trolling worlnews with rt.com articles and got them removed and I pointed out that rt was a propoganda arm of the Russian government. Majorly downvoted. Just today someone posted here asking what's up with rt.com... and the highest rated comment is someone explaining they are a propoganda arm of the Russian government.  I'm beginning to see why you're so hostile towards me.

Kind of ridiculous but do you think this strategy would be possible with a team of level 1s provided my Advantilator was strong enough?  My Cloud is Lv65 with very good IX synergy (+SSB) but the rest of the team would be level 1 except for Tyro at Lv57.  I figured since Holy and Shock would kill after Climhazzard no matter what, does it really matter what level the other members are?

I studied Hapmudo under Master Kim and Taekwando when I was very young.  Sparing and practicing your form are very different things. And are both a part of martial arts.

My dad told me a story when he was in Kunsan during the early '90s, that he woke up after a night of drinking in some guy's rice paddy, buckass nude.   The guy found my dad and it turns out he loved GIs and brought my dad into his home, showed my dad pictures of him in Vietnam with his buddies around decapitated VC, holding VC heads, ear necklaces, etc.  Fucking ruthless.
For a temporary problem, yeah I think so.  What's the point of doing something that you cannot un-do for a problem that will go away?  Find another solution that isn't set in stone.  You wouldn't just buy a new car every time yours has a problem.

Does he keep fit as well? I know a lot of guys whose libido drops off due to natural reasons or unnatural in the sense of getting fatter and less fit. They started hitting the gym again and getting fitter builds back up that desire for the opposite sex. Incorporate him to stay fit with you and if that fails then I would probably walk away.
Nothing to do with being anti-semitic, not all Jews are this way, but all those in the ruling class are Jews. I'd prefer if you think first before making broad generalisations and brandishing me with badly thought out left wing classifications. The families in the ruling class:   Rothschild (Bauer or Bower)  Bruce       Cavendish (Kennedy)       De Medici       Hanover       Hapsburg       Krupp       Plantagenet       Rockefeller       Romanov       Sinclair (St. Clair)       Warburg (del Banco)       Windsor (Saxe-Coburg-Gothe)  They own the global banking system, of which the central banks in each country enact policies that are designed to extract wealth from the citizens, through artificially created boom/bust cycles, inflation, and the payment of interest. They are all Jewish (yes, even house of Windsor).  A question for you: in a civilised society where technology is always improving and peoples lives are supposedly being made more efficient, why is it people are working longer hours, and why is it that women are often having to work also just to support the household, when originally they could survive on just the man's wages? And before you go all left wing on me again, I'm all for equality, my question purely focusses on the comparison of quality of life obtainable by the same amount of work, between now and then. Surely if we are more efficient we should be working less? Where does this excess efficiency go, if not into the coffers of our rulers through taxes and interest? Further, which way is this trend heading? More or less debt/taxes in the world now than ever? Negative interest rates in the horizon to tax those who hold savings too? See the evidence is everywhere, wealth extraction is very real.
That would make a good art pop album cover.

 There are three possible incarnations, Red blue, green. Whatever incarnation isnt there is what the boss is. The other you should want to kill the incarnations is Green&gt;red &gt; blue. You have to kill both incarnations within the lyrith's 5 turns.Kill the incarnations quickly by armor breaking one then use your nuker, then do the same for the next one real quick. Then once both are killed go Ham on the boss, If she brings back the incarnations again then rinse and repeat, but if the lyrith is at 30% hp then you can ignore the incarnation and go straight for the boss. Try it Ill be here for a while so keep me informed of any problems you run into.

That's technobabble for fibreglass reinforced plastics. Which isn't bad or something like that, just makes the plates a tiny bit leighter than their metal counterparts.   For 9 pounds I just would the metal knockoffs. The only thing which could be a negative is that their manufacturing tolerance could be worse than the original Manfrotto one. It's worth a try though.

Just for the future, the "Source" in "Open Source" is mainly referring to the source code. You're talking about assets though. Which I guess could be a part of that deal. It's what Valve does, anyway.  I've got plenty of friends in the game design biz and from what I understand, nothing makes developers sweat more than letting their users have direct access to source material. But even beyond that, even if the devs wanted us to have access to code and models and stuff, the beancounters would stonewall that effort and it would stay stonewalled.   Once something is open to the public, it pretty much stops being property of its original creator in all ways but name. Valve does it with their content because of their business philosophy. They built their company by scooping up amateurs that they've discovered as a byproduct of releasing their development tools into the wild.   Blizzard doesn't do that, so they've got no reason to release anything.

Uh what? Being a console doesn't make it "hack free" just look anywhere and you'll find exploits, hacks, etc for just about every console ever made. If anything it's worse because the process of getting a patch in to fix those things on consoles takes significantly more time than through PC. It may be harder to implement such exploits on consoles than PCs, but when it does eventually make its way to console its definitely a lot worse.

Set in the near future where oil is running out anyway.  Meaning either their oil is all gone or nearly gone to the point where they can barely supply their own needs without adding all of the EU into the pot, which means price of oil goes up significantly and Russia being a "poor" country prices their citizens out of it - no fuel to keep warm.  Would be my reasoning.

World Mission Society Church of God. Cult out of Korea that started in the 80's. Ran into one one day and thought they were Witnesses.

As far as I know the only three drug trials have gone badly wrong in the last two decades - a University of Pennsylvania in the US (1999), the Northwick Park trial in the UK (2006) and the recent Rennes drug trial in France - that's against a background of over 300,000 registered trials performed in that period. I'm fairly sure that makes drug trials pretty safe.  They are however both invasive and time consuming - having people inquiring into minutia of your life, your diet, your behavior, etc. and having to turn up to hospitals for regular appointments for checkups, injections, interviews etc.  I wouldn't do it - not due to safety concerns. It would just mess my life up too much.

ZGS does have a niche use in PvP though. It lets you get a more consistent freeze on hides/armadyl, which is really underrated. It's pretty clutch in clanning or castlewars. That's not as strong as an AGS or SGS in terms of how popular the activity it's useful in is, but it does have a niche.

Guys there are two game threads, I'm confused. Other one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/43lp6b/game_thread_team_michael_irvin_at_team_jerry_rice/)
I just need to ask what would be the point? can't we already discuss everything we need to right here? and if it something that has literally nothing to do with the yogs wouldn't we then just go to the subreddit about that specific thing and discuss it there with people who probably know and understand more than the people here?

It's good to jump into social situations and sort of out yourself out there:)  The only person I'm dependent on seeing is my boyfriend, but that's understandable because you usually spend time with the person you're dating haha. In high school when I had friends always wanting to hang out with me, I always made excuses not to do anything with them. Not because I was anxious, but it just didn't feel necessary to me. They were good friends and I loved them, but I'm more satisfied when I'm hanging out by myself anyways.   You realy don't have anything to lose! Some people you may never see again anyways, so why worry. I use that approach a lot because I know if I didn't, I woudln't even be able to open my mouth to speak. That sounds like anxiety to me (You may not have it as severely as some. I know I'm not very severe, but it has gotten in the way for me to funtion on a day to day basis some days). I've stopped myself from saying stuff because I've felt like nobody would care. My boyfriend and old friends have to speak for me sometimes time. And I too have had times where someone approached me and I would just look at them wide eyed and completely forgotten how to move my mouth.

No Cheating sounds like a good suggestion to prevent crazy stupid walls being everyone's submission, but how would you suggest imgur guidelines to weed out "look mah, I built this in stages.." *stages of cheating huehue*  Funny icons :D, this seems fun - thanks for the community activities Moderator Decaxon :).

CBC with some more stunning camera work
In every case I've seen with T-Mobile, if you can pick up a Canadian network signal, you can connect to it. Although I've never been in an area with Videotron (302-500) coverage, so I haven't tried them.
I guess I should have stated it a bit clearer, I rather was talking about a class that actively uses stress to boost attacks, slowly going insane. It's not quite similar to Hellion or Abomination, IMO.
Do not worry, the votes are first hand-counted in full view of everyone, and then volunteers will record the hand-written tally.

Actually I already released my game. I'm waiting a bit to iron it out and add some more levels before I post it here. Also I don't have enough points to post self promotion links in this sub yet :D But since you asked about it you can give it a go. Any feedback would be appreciated.

His not so awesome life? He still has a loving family, tons of money, and a degree in mechanical engineering, not to mention lots of fans who support him.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure many people here, including myself, never thought about it enough to realize it's not "the guy that dies pays with his shit"... it's rather "i'm paying you with my sword"
This is a really fun format. All the John Scott bullshit aside the NHL really nailed the format this year.
*For a traditional experience try:*  [**Ice Striped Cellar**: 18A4-0000-01B5-F553](https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/18A4-0000-01B5-F553)  A traditional SMB3 Ice Castle with a traditional boss fight. A few jumps and tricks might have you caught up for a minute, but completing this will sure pay off in the end! SMB3, medium-hard, icy, traditional, boss fight   Ok. Honestly, how difficult is this level? I am thinking about making it easier.  Keep having fun!  -Mewtwo  EDIT: REUPLOADED.

Can we finally get a new Shazam title?
Yeah but we won't have access to all of the currently locked skills, so do we know which ones we will have access to? I know for example the FM 1 HM skill isn't until 50, but I don't know any others.
so are you saying you believe in karma?
1. I have them tuned all down to the lowest you complete moron. It IS due to crappy coding.  2. Windows 10. I don't understand why anyone would use anything less than Win 10.  3. I'm gonna make a broad generalization and say that 99.99% of people are going to say and be able to back it up that Graphical Settings in SW:ToR don't matter. The game runs like shit in Warzones and Ops at Ultra Low, and Ultra High.

Yes, it's since been almost a decade since I watched it and the only thing I remember is how I intrigued by this series was.  Especially the art and the visuals made this work stand out so much. I think it's one of the most interesting series to host a rewatch for.
Bwahahaha
When will CBC ask a ref to do the play-by-play?
I'm guessing that tends to narrow down to "dank memes".
They foreshadowed Nikumi's shokugeki with the Elite 10.
Try going into conversations level headed and not looking to take shots. If you're angry at her/frustrated and you *know* you have things you could use go hurt her, **don't speak to her**. Take some time to think, tell her "Hey, I'm gonna take afew, I want to talk with you in a good head, I don't want to hurt you".   Being in a relationship means that you have the power to choose to do it well and you also have the power to destroy it. Being so close to someone means they've let you in, shown you their insides and outs and trusted you to **keep those things safe and not use it against them**. Work on your self control, and maybe your self image as well. Perhaps the reason you feel the need to put her down is because you feel threatened/intimidated by her. I obviously don't know the make up of your relationship, just be mindful of it and decide to... Be better. :-)

No one is upset that the board wants to take steps towards integrating youth. They are upset because you don't have to do it by pushing a club legend out the door who is the perfect mentor to help integrate them into the 1st team. They are upset because the club couldn't even offer him a $1 contract to be a squad player/coach and instead just give him the cold shoulder and let his agent tell him on the phone. Roman can be your "true legend" or whatever the fuck your saying, but Roman has no class when it's time to say goodbye. JT deserved a face to face with Roman as did Jose.

I'll check all of those out. And damn I love that self titled album. I'll also return the favour and recommend you to check out CHON if you're also into prog rock. It's basically the perfect fusion of prog and jazz, in the form of (mostly) instrumental guitar music.
Nope. In Wild World, you can't connect to the Internet anymore anyways - the servers were taken down.   You also can't connect to your friends through emulation.

O fato de proteger os direitos de uns não significa abrir mão dos direitos de outros, né?  Dizendo de outro jeito: não é porque o preso em flagrante (estuprador, assassino, o que seja) tenha direito de ser tratado como ser humano que o policial vai ser desvalorizado.   Nào vi nada aí que desmereça o policial. Que sim, precisa ser valorizado porque faz algo extremamente útil, vital é super difícil de ser feito.

My advice, as a Chef that works in an extremely hot environment all year round, is water. Drink a lot of water, this weather makes it very easy to become dehydrated very quickly without noticing. Drink before you are thirst and at regular intervals throughout the day.  That and a zen like attitude to the weather helps. The heat just is, moaning about it doesn't make it better. The more you think about it, the more you feel it, the bigger the impact it has on you.

No, I am dead serious. That woman is toxic. She has destroyed the party with her third rail triangulation crap. The party is split and losing voters every day to Trump. Call me a troll if you like.

UB streetwear meetup when?
I'm thinking a person did or said something to get the dogs attention and this was just a normal response from the dog. Puppies just happened to be in wrong place at wrong time. Hence why the dog jumped up and faced a certain direction regardless of puppies in vicinity. 
The e-nano warranty is pretty good. I've had to send it back twice and got a new one each time. I was just very unlucky. The first one had some issue with the power going in and out and second time one of the power pins broke which at one time was a known issue. My current one has been going strong for almost a year now, no signs of ware. 
Adele is quite popular as well as Maroon 5   If I'm not wrong, this is Gaon's Chart for foreign songs (Gaon is like Billboard in korea, I think...) http://gaonchart.co.kr/main/section/chart/online.gaon?serviceGbn=ALL&amp;termGbn=week&amp;hitYear=2016&amp;targetTime=04&amp;nationGbn=E

Again with this CBC? Really?
You can't trademark just a word; but you *can* trademark a word in relation to a specific type of product or service in order to protect your brand.  You can trademark anything in this way, even a color.  For example, T-Mobile has a trademark on their magenta color.  If another phone service provider used that color, they would be infringing on that trademark.  This is to protect the brand and prevent people from confusing the brands.  Similarly, the Fine Bros are trying to trademark the word "React" in relation to the types of videos they make.  The issue is that the wording of the trademark they filed seems very broad.  As though they are trying to trademark any video that features people reacting to anything.
Which number? :P

That's the whole point.... They are taking down people videos because they think they own reaction videos.  Its extremely wrong and greedy.... You can't own something that basic and simple.

Paper check register. I only write maybe 2 or 3 actual paper checks per year, but it is still the way to keep track of my checking account balance.  Paper grocery list. Held on to the fridge with a magnet, just write the thing down as I run out or get a craving for a meal.   My backup to the contact list on my phone (yes, I have a smartphone. Hate the damned thing) is kept on paper at home.   Dedicated alarm clock on the nightstand. Sure, it's digital and runs on electricity and stuff, but it serves only one purpose. I also doubt it will last 19 years like the one it replaced.  Mobile internet is utter garbage, so when I think of something during the day, I write it down on a piece of paper and google it when I get home.   I pay cash for things in the sub-$10 range.   Prefer paper maps to the phone apps (which fail completely for longer road trips)  No cloud-based anything. I don't know who owns those servers, and don't trust people I don't know to protect my data. Backups are on thumb drives stored in my house.   TLDR: Old-fashioned, manual ways are generally easier and work better.
You'll start throwing money at your TV!
http://imgur.com/a/BYoGP Here is a quick series of visual aids I put togeather showing the Idea I'm trying to describe 
The gender warriors so keen to make everything a fight between men and women (despite the fact that the majority of those whose jokes she stole were women). She'll get away with it by continuing to make bank from others' creativity instead of being reduced to a laughing stock (but not in a way a comedian wants) like Carlos Mencia.
I'd highly recommend Bill Bryson's *A Walk in the Woods.* He's a travel writer, and it's about him and his friend hiking the Appalachian trail. 
doh. coding bootcamp.
It's 12 monkeys. I was onthe edge of my seat the whole time, after i watched i couldn't think about anything else for days. Shawshank was just good and feely.
Wishing physical harm on another is just shitty, period.   I just hope they have a bad game from all the travel and tough fixtures leading up to the finals.

None of them wants to hang out with those loners.
Why are you bringing up the bible? That's a different conversation. Why the sidestepping and hijacking? There's no innate distrust or dislike of Arabians or Africans coming from the majority of westerners. It's the superstition. It's the book. 
Its funny how that can apply to real life. Yesterday I woke up, got out of bed and stepped over all my dirty clothes. I said "Oh fuck this" and did 4 loads of laundry that day. I even put it all away! 
I'm playing a CI Block reave build, currently 87 thc and with less than 1ex in gear I can easily solo up to t11 maps (havn't found any higher)  my dmg is still a bit low due to crappy wep/gear, but im basically unkillable unless i play downright retarded with dmg mods on the map.  block is a defensive option that is best on melee builds since the surrounding node are very much geared towards melee dmg.  While block alone is not a good option, it also is paired with good shield nodes, which can give very handsome defenses.   My build is also CI (it doesn't have to be), which gives me more EHP than most block based chars would get (I have 8.2k), and about 12k defense without flasks or endurance charges. 
I think I will keep mine. I will just get a $11 Roswill adapter. The one in my part list is just a placeholder.
Thank you for reminding me she exists. What a special woman she is.
Who the fuck upvoted this racist bullshit
If you would like to know the real truth, bernie is actually the biggest liar by implying to young, college aged children that his policies will become reality if he is elected.
remember that the daily grind of "you're a liar" and "I don't agree with you" are violence against women now.
Or maybe you could take a moment to reflect on how you might be causing this and how you can avoid it in the future. Ignoring someone would be the first step. 
I like to make people happy and if that means finding humour in something to spare their feelings then so be it, but generally yes I laugh easily 
This was a metaphor for do good work and get a better job.

Does Reddit dislike reaction videos?  I'm not a big YouTube user, so not super familiar with these, but the few I've seen were pretty entertaining.  I can see the appeal.
OMFG I'm a moron lol! Sorry about that... 
That's what I'm thinking too. Those are great questions to ask her. She may even be able to ease my mind about it and maybe we can arrange things differently than the couple did in the video I saw. 
Ha. What moment was that?
Grey stays away from commenting on bs stuff like this. But Fine Bros has F up so much that they gotten someone has neutral as Grey to make fun of them.

The low damage of weapons and silhouetteing are two of the biggest draw backs of the game for me. Also on the list cheating/glitch, teaming and inconsistencies. Forgot to add POVs in BR with no loot to that list. I.e. Military base and hospital.
My first Android device was a Barnes and Noble Nook Simple Touch. Once it's rooted and you get multitouch and fastmode working, it's really useful. It runs an old version of pocket, that I use all the time, and with fastmode it's actually great for playing gameboy games (and of course it's great for reading ebooks).
[](/lunateehee)Thank you.  Will she be alright?
Would you rather have fleshed out and neat content or have them rush to the closest release date and cut a lot of things like they did for WoD?
We welcome any american researchers in the Russian labs. The USA is the probably the most advanced nation regarding medicin and with the very liberal Russian laws we might be able to develop a cure.
