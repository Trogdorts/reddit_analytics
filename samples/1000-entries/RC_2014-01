No, they're Ukrainian. They were a part of the USSR until 1991 and a small percentage of the population is Russian, but that's about it.
Try the burner app.  Developed just for this. 
Well, I like the idea of lesser known but mid-high end brands because that would be a small touch that would add to luxury to the store. But as far as availability, I would stick with the big names like OPI. They're much more affordable and I can splurge on those easily.

The weekend before Veteran's Day my husband and I had dinner at a buffet. We decided to pay for the meals of two gentlemen that appeared to be Vets. This is the first time I told anyone this.

Thanks.  It's not my natural style, but not using slang has left me out in the cold and caused social pain and isolation all my life.  I'm just trying to start to learn slang so that I can adapt it to what "most people" can relate to...although it feels very strange given my age.  I've also found that I'm also stale when discussing my interests (writing, music, philosophy, psychology). I just don't get banter at all, especially the kind existing between close friends and in relationships.
I didn't think it was too bad. I kind of liked it actually. The ending was fairly cool too, and Season II's announcement made up for it!  This was actually a decent "recap" type episode. (and it did say this episode was going to be mostly a recap.) 
Me too. It burns forever and it will burn the shit out of you even through 2 inches of ceramic.  Again, not that I'd know. 
I hadn't ever heard of them before joining this subreddit. They're not really a big thing in the US, but are apparently very common in many European countries.  A menstrual cup is a small silicone cup with a grip on the bottom (usually a small stick, though some companies offer ball and ring grips too) that you fold up and stick in your vagina; it pops open and catches your menstrual fluid. You empty and rinse it every 12 hours and then reinsert, and sterilize it in boiling water at the end of every cycle. Unlike a pad or a tampon, it can be reused for multiple cycles - some companies boast their cups will last 10 years.  [Diva Cup](http://divacup.com/) is probably the most popular / common brand, but I prefer [MeLuna](http://www.meluna.ca/) because they offer the great variety of sizes and grip styles.  Edit: Just realized in linking to the MeLuna site that the FDA has changed regulations regarding menstrual cups and they can't ship to the US until they get approved. Their FB page says that won't happen until next July at the earliest. Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.

It's very difficult to get in the states, and is highly over priced. Royal Purple synthetic has been used in RX-8 engines for years with no reported cases of it being an issue. For the price of one liter of synthe-renesis, you can buy a half dozen or more liters of Royal Purple or another brand.  http://m.rx8club.com/showthread.php?t=249264&amp;styleid=21  Edit: Tldr, you can use synthetic in rotaries and it won't kersplode any more often than conventional. 
Crates. Are they both ok with being in a crate? You are going to have to get used to doing some real management of space with those two.   I have had friends who managed a household with multiple dogs with severe aggression. You basically have to have an armed camp mentality about the two dogs. Understand that if they currently are fighting and they don't live together, this won't improve when they have to share space.   Designate one room as the Chow's room and the other for the Shar Pei. Keep a crate in each one. Rotate the dogs out for time with you guys: if you're watching TV, take one dog out, and hang out with him. After an hour, put that dog back in his room, and get the other dog.   Don't be fooled for one minute that all of a sudden thru some magical nonsense or other that they will love each other. That's how people wind up in the ER with the plastic surgeon getting lots of stitches. Once you guys are living together, and you take them for walks on neutral ground, you can see if they still, no matter what, are aggressive towards each other. If they are, understand that that won't change, especially if you can not afford a trainer. If they seem to be more or less ok with each other, you can gradually increase time together in the house, but **not** when there is food around.   The reason why I am so cautious is that dogs tend to learn from fights with their housemates. They learn to hate each other more, so you really don't' want it to get to that stage.   The reason for the crate in a room is in case you have that clueless friend who wanders in and wants to let Fluffy out to chill with Muffy. A locked crate is usually a deterrent even to the most derpy of friends. 
Happy new years to you too! And added! :)

I find it super hot.  but the actual execution can be difficult and ultimately not orgasm-inducing.  But there's always times I look at a girl at go "god I want to lay my cock between those and go to town".  I think the best experience i had was when a rather blessed girl wore a sports bra and I kinda' tittyfucked her tits through her sports bra.  Lots of lube/lotion.  lots of tongue and head licking.  It was more sensual than pleasurable.

I agree... I think Tuel eventually starts. 
We were in our early 30s and lived together so we already had an apartment full of stuff and had our honeymoon sorted out so we just asked for cash. I forget it we said it was for our honeymoon or not. We had actually already paid for the honeymoon so i think a lot of it just went into our mortgage. It's not particularly exciting but taking a decent chunk off your mortgage can be quite beneficial for your long term happiness.  Receiving it was, however, quite exciting. We put out a small suitcase at the reception that my wife had decorated which we took with us when we departed. It was a day time wedding so we left at 4pm and had plenty of time and energy left to do the deed in the wedding dress before sitting around drinking champagne, eating cake and counting a suitcase full of money while giggling like school kids.  There were certainly plenty of people who complained about it feeling impersonal. I'm not sure how buying something from a store is more personal but anyway... We stuck to our guns, reinforced that we absolutely did not need anything and asked them to include a card that expressed how they felt so we got a lot of lovely messages from people.

Is it useful to think of human capital as a resource, I heard they are now fighting wars to win "hearts and minds".   There are physical resources but also human resources, wars are fought for both. For example, it is very difficult for an external geographic polity to (exploit) gain profit from accessing an external territories physical resources without the complicity of the local population. So "hearts and minds" become a very valuable resource worth fighting for.  If we consider religious wars as primarily ideological, establishing a groups cultural supremacy over a region, could we extend the reasoning to political or capital motivations (what's the difference?). In all cases it seems the outcome biases the available resources an individual can extract from their local environment - individual's affiliated with the dominant cultural group in a region will find it easier to extract, both physical and social, resources from the local environment.  Religion, like political and economic ideology, may be a mechanism used, historically and currently, to coerce less powerful individuals of a polity to do the bidding of the elite - a way to generate and control the behaviour of large, geographically distributed, populations. An enduring form of polity management, if you will.
Funniest moment **HAS TO BE** "a little POV".
Of course there is, theres always time for a player to come good. At first we sympathised with him, as our midfield play was poor. But with Ki, Giach and even Catts all playing relatively well, he is getting service.  The problem is, he is having the ball played to his feet, with his back to goal, giving defenders time to close him down and force his hand (foot). Usually meaning he spoons it into the stands, or is tackled. If he made short runs, or got into space, it would be SO much easier for him. Plus missing clear cut chances, and very very rarely taking shots (Ki, Bardsley, Colback and AJ shoot more than he does), it feels he is a wasted position.  Get into space Jozy, make runs, get your balls back and start shooting. If you shoot 20 times a match, and score 2....YOU'VE SCORED TWO!!!
Thanks. I made it up, that's how I got over my first heart break. 
He put other people's lives at risk. I hope he dies. Same goes for people who text while driving.  I was driving to the store today and almost got a late xmas present when a landwhale walked in front of my car without even fucking checking left and right. Needless to say, bitch remembered how to run when she finally saw me after I had already slown down.  Had I been texting while driving at that moment, her ass would have probably eaten my grill, which would have been partly my fault.  But what really grinds my gears is the fact that I would have been held responsible even if I hit her for understandable reasons such a blind bend..
Listen to this guy, he's a doctor.
I'm guessing your last update was to MF3? The latest one is to 4.3, so I assume it just brought 4.3 features, along with updated bloat. I'm not sure if there was another 4.2.2 update to add Gear capability, or if that was just with the 4.3 update, but I know one of them did. AT&amp;T can go fuck themselves for locking the bootloader and patching every known exploit.
With any kydex holster you can always take a hairdryer and heat it up (with the gun in it, unloaded.)  And reshape the areas that contact for retention.  I had to do this occasionally with my IWB holster for my 1911.  Heat it up and press down right in the trigger well. Retention would increase two-fold.  Problem solved.

Water, and beef jerky to the extent I can afford it. Jerky is filling and quite healthy, and making sure 80% of my fluid intake is water goes a long way toward keeping me in reasonably good shape.

you will want to wait until you have all of your tax documentation before you do your taxes, w2s, 1099s, etc.  Even if you have that, the govt will not start processing tax returns until 1/28/14.  Depending on how you file, it would be a week to 2 weeks after they process to get your return.

How does this create a bigger obstacle for women only?  If my wife (who kept her name) purchased a ticket, she couldn't transfer it to me any more than I could transfer it to her.  If we had children, and they carried my name, she couldn't transfer it to them.  If they carried her name, I couldn't.  Seems completely even. This is a policy that is clearly designed to reduce fraud.  And there doesn't seem to be an easy way around it.  If you open it up so that the spouses need not share each other's name, but still want to ensure that only couples take advantage of the option, then you need to arrange for people to provide proof of marriage.  I don't have the first clue where my marriage certificate is, and even if I did, I don't like the idea of some random airline having a copy of it.  But, assuming you get past that issue, now we can start talking about how to deal with common-law folks.  After all, excluding them because of religion isn't fair either.  So what for them?  Perhaps submitting last years tax statements?  Selfies in front of the house? The fact that it comes in contact with a women's issue (taking a husband's last name) does not inherently make it sexist.  In this particular case, it is simply practical.  
Dear mods, If every fucking thread has people complaining about the whole "just because it's well done doesn't mean it isn't shitty" situation then it may be time to rethink that rule. How long do we have to deal with these complaints before something is done about it?

http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-transfer-latest-liverpool-6458058  &gt; Meanwhile, Liverpool have dismissed reports in Spain that Barcelona winger Cristian Tello will be heading to Anfield on loan for the rest of the season. &gt;  &gt; Tello, who rejected the chance to join the Reds on a season-long loan in the summer of 2012, has found his opportunities limited under Gerardo Martino this term. &gt;  &gt; That has led to speculation that the 22-year-old could move on in January. &gt;  &gt; Liverpool did enquire about his availability but they are now looking at other options.
For the naming part, I keep the names of my legions the same as they start as, simply because I didn't know you can rename them LOL. It gets pretty confusing when Legio XVI of Africana is all the way in Gaul.  I basically follow the natural flow of the gameplay, seeing as how random factions declare war on me at random times. I try to crush the minor factions first allowing for the major ones like Carthage and Egypt to get bigger so that in the inevitable future war, the battles get epic.  And lastly, my web of alliances is honestly how I'm feeling at the moment, usually though for me, it's trade with the nations far from me and war with the minor factions and the bigger nations when it gets to late game.

Nice one man, but I feel you may have over done it a wee bit  If you want to convince someone what they're saying is ignorant then calling them ignorant is a good way to make that person stick their fingers in their ears and pretend they can't hear you  The problem isn't that this person is ignorant (We all are at some point or another), the problem is that this person is ignorant AND  arrogant. She believed the things she was told and simply repeated what she thought was fact.   If we Ents want Marijuana to be positively accepted then we must understand a lot of people were lied to by authoritative figures.

&gt; ...Though I would be in favor of having a little bit faster game schedule, were we to restart. Seems like an awful lot of waiting.  True, but some people actually have lives that do not bend to the will of mafia (crazy, I know.) Plus it's easier on players who are new, and gives room for game extras like RP.
Maybe not in Age of Ultron but they'll probably be in the third one.

It starts off the first 5 levels as snowflakes with different coloured backgrounds.  5-9 I think it just stays a snowflake with blue background, then at 10 it turns into a cabin.

&gt; Yes I'm familiar with "Eternal September" and other elite buzzwords used to denigrate democratic management of content.  Dude, that's a biased, superficial, and simply fallacious understanding of the term. **First**, the social content is democratically produced both *before* and *after* any Eternal September effect. (Example: reddit policy did not substantially change before/after its own ES.) Thus ES cannot possibly mean what you think it to mean, to "denigrate democratically-produced content"—the two are totally orthogonal concerns (they don't imply the other).  **Objectively**, Eternal September is just a social phenomenon. Any thoughtful person would realize there are both desirable and undesirable aspects to website/forum scaling. In particular, and you conveniently gloss over this point, it is important to understand that  *lowest-common-denominator*-produced content is not the same as *democratically*-produced content—that's the moral of the story of Eternal September. Does that make sense so far? So, while ES is sometimes used *by* some smart but elitist redditors, there is nevertheless an underlying reality for what's going on. The phenomenon is what matters for analysis.  **More generally**, content quality is always evaluated separate from the content system, not the other way around. In your sloppy reasoning you have conflated the two without  *justification*.   **Even though you claim familiarity, you didn't raise nor acknowledge any of these 3 basic issues. I did. See the difference? I'm just saying, maybe you should think on this a little, before continuing to claim there's something wrong with what I've said and continue to say.**

Literally, anything positive that you can force yourself to do everyday (or at least often). Too many people make plans for the New Year, only to fall short of them because they lack the proper motivation.   You wanna take up crocheting? Awesome, send me some mittens.  You wanna code? Cool, let's build a website together.  You wanna lose weight/workout more? PM me, and we can keep each other on track.  People have literally made websites where you can [find new things to learn](http://noexcuselist.com/everything).  Whether you choose to better yourself mentally or physically, just do something to better yourself. Any progress is forward progress.

I honestly didn't give how tall I was any thought until a few weeks ago, I'm 19 now (and about 6'5, probably more, haven't checked in at least a year, probably 2). I was just thinking about stuff and I realised, I've only looked up at a few rare very tall people in the last few years, everyone else I look down at. And I can see over most walls I would have struggled climbing when I was a kid.

Leica, voigtlander, Fuji, and the like will survive in the digital market. This article ignores the existence of rangefinders. They will definitely continue to exist in the professional and prosumer markets. I think that Olympus will probably survive by moving in to that market.  Also, pentax will probably grow its share in the dslr market. I've liked what I've seen from them the past few years. They also make fantastic glass.

[My 2013 Year on YouTube.](http://imgur.com/xoc4Ufb.jpg)  Overall, this was a rebuilding year for my channel.  Pre-2013, my channel was mostly for Mario Paint videos and original music.  This was the first full year on YouTube where I did Let's Plays. There was never a goal of subscribers or views (as you can see, Mario Paint videos are still more popular then any of my LP videos).  I only had one goal for 2013, and that was to upload every day.  And I pretty much did that.  [Here is my upload schedule for 2013.](http://imgur.com/2Esj1JV.jpg)  Besides two days in February, I achieved what I had set out to do.  I celebrated 1 year of Let's Plays in October, and I'm about to start my 13th game in my main LP series.  Here's hoping all that rebuilding pays off in 2014. - - - - - Hopefully you enjoy! ~bb

Franklin and Washington were d-bags, actually.  Washington should've stepped down for the incompetent commander that he was.  He was actually almost replaced during the war, but lucked out in squelching his replacement's letters and getting others to turn against him.  Franklin had special interests in monetary printing and manipulated the Quakers.  What stood out to me the most, though, in *Conceived in Liberty* was how disgusting the governors were to the natives (poisoning chieftains at peace dinners, murdering peaceful tribes that were trading or, at times, saved colonists from starvation) and how the Puritans would torture to death many pacifist Quakers.

Modern religions are dumb too. The difference is that modern religions have plenty of social pressure encouraging people to join in, which is a very powerful force and can overcome a lot of common sense. People who go for pagan mythology, on the other hand, have no excuses.
Yeah its pretty racist that a white guy got a cold shoulder from a black dude.  Seriously get the fuck outta here. You don't have to deal with institutional racism on a daily basis and be constantly harassed by the police and you have plenty of representation in the political arena. Fuck you kid.
&gt; Show me a minimum wage worker that will argue against a minimum wage increase because it would potentially be to the detriment of the company they work for. I'll bet that person doesn't exist.  TBH, that's probably because most of those people don't understand the consequences. A company that employs 1000 workers at minimum wage, won't employ 1000 at minimum wage + $1. If this company were to tell its employees that it's raising wages by $1, but also firing these specific 100 people in the process, you'd have 100 people who wouldn't want the wage increase. Likewise, if McDonalds and all of the other fast food joints told their employees who's getting laid off should a minimum wage increase be instated, guess who's not voting for that? Of course anybody wants a wage increase when they're under the assumption that they still keep their job.

&gt; A bitcoin is worth a boombox or a goat or seven hundred dollars.  If only that were true! Everyone figures out what they want to make in dollars first and then back figures what that is in bitcoins. Over the one year period when bitcoin went from $10 to $1000, did merchants keep their BTC/goat prices the same? Because I'm guessing the USD/goat price stayed much flatter.  &gt; Bitcoin doesn't need fiat currency to exist.  It most certainly does. At least at this point in time and for the foreseeable future it does.  &gt; The euro can be priced in terms of dollars too, but that doesn't mean it's backed by dollars.  Because inside the eurozone they don't use dollars to buy and sell things, and for the most part they don't care what the current exchange rate is. Fluctuations between those currencies directly impact some areas like imports/exports/tourism, but those take a while to adjust and don't immediately impact the rest of the economy. With bitcoins everyone immediately adjusts their prices for everything to match dollars every second. Imagine the equivalent, a european supermarket where prices were really based in dollars and their prices in euros changed every second based on what the euro was currently trading at. Now imagine every single aspect of the entire eurozone being immediately tied to and converted back to the dollar, then yes, I'd say the euro was backed by the dollar.  As I said before, the only reason these stores exist is because they can currently get their bitcoins out into some fiat currency. So in that case, yes, bitcoins are backed by fiat currencies. If Euros couldn't be exchanged for dollars, people inside the eurozone wouldn't immediately stop using euros.

How can you be so certain? I thought there was human interaction when throwing out bans.  There is still a MASS number of people banned unjustly. Please look at your detection engine a bit more.  From what I have gathered, AVG users also gets banned or something like that.  "Those who desire to have security over freedom end up with none of the two" - Look it up. I switched from Avast to AVG because it gave toooooo many false positives, I think your cheat detection system does the same.  Result, while there might be no cheating, you significantly gut out a major amount of your population (most of whom are innocent).

Your gaps between the traces and the ground are *tiny*. I would open those gaps up and also use wider traces than those tiny ones. No need on a board like this to have any gaps or traces less than 20 mils or more. This is not an RF board so you don't need a complete ground plane as long as it's all connected somehow. You can achieve that by adding vias in areas where the ground plane appears on both sides (the vias are good practice anyway. They don't add appreciable cost)

Youtube will not remove the videos. Seriously, they only remove videos if there is half a second of boobs (and maybe the entire channel).  Copyright infringment? They will not believe you.

They are not as effective as missile AA, but what they can do is get a point or two of damage in a relateively short time, which in conjuncture with a high HE SAM can be effecient.   Example:   8HE missile + 8HE missile = 6 HE wasted to kill plane  8HE missile + a few seconds of AAA = dead plane   Use them to supplement, but don't rely on them. You can get buy fine with just SAMs.

I don't really think its fair that you argue about anarcho-capitalism whilst not knowing even the most basic aspects...  &gt;If Columbus lands on a new continent, is it legiti­mate for him to proclaim all the new continent his own, or even that sector “as far as his eye can see”? Clearly, this would not be the case in the free society that we are postulating. Columbus or Crusoe would have to use the land, to “cultivate” it in some way, before he could be asserted to own it. This “cultivation” does not have to involve tilling the soil, although that is one possible form of cultivation. If the natural resource is land, he may clear it for a house or a pasture, or care for some plots of timber, etc. If there is more land than can be used by a limited labor sup­ply, then the unused land must simply remain unowned until a first user arrives on the scene. Any attempt to claim a new re­source that someone does not use would have to be considered invasive of the property right of whoever the first user will turn out to be.  http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap2d.asp#12._Property_the_Appropriation
VAC is fundementally broken, sure it catches those who use public hacks in a very blatant matter. But anyone who can stockpile accounts can also buy a 20 dollar private cheat, which aren't detected (unless they recycle code, which only a shitty hack would do). VAC's main purpose is to discourage cheating, and banning first offenders that are stupid enough to use public hacks.  Overwatch for the most part does what it is designed for, but the cheaters and false positives far outweigh the people reviewing cases.   A lot of good suggestions have been made, but please, never for a second think VAC will PREVENT cheating.

I tended to abuse Adderall XR. I haven't touched it since college. I read Delivered from Distraction, and it kind of put things into perspective for me, about finding areas of life where my ADHD would be an advantage rather than something to hold me back. Hence, I work in a restaurant. I thrive in the chaotic atmosphere. And this writing. I really get into the writing. I don't think I'd be able to if I wasn't ADHD.

But here:  http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/AAA-Offering-Free-Tow-Service-to-Tipsy-Drivers-Celebrating-New-Years-Holiday-237812911.html  That's just an example for my state.  I've searched other states where AAA is available, and they're all doing it.  Some are calling it "Tipsy Tow" and other states are calling it the "Tow to Go" program.  So, before you make a snarky remark.  Make sure you're actually correct.

Ya exactly and I guarantee you that our Sierras will out-handle that Dodge, plus they have a slightly smaller body, better turning radius, lower stance and aren't hard to park at all.  Moral of the story is that you can't judge an entire class of vehicle from one make or one model, it's like driving a GT40 and deciding that you hate all sports cars without even trying a BRZ, miata, M3 etc. There are many different flavors of vehicles.

Snow days: worst. I missed an employment interview on a snow day, I'd actually gone out an hour early because I was worried about it. But the bus drivers hadn't been authorized to put on their tire chains, so they all stacked up at the grade on 10th Ave. I could have walked it if I'd known.
Lol. It's gotta be 22. I've got 2 sisters. They both 22, They both twins. They both got 11 kids. 2x11 = 22.  BOOM!
1st congrats on moving to a new area for and getting a good job. (Doing the same myself)  I asked because the biggest factor for housing cost is location.  The avg home in '74 was somewhere around $35k so your father bought a lower end home, was in a low priced location, or got a great price. All would make since for a 1st time home buyer. Buying in any major city doesn't make since to me unless you are certain you'll be there for a long time. The prices are just too high.

&gt;Because they read from right to left,  Correct me if I'm wrong, but they read right to left in vertical writing (so really top to bottom, then right to left). For horizontal they read left to right in modern times. In fact, 英雄联盟, along with the other horizontal writing in the client, is read from left to right.
Get real drunk and make mistakes. I'm a master at it.
All news sources are biased. Having said that one can go back to the original memo in the links and draw ones inferences from there. My conclusions follow broadly the same pattern as the linked article but if you see things in a very different way please do discuss, we should all be debating this.

Good. That would have been a rookie mistake
Interesting question. I would guess not, but whether it's possible or not please don't try to learn tonight :)

Don't let scarcity of position scare you away from picking the big names that dominate year to year.
Actually you're pretty much wrong.  Try using that google all the kids are talking about!
Downvoted. You're exactly what's wrong with /r/starcrafcirclejerk. Instead of posting satire, mocking starcraft and being clever and original, you continue to post lame phrases and beat to glue anything that was even remotely funny, all under the guise that you want to show what's wrong with starcraft. You don't care about starcraft. You belong to the system that this subreddit was made to mock. You seek karma. You seek to be a power-user, a well-known name in a sea of perpetual anonymity. The higher your karma-count, the more you get off on it. You are smug and self-satisfying. You are the problem. There should be a "delete" button below your posts. Start clicking them after you post and you'll find that starcraft starts to improve.
That's not the case, though. If a comedian goes onstage and bombs, the comedian can't just holler "THE AUDIENCE HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND!" Because it's the comedian's problem that no one laughed. Seriously, Krahulik could have said a thousand and one things to temper the situation and keep his artistic integrity or whatever, but instead he went for a hundred and one things that made it all worse.

Hi everyone! I literally have no idea what is being discussed here. Would anyone care to put this into a paragraph of ALMOST condescendingly basic terms? Any help appreciated, and have a happy New Year!
Wow. Youre late.
I'm stating the facts? Don't know how that's whining, but I'm upset so I might appear that way sorry
Thanks man.
I bought the game earlier today because of the steam sale and it didn't really catch my interest. Specifically, the bolt-actions didn't feel satisfying to use like they did in the original. I thought I would have enjoyed it more because I spent hundreds of hours playing RO when it was just a ut2k4 mod and then later when it was a retail release. 
Wifey is working the bells and probably won't be back until about 3am. I'll most likely be asleep on the sofa, headset tangled around my neck, beer soaked jeans and a dog shitting in the living room because I was too drunk to take it out. On that note, taking the dog for a walk.
When I was your weight I was cutting at ~1300 a day while exercising. Just drop lower, and look at how you are really measuring food.

I have the feebas you want with 4IVs and I think a different nature and mist instead of haze. Idk about the ball.  Not the best but could come in handy for breeding
You came to the right place. 
Already have Dark Souls and I have no interest in any of the others.
I can honestly have anything.  I get lots of good averages in silence, I get just as many with music on.  I also don't mind talking, or random background noise because I have that at competitions.  I've trained for that by Cubing at lunch ;)
I agree that if we are to have a min wage, it should be tied to inflation or else like you said it would fall in real value every year.  However, I guess then the real point for discussion is how much minimum wage should be able to cover.  I think it should be able to cover just enough for shelther and food IF you are living smart. This means, no extras such as cable tv (admittingly some sort of internet should be part of the min), no data plan for your cell, basic clothes, 1 ply toilet paper, etc.  Of course depending on the city, we would probabbly need to adjust the minimum wage for that as well since the cost of living for each city can vastly vary.  The problem of increasing min wage so much that people can afford luxuries creates an allocation problem.  Lets use the extreme example of saying some how the left gets min wage such that someone can afford a small house, with a wife and 2 kids.  Well shit, if that is the case, there is going to be a rush for anyone to get the easiest jobs possible because for many, that is all they want in life.  Now the medium hard jobs that paid this much before the min wage increase will now see a shortage because all of the people who were working those jobs went to the easy jobs.  The issue here is that people tend to be rational in the sense, they look at effort and reward. Every rational person would want to get the most reward for the least effort. This is also why communism will never work.
Shit you replied, pretty sure you don't have to anymore, heh.
I did/do have a fear of people knowing. Until earlier this year I did not speak of what had happened to me. It took me almost 12 years to speak of it. Now the people closest to me know but it was extremely hard to tell them. Once I told them and realized that they are still behind me and love me lifted a huge weight off of my shoulders.  The guy that unexpectedly came into my life earlier this year flipped my world upside down. Until him I accepted that I was going to be single my whole life (I also had vaginismus to the point that I could not even use a tampon) and I was fine with that. Once my ex came in I got the courage to face my past and change my future.  I have accepted what had happened in my past but I do worry how future SO's will take it. I dont think they will see me as dirty but as broken... does that make sense?? Although I have accepted what has happened I want it to be my past, I do not want it to influence any part of my life anymore. I fear that I will be looked at as broken, not strong, fragile, someone that a person has to tip toe around. Which to me is weird because I like being submissive in bed.... it doesn't make sense to me and that is another reason where I feel that they cannot be connected. I don't want to be viewed as fragile but I want a loss of control.  My life changed so fast and dramatically this year I haven't really had time to process it all I guess. Now that the guy that changed everything for me and was with me every step of the way is not with me anymore I really don't know how or what to say to future boyfriends. Not long after we broke up I purposely went and had a one nightstand to prove to myself that I could. Im sorry I am rambling on.... not sure if any of this stuff makes any sense or if it is even relevant. I guess when I posted all of this I was hoping for agreement and validation that what happened to me is in my past and no longer has any affect on me. Not sure where I go from here.  I am so sorry all that had happened to you... I cant even imagine. If you don't mind me asking how long ago was that? Do you think with more time it will have less of an impact on you? Thank you for taking the time to respond. I really appreciate it.
Does it have HP Fire?
I'll keep my eyes open for one! I live in Ontario, and our LCBO only carries them in 4-packs as far as I know. :( 
That 2009 draft netted like 7 starting PG's that are still in the league today, on top of another 5 backup PG's (good ones).  Rubio Curry Jennings Tyreke Evans (who played like a PG/hybrid guard his rookie year) Holiday Lawson Teague Patrick Beverley  Then you have Toney Douglas, the backup PG for the Warriors, Nick Calathes, and Patty Mills (Tony Parkers backup)  And James Harden who's like a hybrid 1/2 with the amount he takes the ball up and handles the ball.  To have THAT many PG's from one draft still starting and playing in this league, 4 years later, is fucking impressive.

You're intellectually inferior to me. There is no embarrassment here. You can't even comprehend basic arithmetic.  &gt;You're still trying to make it literal.  There is no context or example given here. So yes, I do have to take it literally. You've never taken introduction to philosophy.   Moreover, your archaic thinking is interesting to me. It's the 21st century and yet people like you still hold that mentality...  So let's take the following example:  Matt dates Katty. Katty dates Paul. Matt has friends, hobbies, etc.. and only "invest himself" 50% of his free time to Katty.  Katty does the same thing. For the remaning 50% of her free time, she decides to sacrifice piano class, and spend 20% of her time with Paul. Matt is the primary and Paul the secondary. Paul is fine with that arrangement. He's also dating Stephanie...  Got that? It's equal. 
Sweet. You sure you'll give it for a 4IV though? Lol
Your girlfriend studied some dental anatomy before making this, it's amazing.
Slartibartfast is the flavor. Personally, if I were to name a great place to get tobacco flavors.. I haven't found a better site than Vermillion River. I would suggest their cherry or apple tobacco, and samples are very resonable. Also, your first sample is free. Just pay $2.50 shipping within the US, if I remember correctly.
It may be hard for us to understand, but I am sure something like this would be priceless for those who need it.

Nobody cared about Iron Man before his movie. People thought Captain America was just a hokey joke before his movie. People thought the idea of introducing a Norse god into the Iron Man movie-verse wouldn't work. People expected The Avengers to fail horribly because it was too ambitious

Yeah, I figured as much. I guess what I'm really looking for is better children's shoes. My current dress shoes are literally made of plastic because that was all I could find at the time. They don't breathe at all and are uncomfortable as hell.  [Nordstrom](http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/boys-dress-shoes) has a start on what I'm looking for, though a lot of the shoes have this kind of chunky, sneaker-like sole that just screams "THIS IS A SHOE FOR CHILDREN" to me, or are made of substandard materials.

My wife almost broke down into tears one time watching an episode of that show.  It was a Halloween episode and Honey Boo Boo made some comment about how she loved that people dressed up as her for Halloween because it made her feel like people really liked her.  Nearly made my wife cry to think that one day she will realize that people don't dress up as her for that reason, but instead because they think its funny.
Aren't most of the mentions strongly negative though? I don't really read /r/gaming that often.

Yes it made people lazy, waiting for the lock to summon. But, it made the warlocks ability to summon more useful and needed.
This is really great. I believe that there is recolors of most of the core gear as well, or at least similar pieces so you could change a few things around to make a scarlet footman.
I recommend watching the whole thing. Very cool stuff.
I actually think it's weird that he wouldn't want to a death metal show so pissed off! We actually didn't have a drum machine back then so we took his floor toms and dicked around on stage making noise. We kicked him out when we returned his drums. He was lazy and never practiced so  we were kind of already thinking of doing it....but now he's in my black metal band....

Price is set by supply and demand. The supply curve is *heavily* dependent on cost.  If you're not through with school yet I'd recommend an extra couple of courses in basic econ. Having this stuff be intuitive to you is really valuable in life and will pop up all over the place.
That is true. I had forgotten about the pre-conservative years. So Trudeau? Trudeau seems like a nice guy in general.  Though I really want Harper out.
It's safe, as long as you don't mess around with anything other than the "safe daemons" or hide/delete preference bundles and dylibs that you still use.  People messing around with those had weird things happen to them which was why they were removed from the original iCleaner.
I was hoping to see the bearded guy that wore the Master's jacket a month or two ago in this thread, and he's there this month too in the picture with the James Bond filter, looking like he just walked out of The Matrix. Given this evidence, I assume joke fits are still allowed.

Here in beautiful Washtenaw County Michigan, we have the option to walk into any local grocery store Sunday to Sunday, any time a bar could serve, and purchase any type of libation we desire.  Beer, wine, hard liquor... single bottles, 40's and deucers, 6ers, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 beer cases.  Party stores typically will have 1/4 and 1/2 barrel kegs.  Liquor-wise we've got airplane bottles, half pints, pints, fifths, half gallons..  Pretty much anything to ease the pain of being a Michigander.

I long for the day when the announcers are taken off of TV broadcasts. Back in the day they were necessary, now they are a total waste of money for the stations. Stations have a graphic overlay for anything that we need to know, like the first down markers.  In my wildest dreams you could turn off the commentators like an alternate audio track and just listen to the sounds of the fans as they react to the game, and the stadium announcers would tell you everything that was necessary.  Rather than telling me that Peyton Manning is having a good game during a play let me listen to the fans and the sound of pads and helmets on my big screen with surround sound.  Announcers are a product of radio, let them stay on the radio.  Let me watch and listen to the game.

she doesn't understand ASD obviously.

I had literally never heard of it until this thread.  After a few minutes of looking into it, I have pretty much the same impressions you have.  /u/LaggFTW pointed out something interesting in a chat though - there's a lot of ship-related stuff coming out of Japan right now (he linked [this](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18893/Aoki_Hagane_no_Arpeggio:_Ars_Nova) as an example).  That really, really makes it feel like a fad, like what happened with bows in the US a year or two ago.  Someone who actually follows manga/anime probably knows better than me.  Besides Touhou and Megaten (I'm assuming Demon/Dark Souls doesn't really count), I follow pretty much no Japanese franchises.
My brother noticed the same thing when he was fourteen.  He had this to say on the topic.  The nice quiet guy gets hurt easily by rejection from a girl and he is less likely to ask out a girl he likes out for fear of further rejection.  Meanwhile that asshole guy no one likes always gets a girl because he does not care about rejection and asks a lot of girls out.  My brother marveled that the asshole always had a girlfriend and could not figure out why until he noticed that asshole always flirting while he had other friends who were crushed one time by a girl and lost their confidence.  Moral: don't let one rejection keep you from asking someone else out.

Can't argue with that. Cops need way more oversight, reprimand, and punishment when they shoot in error and injure or kill suspects or bystanders. There are absolutely a lot of cops who ought to be in jail for what they've done.

SHITTY CALL!  haha.. get it?  because it looks like a bunch of shit wiped onto the cloth?
It improved on everything wrong with 1 and 2, but totally fucked up everything good about 1 and 2. The earlier games were very slow paced and deep strategy games where civilization affected play style quite a bit, but didn't have a totally different play style, and that is how balance was so perfected.  3 was made in 2005, significantly before microtransactions were even a thing, but it just felt incomplete.  It looked pretty, sounded nice, and seemed to have solid mechanics, but it really fell apart as soon as you started playing it.  Block training made sense, but didn't work, part of the point of the early games was slow unit progression, it didn't want to just be another starcraft or total annihilation with huge armies and a bunch of explosions, it wanted to be something in which the conflict took place on a smaller scale and economy actually mattered quite a bit.  Much more defined civilizations seemed smart, but really just made it extremely difficult to balance, and difficult to balance often leads to poor balance, as shown in this game.  The city system looked to be a neat way to get more resources when the finite ones ran out, but ended up artificially gimping new players, and rewarding combat excessively.  The cannons were neat, but were kind of pointless, the only ones actually useful were mortars since they actually could fuck up buildings effectively.  Relying on different attack types for different purposes, instead of making everything based on resists and strengths seems to be smart but was bad too, ranged shouldn't have a viable way to defend itself at close combat, that is the whole point!

Whenever I look at these, I always think that in the best fits, people are way more out there with color combinations than I am.  I always get nervous about using warmer colors like reds and yellows, and almost exclusively stick to blues, purples, greys, and greens.  A lot of these fits make me think I should branch out more, but it also might be a personal style thing.
It may have to do with zoning more than anything. Like, if the dance club is zoned "commercial" as opposed to "residential" which on some level would define what is considered "public" and what "private".

&gt;Which would cause an increase in prices  Care to explain why?   The vast majority of goods are produced over seas(even of there is a "Made in Murica" stamp, the majority of the product was manufactured in a 3rd world country using cheap labor and goods). **Increasing the minimum wage for cashiers will hardly cause an increase in prices to someone like Wal-Mart, Target, Costco etc.**  I challenge you to present logic, reason and/or evidence to support your claim. This is a more reasonable way to make an argument.  &gt;$15/hour being the new $7.25/hour.  This is not very well thought out. Again, you can convince other people with evidence and/or reasoned logic.

&gt;Great Britain, Japan, and the Scandinavian countries left the gold standard in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the U.S., remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called "gold bloc", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935–1936. &gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Gold_standard  We're arguing semantics, I have the official date and you have the date the trade in practice was stopped.

Yeah, again, women shouldn't be speaking on what it means to be a man when they get such a narrow view of it and acting as if masculinity doesn't encompass those things. What you've listed has been integral parts of masculinity for eons, and quite frankly I'm getting real tired of women who claim that even anything close to 'most men' are frat boy douches who subscribe to what is best known as 'machismo'.   It's honestly sickening.

Well, it's new-years, and I have nothing better to do. Here goes!  ---  "Yes! It's working, it's finally working!" Twilight exclaimed, marveling at her creation.  Shining Armor stood a bit behind her, raising an eyebrow. "Uuh... What is it Twily?" he asked, taking a few steps forwards.  "It's... Well, it's a robot of sorts," she said, taking a step to the side to reveal vending-size machines, both with a screen and a tray for delivering something to the user.  "What's it do?" Shining asked, taking the last few steps forwards, then lightly tapping the machines with a hoof. "I mean, it looks a bit like a vending machine, of sorts..."  Twilight rolled her eyes. "I call it a Machinely Automated Giving International Cash machine, and its function is to-"  "A M.A.G.I.C machine?" Shining butted in, cutting off Twilight.  Twilight stared at him for a moment. "Yes, a M.A.G.I.C machine. And it's supposed to make cash withdrawals easy for anypony. Since it works automagically, one just has to put their hoof on the screen, then follow the directions on the screen and select how many bits they want to deposit, withdraw or transfer."  "And why did you make it?"  "I don't know. I felt it would be fun, but I doubt it'll be very long-lived," Twilight said, giving a little giggle. She grabbed one of the machines with her magic, then trotted outside. Shining smiled as he looked down the hall after her, then chuckled, shrugged and went on his way.  ---  ^^^^^Totally ^^^^^not ^^^^^inspired ^^^^^by ^^^^^you... ^^^^^Critique ^^^^^is ^^^^^always ^^^^^welcome.

Honestly, with the way things are on /r/Canada and a lot of other Canadian sub-reddits scares me. The amount of people that seem to have all the political, economical and social questions answered (with less than 2 years of actually being interested in politics) with their aggressive left wing agenda scares me.  But each time there is an election, they don't vote.... except for those rare times when the NDP some how wins when they should be left in the fringes with the Green Party.

You've gotten some answers, but here's a little more detail:  Like others have said, the first comment he makes is on the sum total of all the IVs.  Decent=0-90  Above Average=91-120  Relatively Superior=121-150  Outstanding=151-186  For the two you listed, you would notate them like this:  Honedge (1): x/x/x/x/31/31 (so, 2x31 IVs)  Honedge (2): x/31/x/x/31/31 (so, 3x31 IVs)  Now, what isn't known (at least, now that the Instacheck tool is dead), is how high all those Xs are.  The first one is "better", because those Xs are probably higher than the Xs of the second one.   I'd probably keep breeding though. Neither of them have a low speed (which you want in a Honedge) or a 31 Defense.  Edit: When you're ready, everything you need to know about breeding (nearly) is [here](http://i.imgur.com/ozfnbNv.png)

Fire Red came out in 2004. HG/SS 5 years later, and that was only 4 years ago. Since then we've had Black/White, B2/W2, and X/Y. Thats 3/6 releases in the last 3 years. They haven't exactly had much time to fit in a remake of Gen III.  Plus like blueferret98 said, there's not as much reason for a remake as there was Gen I and II, as III isn't cut off in the same way. The only real reason for one now would be the like of GBA slot on 3DS, like limasxgoesto0 said.

Sign up with a temp agency. Or agencies.   A LOT of companies hire exclusively this way now. In my mind it's great since both sides of the equation have the other on a probabationary status, so if it doesn't work out, there's no hard feelings and you just go back to said temp agency and say, "what else you got?"

Last beer I brewed in 2013: a best bitter with Green Bullet, Rakau and Wai-iti hops.  First beer I'll brew in 2014: my part of a group project of the local homebrewer meetup group: everyone brews the same Single Hop IPA recipe, but uses a different hops. I'll use Rakau, other people will do Calypso, Huell Melon, Comet, Mandarina Bavaria, and Cascade. That's something I'm seriously excited about!  And after that, I want to do a Mild, a Munich Helles, a historic 18th century Porter recipe, and redo my dry-hopped Hefeweizen.

Wow, this is a terrible circlejerk. 
I have a similar situation. My dad got remarried when I was 20 (I'm 24 now) but she has been around since I was 15.It's weird how she will get jealous when we talk about our mom, even though she has been dead 15 years. We don't even really talk about her that much but the times we do, she immediately tries to redirect the conversation to herself. She also gets jealous of the time I spend alone with my dad, which is not very often anymore. I am happy my dad is happy and all in all she is not that bad, but I wish she wouldn't act like that towards my late mother. My dad encourages her to talk about her ex husband, and has pictures of him up around the house. The only pictures up of my mom are in mine and my brothers old rooms. Even her daughter has noticed this and thinks it's strange of her mother to act this way. 
I second St Kilda  1. Definitely legally part of Scotland, not disputed.   2. So remote that there's stories of the locals being astonished when they were first shown apples in the mid 19th century.   3. Habitable, although inhospitable, a community survived there until recently and it now has activity in the form of nature conservation, science expeditions and military activity.   I discount Rockall because it's only had human habitation recently for the sake of claiming it, I would call it a big rock rather than a proper island.   http://qi.com/infocloud/st-kilda

People really oversell DC animated series. Spoiled by anime, DC animated looks like a dumbed down runt of a cartoon. Awful animation, average voice acting, and campy as all fuck with only mildly serious plot material that's never that emotionally engaging or thought-provoking.   I don't mean to be a dick, I just haven't seen a DC cartoon I could actually enjoy. The animation kills it for me more than anything. 
I tried to read the readme but there wasn't much in it. I was trying to figure out what exactly I could do with this library.  Is it for mining bitcoins, or would I connect it to a shopping cart to accept btc as a payment?  Also I'm trying to view it from a phone so I may just be missing something.

&gt;  It really used to be that companies were grateful...  It honestly doesn't even matter to me whether it was or wasn't better in the past. Employers not valuing their employees is something that needs to change, whether it was better in the past or not.   Btw, thanks for the story, I'm in a similar boat

How far did you read?
The example you gave perfectly shows my love-hate relationship with Facebook.  "Sorry, man. I'm at work/with my Mom/sick."  Two minutes later.....  "Woooo! Awesome night at the bar!"  I fall for it every time. I've slowly discovered that these "friends" of mine are simply drains on myself. I have unfortunately surrounded myself with a few people who constantly turn me down by lying or ignoring me and it really doesn't feel good.  Things turned around for me once I met my roommate. He is the kind of guy who is genuinely truthful when you ask questions and he will generally give straightforward answers. He also sucks at lying.  Once I got to get to know my roommate, he introduced me to people he knew, and my circle of friends has increased. If I want to hang out with someone, odds are good that someone is willing to hang out too now.  Not to mention these new friends don't expect me to pay for beer anymore.  Sure, I've thought about suicide, but for other reasons, and I don't see how killing oneself is going to show someone how they are a bad person. Killing yourself to stick it to one person is not a good idea. There are much less harmful ways to stick it to someone and you still get to see the results of your handy work. I DO NOT ADVOCATE THE RUINING OF ANOTHER'S LIFE.  Really want to show them? Call them out when you absolutely know they are avoiding you/hanging out. Let them know how you feel. Tell them that you'd prefer a straightforward answer instead of that dodgy bullshit. I prefer to be told, "Sorry, man. Out with Jim right now." That way I can go back to Reddit.  Don't expect them to constantly be available though. Set up hangout dates. Remember, if they are actually busy, then let them be. Don't pester them, they will see you as clingy. That will make things worse.Let them know you are available to hang out. When they want to as well, they will let you know.  I suggest finding someone who is truthful with you. Build your future relationships off of your experiences with them.  If you have any question, or just want to chit chat, feel free to fire away.

It could be location as well.  Around here, if someone got injured on the job because of lack of/improper safety equipment, they would be hit with huge fines, increased fees, and all sorts of bureaucracy by the worker's compensation board.  And I think beyond that, any fees that the worker's compensation board would normally pick-up (medical expenses, etc) would be past on to the employer.  Ya there was an area in the kitchen that had a thick rubber apron, [full face shield](http://www.toolstop.co.uk/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/SSP11E.V2.jpg), and insulated rubber gloves that went up to your elbow.  Though the rubber gloves got me because they didnt seal at the ends  to your arm (no elastic or anything), and every now and then a drip of grease would run in and hurt like a son of a bitch.  But a single drip is way better than getting splashed on.
Well, I love my girlfriend too much to say yes entirely, buuuuuuut... I'm super jealous of the other couples at school who don't have to worry about who sees them kissing and hugging in the hallways and don't have to worry about getting randomly yelled at or accused of being fake. Actually, if I was super straight or super gay I'd be happy. I usually identify as pansexual, but I'm not actually sure if I like guys or not because my current gf is the first person I held hands with, much less dated. It's the not knowing whether I like guys or just the idea of dating and being with a guy that really kills me because it makes me feel dirty and homophobic. And I'd also not so feel so pressured to lose my virginity just so I can "prove" my sexuality to myself and everyone else. Actually, you know what, if we're imagining, then I want to live in a world where everyone is pansexual, 'cause everyone would have a chance at loving everyone else and that would be awesome (I hope that doesn't offend anyone, I'm just joking, sorry). Also, I identify as femme, so I wouldn't feel guilty about not getting as much crap as my fellow heteros for not being butch or less feminine.

Not as far as I know. This works only when the Tivo gets a lineup update. When you change providers, there's no way for Tivo to know what channel corresponds to the new ones.  That's why the Todo list is empty. All the recordings on channels that have changed were deleted. Only channels that remained the same number would be retained.

I read this on a similar post, and it really hit home. The OP said something about how she gained a lot of weight, and felt ugly and that she had very little control over her outward appearance.   Until it came to makeup. She could choose colours and looks that made her feel pretty again. Spending the time making up her face made her feel like she mattered and had some control back.

So?  If they are both adults who is to say that she can't make her mind up about that.  I mean the argument is that adults should be able to make their mind up about it, right?

At least no discrimination against homosexuals.  They had the same marriage rights as straight people.

Yeah, just from the quick math: I'm assuming each season for the rest of their careers, they both go 12-4, or at least get the same record. Say Manning has 3 years left, Brady has 4. Manning would get 208, Brady would win up with 196. If he stuck around another year, he'd tie him. But I think when one retires, the other will soon follow.

I don't have exactly the same problem, but I've gotten a lot more aware of body language.  It's not always perceived the way we intend.  My problem is social anxiety.  In crowds, I'm nervous to the point of sweating and I'm always the one in the far corner hoping no one will talk to me (and at the same time wishing they would).  My SO has been helping me overcome it for years and recently made me aware of a bad habit I have.   When I'm nervous, apparently I unconsciously wring my hands.  For most people, that just looks like someone nervous, but I have large hands and since I'm tall, they're up higher so the gesture is pretty obvious.  What I've been told (now by several people) is that draws *more* attention to my size and looks vaguely threatening or intimidating.  Anyway, I'm working on what to do with my hands too.  At parties, I can at least get a drink and hold on to it.

&gt; imposing (or maybe enforcing) their will on another.  But to what end? Ideologies can spread without violence, but when they're spread by war resources are always a primary objective. The South's war to demand state's rights were specifically about maintaining slaves; the North fought to maintain its territory and resources. Nazis had their Lebensraum. Every camp that has gone to war to spread their ideology/religion has done it to gain resources.  Even religious wars are also primarily about resources, both directly and indirectly. The crusades themselves were about claiming [holy] land in the name of Christendom. Religious wars are also about affecting the marketplace of ideas by force. If I kill or forcibly convert all Sunnis there are more Christians or more room for Christians to expand. You only have to look at all the medieval Gothic cathedrals to see that religion was a lucrative business for those getting tithes &amp; handing out indulgences.  &gt;not much about acquiring resources  Wars usually have an aggressor and a defender. In this instance the War on Terror is supposed to be a defensive war against extremists to maintain the status quo, or to defend interests/assets/resources already held. The expense of the war could still be a good price to pay depending on how much you value preventing terrorist attacks, and if you could reason the War on Terror actually stopped potential domestic attacks.
I was in the same situation as you - dated several years, engaged for over one. I ended it two months before the marriage, for the exact same reason - complete sexual incompatibility. Hardest thing I ever had to do, but also the smartest. A year later, I met the perfect woman, and we've been married for 22 years.   By chance I ran into my ex fiancé about eight years after the break. We exchanged pleasantries, and I apologized again for ending it so close to the marriage. She smiled and said, "God, what a train wreck that would have been if we'd married."
That doesn't make any sense, though. Why would they open the movie with discussion over Thorin's father being lost as a plot point and then not resolve it in the same cut? I wonder if it was pushed into movie 3?

I was thinking the same thing. This isn't data, it's semi-abstract art.  I thought it was an actual study
Now, I wouldn't say that either of these people are breaking up simply because of "bad sex".  In both cases, there's a larger issue: Failure to compromise in light of the unhappiness of a potential spouse.  What I mean is, if the problem were simply "our sex isn't completely satisfying, but we're working on it," then it would be shallow to break off an engagement for that reason alone.  The problem is actually, "I'm unhappy about part of our life together, my significant-other knows I'm extremely unhappy, and yet he/she won't make any effort to improve things."  It doesn't really matter that the thing you're unhappy about is sex.  What matters is that your significant-other is disinterested in working with you on the problem.  And that *is* potentially serious enough to warrant breaking off an engagement.

I picked a bad month to stop drinking :). Between the open bar at the company Christmas party, going away party for a coworker, plus holidays has involved a lot of telling myself no. I am fine with my wife finding out, I'm just nervous. I don't want to make a big fuss of it, plus she doesn't know how much I was drinking (after she found my hidden stash for the third time she said she would stop looking for them/trying to monitor it). It is crazy how much I drank, and when (at work, driving, anywhere/everywhere), and telling her i stopped might bring up uncomfortable questions, discussions, and addition worry on her part of 'what if starts drinking again'.

Ic Ic....now i see you point better. Thanks for the explanation  I agree with mostly everything you've said. The only thing that i would disagree with that although riot is greedy, they're not overly greedy. I would say they are slightly above the average greed of any business.  Their model of generating revenue (imba champs, IP gain rates, etc...) is highly effective. Does that make them greedy, yes...does that make them super greedy? Not really. Other games have done far more greedier things generate revenue (look at any cash shop MMORPG and even TF2).  Does this justify any of the issues at hand (imba champs, Ip gains, revenue tactics) NO. Does this make Riot a horrible company? NO as well. It's how they do business and us users are left to decide to stay or leave.  And to be honest...in the last few weeks I've been looking for another game to play. My buddies and I ended taking our laptops to each other's house to have a lan party for BroodWars...LOL

I wasn't a fan of the flea flicker, but other than that we've done exactly what we're supposed to do with a big lead. What are these guys talking about?
Ezra Levant literally turns my stomach.
Flipping the question around, why is there a mentality that EVERY job SHOULD present a "liveable" wage? What constitutes a liveable wage?  If you're not dead yet, are you technically being payed a livable wage?  All you have to do to make more money is convince a business owner or manager that hiring you at $X an hour will benefit the business financially.  That's all there is to it.  But most people complaining about being stuck at minimum wage cannot make this argument.  Instead, they simply say "tell me where to be and what to do for 8 hours a day and sign my paycheck for $X".  Why?  "Because I'm a human being and I feel I am entitled to that."  Why are you entitled to that?  If you can answer that question with reason and logic rather than an appeal to emotion, you won't have to work for minimum wage.

To add to this, the IP will probably look like 192.168.*.* or maybe 10.*.*.* where * could be any number. 
Sorry but you can't bomb an idea.
Because not everyone needs to be earning a liveable wage. For example if a teenage wants a summer job or an after school job they do not need as much money. The thing most people don't consider when arguing that minimum wage should be raised is that when you raise minimum wage, the cost of living goes up with it. Companies don't have endless money, and they will always put profit margins first. So, they will either cut the hours of their current employees in an attempt to provide the same service with less labor and/or raise their prices to compensate for their raised labor expenses. So, sure, if all the cashiers who were previously making $8/hr were suddenly making $15/hr, they'd be getting a higher dollar amount for their time spent but they will either lose hours or end up spending more when they need to buy something due to raised prices.

Yes, evolutionary biologists have disagreements over details. But what *you* were saying is that there's something else in biology "besides evolution", and that we don't "know that evolution is correct".  You were saying something *completely fucking ridiculous*.

I just think it's stupid that people waste time bitching about this stuff.  The top wealthiest people in this country have been increasing their profits while the rest of America continues to bend over backwards for them. People need to be educated on whats going on, learn how to organize and band together to take out the people that are hoarding all the countries wealth.  What if we only purchased goods from "good" companies?  What if we got together and stopped purchasing items from certain store chains like walmart?  What if we got together and voted for people who would separate government and big corporations? I see all these great ideas.... but not a single fucking thing can get done because no one knows how to organize.
&gt; Early 90s computer user here. Hacker meant someone who was very clever with computers, including getting them to do things they weren't designed to do. This was not necessarily getting them to do things that they were designed not to do, although it could include that. It was just like if you could write code and use it cleverly for your own purposes in an "outside the box" way.  One of the best non-fiction books I've ever read is about this topic: *Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution* by Steven Levy.

&gt; there are no wealthy black communities in the United States  You've obviously never been to--among other places--parts of Washington, DC and Atlanta, or to their suburbs.

It's not the speaking that's hard, since I have a natural ability to match accents and put pieces together. It's the spelling. I can read a word easily, but if I hear something and try to spell it, it's extremely hard. There's the ç, the ã, etc. and some things have the same sound but are used instead of another letter just because. That's something I need to practice.

Interestingly, the natural logarithm can be interpreted as a way to translate between the multiplicative and additive structures of the real numbers. The interval (0, infinity) is closed under multiplication and the whole real line (-infinity, infinity) is closed under addition. A logarithm bijectively takes a number in (0, infinity) to a number in (-infinity, infinity) in such a way that the multiplicative identity (1) is mapped to the additive identity (0), and such that multiplication of two numbers is turned in addition of their images, log(a\*b) = log(a) + log(b). It's a way of seeing that multiplication on (0, infinity) and addition on (-infinity, infinity) are essentially equivalent.

&gt;(mixing one's labour with unclaimed resources is the basis of ownership).  In what way does this bring you to a theory that denounces property rights? I could see agorism, but socialism?   Plus, this is the basis for ORIGINAL ownership, not ownership in general. If this were the basis for ALL ownership, trade wouldn't be ethical.

I'm with you on this one. I wouldn't put it as harsh words as you did, but this kind of thing really does seem childish. This is like believing in Santa Claus. The idea is nice, I would appreciate if someone got me one of these because I know they want me to be safe, but I wouldn't actually put it on my bike, that's just retarded.  I'm also surprised so many people actually believe in this kind of thing.

Here's a reason why I'm no longer friends with someone: He was telling me all about how he was in this game and some Varus started sucking and didn't have as much farm as a Vayne on the enemy team...

"NO I DIDN'T BLEEP BLEEP BLEEPITY YOU BLEEPING HYPOCRITE BLEEP BLEEP"  ...

Damn I love this question. Here's what I think:  * Church Fathers and earlier heresies (i.e. Gnosticism, Marcionism, Arianism etc...). Also including arguments Church Fathers held for the true Christianity. And it'd be awesome if there was St. Nicholas laying the smack down on Arius.   * Persecutions of Christians  * Constantine's conversion and legalization of Christianity  * Ecumenical Councils   * Charlemagne (and some his ancestors such as Pepin the short)  * Justinian's Hagia Sophia and how he said something along the lines of "Solomon I have surpassed you"  * Islam and Christian-Islamic Tension  * Great Schism of 1054  * Crusades  * Inquisition  * Great Western Schism (Anti-Popes and the true popes) and the Council of Constance  * The "Renaissance popes" that weren't known for being too great...  * Martin Luther (views on him would differ since Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants would disagree)  * King Henry VIII and the rise of the Church of England  * Council of Trent (if it was a Catholic Bible)  * Napoleon  * Nazism, Fascism, Communism and the Christian response  * Maybe some Gandhi  * Vatican Council I and II  * Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandal   * Also some false teachers like Harold Camping  * Stuff about atheists over the years (Voltaire to the "new" atheists such as Hitchens, Harris, Dawkins)   * Homosexuality and Abortion (Roe V. Wade)  That's all I can think of off the top of my head, but there's probably a lot more interesting historical events. 
I agree it's setting the bar high, but with the teams we play next year I think we have a good shot at playoffs.

It never ceases to amaze me how insufficient an understanding the general public has about supply and demand. Almost everything in your life, no matter where you live, is governed by this economic principle. I can count on one hand the number of times I even heard this concept mentioned in my grade school education before I went to college as an economics major. The fact that Shakespeare was held in higher regard than economics in my high school education is something I will never understand. It's no wonder why people have such uninformed, inaccurate assessments of the economy. At least not to me.

It certainly hasn't been confirmed but there is one last multiplayer DLC pack coming mid January so if they do this, i'd think it would be mid February at the earliest.  Since they have done it in the past, I think it's almost guaranteed they will this time but no idea when.

You didn't ask me, but I'll answer anyway. If you ask first, I am more than happy to let you pet my dog- especially if you say how cute he is. I LOVE when people fawn over my dog because I want everyone to think he's as great as I do. However, if I correct him on something and you say, "Oh that's okay!" and try to let him do it anyway, I will become very annoyed with you. It's not that I'm a domineering jerk, but my dog is very smart and very willful. If he is allowed to break one rule, he will start breaking ALL the rules.

It seems to me they look at it basically like Blizzard looks at the UI for WoW. Blizzard's stance is that their main goal with the basic UI is to give you the information you absolutely have to have to allow you to play the game. If you want to be in a top raiding guild or highly ranked in pvp you're going to need the extra utility that mods give. Its not really unfair to use mods since they're freely available. Wargaming is even taking it one step further since they're working on providing an official WoT site to get mods from.

Or some of us delay marriage because it actually means something to us, while not being what we would consider the definition of "success", and use our earlier relationship experiences to form what our idea of a life partner is and hone our own inter-relationship skills.  As a woman who married for the first time at 38, this shit really pisses me off. If my husband and I had meet 15 years ago, we would not be together. I would not have had the skills or experience to be a good partner to him. I am completely self-sufficient. I don't "need"my husband for my quality of life or to maintain my standard of living. He's my husband because I WANT him in my life. Fuck this kind of thinking.

mistyped the number. Hello JR
LOL, you have no idea what Islam is do you.  You should take the time to learn about other cultures and religions before commenting on them.  The same text that says jews and christians should not eat pork also is followed by muslims.   Muhammad was an arab at a time when the arab pennisula was full of many tribes some who followed no religion, some were christians, some followed judaism, and some followed other religions.    Muhammad was born into the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe.   The Quraysh tribe was a group of people who were merchants.  The Quaraysh's main god was Hubal. There were other pagan gods and the tribe had idols for Hbual and the other gods at Kaaba (AKA mecca).   Muhammad was a salesman/merchant his entire life.   Muhammad once met a man who was a christian that told Muhammad that he was a profit according to the bible and that is what essentially started the idea of Islam.   Muhammad was raised with the knowledge of many different religions.   Many years later at the age of 40, Muhammad then built off the old testament of the bible and said he was a prophet as described in the bible which was an idea first given to him by a christian.    Thus why muslims do not eat pork is the same reasons that jews and christians cant eat pork, the old testament says pigs are unclean animals that spread disease.  Although christians choose not to follow the old testament requirement of not eating pork just as any other religious person can do.    ...~~~===*   The more you know.  Islam was started around 650 AD, but as I have shown you it is built off of judaism/christianity so its religious history goes back way farther than 650AD and actually it goes back to the beginning when judaism was invented around 1000 BC.

But they aren't paying any extra money, most locals also go during peak times *and* off peak times.   Food might be profitable but it's no-where near enough to make up for guests not paying for tickets. Remember it only takes 2 or 3 visits to make a pass worthwhile.   Anyway if I've heard correctly a lot of people are trading in their passes for a refund, apparently if you have a pass and aren't allowed in due to capacity limits *and* you kick up a bit of a fuss (ie.

You realize he was the only one treated like that right? Hundreds of other people including me posted in Smite's reddit about their ban and were always neglected. You can go ahead and make your research about it and the most famous one is FAERayo. The reason they gave him an exception is because he is an IT professional who can cause them some serious harm, and because he made people on /r/Games be aware of their horrible detection system and people there admitted how bad of a company Hi-Rez is.

I can't even imagine how we see ourselves as the least arrogant. I wouldn't have us at the top but we blatantly have a relatively high opinion of ourselves. We've made an art of looking down on people because they don't hate themselves enough. We don't think much of ourselves and that is why we are the best. It is a very confused form of arrogance.

The plot of the story involves Bond helping the FBI figure out who is behind a string of data thefts involving stealing government secrets from the U.S. and its allies. The attacks have nearly destroyed the infrastructure and nearly wiped out all bank's digital data, nearly collapsing the U.S. dollar instantly. The attacks are also affecting everyone else to a lesser degree, except China, which has reported no attacks of any kind.  A majority led by the U.S. and surprisingly, Russia, in the U.N. are not buying the Chinese counter-argument, as the Chinese consider themselves as innocent.  Most people in the U.S. and are convinced that the Chinese are behind it, based upon popular U.S. sensationalism, fear-mongering, and xenophobia, while a few believe otherwise. Obama is taking flack from this chaos, and his administration is pressuring him to to expand the NSA's capabilities to "unlimited and unchecked," and U.S. military's presence near China to "invasion-ready." The U.S.' allies are trying to pin this blame on China with the help of Israel. A non-believer, a female IT security specialist for the U.S. Navy, is working alongside bond to help figure this out.  A trip to Israel leads Bond and this specialist to the suspected attack's source location to a villa here. They get involved with a high-ranking corrupt government official from the Israeli government there. He is found out to be apart of the attacks, and is also gaining much from pocketing U.S. foreign aid for himself and selling U.S. supplied arms and technology to well-known terrorist groups in the region. It is revealed that he also apart of a secret plot to destabilize the Saudi kingdom as well.  Bond kills him, but now has to outrun Israeli special forces. Their efforts are made worse, as a tall-Jaws-like individual who has half of his body replaced with cybernetic parts, is piloting an attack helicopter, and is pursuing them. Boris, the disfigured-faced being is piloting an attack helicopter, and wants them dead! He is stopped when the pair leads him to his demise after being chased and lead to a crash during a canyon chase. From their efforts there, they gain a lead to the Chinese mainland to a laid-off, advanced in age, network security specialist who lives in an a small house outside the  outskirts of Beijing. He mentions to Bond about is monitoring of the attacks in real-time in his spare time. He shows them a map of the past and concurrent attacks, suspecting that were not from China, but all suspiciously originating from an unknown location in Russia.  Bond is informed by MI6 to meet with a contact in Moscow about the source of the actual attacks. Going to the location supplied, they wait in an abandoned warehouse, where they meet their contact, who reveals themselves as Edward Snowden. Snowden tells them that China is being framed, and that Russia is at fault. He also reveals information about Chinese banks being nearly cleaned out, and their military suffering similar cyber attacks experienced by the U.S.' military as well. He also reveals that part of his NSA leaks showed that the NSA was also involved in a recent cyber war against an outside "entity" described as "equally capable as theirs." Not only that, there are also many traitors inside the organization who are working against the U.S. for "extremely generous" amounts of money from this "entity," with the list showing the current director receiving as much as a billion US dollars.   Their meeting is ended by pursuing Russian special forces, with a burnt, angry Boris leading the group. Boris is seen blowing up the door, using a rocket fired from a ridiculously over-sized assault rifle, leading the assault. In the scramble, the Navy IT specialist is captured, Snowden is killed in action, but Bond manages to get away. He feels something weird in his coat pocket, and discovers a thumb drive that Snowden must have slipped to him unknowingly.  His search takes him to Putin's office in the Kremlin. He is caught during an infiltration attempt. Putin turns around in his chair, while sipping a cup of tea and smiles as bullet-resistant wall comes down and separates his desk and Bond. Boris comes out from a secret wall panel, and faces Bond as Putin's entertainment. Putin escapes during this time. Bond uses his wits to defeat Boris, and finds an escape route through Boris' secret panel.  Bond finds Putin's actual hideout later, a highly secure underground state-of-the-art server warehouse, thanks to an earlier information tip received from Snowden. Bond sneaks in successfully, but finds out that the Navy IT specialist is being forced at gun-point to hack the NSA for control of the U.S.' surveillance capabilities. Putin is also heard speaking of China as "his personal flak scapegoat for the American's anger towards Russian interests". He encourages a group of hackers before him as they toil away as something unknown. He also mentions something else about, "Russia influencing the world with American charm, but with American capabilities at his disposal." Bond neutralizes nearby security, including the guard holding the Naval IT specialist at gunpoint, and confronts Putin, with him revealing the plot, "To control the eyes of the world, the minds of their bodies, and wealth of their currencies.."  In the news, China is facing internal mass panic and government protests, and another series of cyber attacks have happening worldwide...  Outside China's oceanic borders, "warning" skirmishes have increased between U.S. and Chinese air and naval forces. Reports of rumored casualties on both sides and the idea of the U.S. "wiping China off the map" under worldwide sensationalism, hits the news... Bond has to chase Putin throughout this facility, and into a server room with a monitor in a center. On the monitor is a map of the world, with paths tracing from the facility to every country all over the world. A bloody fist fight goes on between the two, but Bond defeats Putin. He manages to copy some information from a nearby computer, but Putin survives for a bit to activates the 30-minute self-destruct sequence.  Bond and the IT specialist escape the slowly exploding facility in a Russian MiG parked nearby and head towards the nearby U.S. naval group outside China. They are targeted and fired upon, but escape through ejection. Landing on a battleship, the U.S. Naval IT specialist shows her credentials, and reveals Bond's information to everyone. The plot is broadcast around the world for all to see.  In the end, life goes back to normal, and everyone maintains life as before.  The IT specialist and Bond are seen vacationing in Hawaii.

And has repeatedly expressed his remorse, plead guilty and went to gaol, and undergone voluntary programs/made donations etc. Like Vick, people learn, people change, people move on. Don't hold people's pasts against them unless they refuse to change.
Belichicks coming home... In my dreams
I doubt horizon sequel will come next year. I'd say go ahead. It's a fantastic game. 
An incredible amount of personal information down to the last 4 of a credit card and amazon access account.
&gt;you need to acknowledge the idiocy in the fact that Vermont has the same number of Senators as California.  I'm a Vermonter.  I don't hafta acknowledge any such durn-fool thing.  ;)
Because Kennedy didn't technically kill the girl. Laura Bush killed that guy.  And since you enjoy critiquing the appearance of first ladies, why not mention that Laura Bush is pretty chunky and also kind of a creepy Stepford wife?  I don't really give a shit either way. It was just funny to me that /u/tomdarch accurately pointed out that MO was insanely successful and for some reason that was why you hate Democrats.
There's not really an API for it.. it's pretty easy to get them though..

If you need the appid's for a user you can request   http://steamcommunity.com/id/&lt;community_id&gt;/games?tab=all&amp;xml=1  or   http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/&lt;steam_id_64&gt;/games?tab=all&amp;xml=1  Just parse out all the ```&lt;game&gt;``` elements in the ```&lt;games&gt;``` container. Then read the ```&lt;appID&gt;``` element. There's one more image available doing it this way in the ```&lt;logo&gt;``` element.

TO PUT SOME MUSCLE ON MAH FRAME!!!
I'll make a video now.
Oh, yeah, lord knows the Saints had some pitiful players during most of those years, at least on offense. We had a brutal defense, though. Ah, what could the Saints have been with a halfway-competent offense to go along with the Dome Patrol?   Don't think I've forgotten the misery of sharing the division with the "Greatest Show on Turf"-era Rams, either. The 'Niners may have caused most of my anguish, but y'all did your fair share of psychological scarring too. I've always had a healthy fear of the Rams when they meet the Saints -- and as this season proved, that fear is justified!
I prefer thing. Thanks.
You can add me, if you don't mind me being from Poland :) GT: Stripedew.  I play GTA V, Black Ops 2, L4D2, Halo (not 4 though, sadly), Trials and a few others

I prefer the finger method. You get to see exactly how much cream you are taking. And you won't transfer anything unnecessary into the tub. 
Add me pleeeease bro :D

Stuart was hilarious!
This is mainly because the donations dont get utilized properly. In many cases countries receiving these donations do not have proper systems to ensure that the money reaches where it is needed.   Also, many third world countries lack in skill and training to turn donation money into investments which payback later.
