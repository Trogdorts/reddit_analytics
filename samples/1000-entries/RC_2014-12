I think that the regulations about use of force make police aware that they are more likely to go home safe and sound if they kill a suspect, as long as they can honestly report they felt under threat (despite the police officer being capable of avoiding that dangerous situation, which I bet they would exercise if they didn't feel they had a license to kill.  How is it that German police, with sidearms, are so good at not shooting innocent people? or at missing their shots?  I think it's because they are accountable for stray bullets, and culpable for homicide if they kill an innocent. In america, mistakes err to the side of "well, the officer didn't do it with malicious intent, so they will go home without charges, or a pay reduction"
Yeah I noticed this recently. You are not alone.

I hope he comes back healthy, but the Cardinals take it easy on him for 3 weeks before the real NFL playoffs, suckering my fantasy playoff opponent into starting him while Stepfan Taylor and Michael Bush vulture all his touchdowns and he only gets 13 carries.

Even with nicotine's half life of 2-3 hours, the way I burn through juice if I was getting 100% BA  it would leave me dead given nicotine's LD50.  Good guidelines given you just have to throw a BA (bio-availability) multiplier on it if you want a better estimate...or a multiplier for nic level.  People getting their panties in a bunch just need to calm down and take it for what it's worth.  Edit:  Someone should really just make a sensitivity matrix with nic absorption rate and nic level on the axes or something.

One thing you could look into is biopharmaceuticals, using proteins/enzymes/antibodies as drugs (vaccines are also included in this field, but those are ancient by comparison). I'm in a program for that now (that focuses a lot more on the industrial/manufacturing side) and it's a super interesting field that's already pretty profitable, but is expected to absolutely explode soon just because of the advancement of related technology recently.

I am not sure what you mean, do you mean your monitor is 720p. That image is 1920p and fixed. That means when you zoom out or look at it with a different res monitor it will zoom in and out to fit the needs, it won't stay the same size. So what your saying is you want the size to be responsive, and stay the same size on all displays?

&gt;  no test produces raw scores directly on the scale's coordinates  This is false.  The vast majority of psychometric scales have not gone through the extensive validation and norming of an IQ test where raw counts of items correct or points earned across items are then normed by age or gender or whatever and then cross-walked to a standard score ala a "transformation table" (which if you understood my last post you would realize I have a deep understanding of -- when I drew the distinction between a raw score and a standardized score I was envisioning the transformation table....doh). I could name dozens of scales that I have used in my own research, or where I have consulted on a project where that scale was used, where the raw score is all you have, where at most perhaps the raw score is compared to a "scale" with cut-off values that indicate, for example, no depression, mild depression, moderate depression, or severe depression.  Here, look at the BDI, it is so obvious an example that proves the point and shows, once again, that you are drawing broad generalizations about things you have not mastered.  http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/NMCP2/PatientServices/SleepClinicLab/Documents/Beck_Depression_Inventory.pdf  How can you look at that and tell me "no test produces raw scores directly on the scale's coordinates"?  It is so direct and easy that Beck declared a lay person who has never seen the BDI before can do it themselves. To be clear on this point, what you did here is you made a broad statement without stopping to consider that there are plenty of scales and tests that are criterion based, not normed.  And then you think I am wording things poorly.  Laughing to myself here, do undergrads really behave like this these days?  &gt; you don't understand the theory behind norm-reference testing   This is also false.  Laughably false.  And no, I don't know how or why Lewis Terman landed on a SD = 16 but he got there before Weschler developed the WAIS, and so Weschler adopted SB's mean of 100 but set his SD one unit smaller knowing that would be a distinguishing characteristic -- just large enough to to be noticable in the literature, but not so large as to make it difficult to compare a Weschler IQ of 120 to a SB IQ of 121.  And with a mean of 100 and SD = 15 it is easier to do the quick mental math and know that an IQ of 90 is about 2/3rds of a SD below the mean and picture where that is on the normal curve with your mind's eye.  The mental math is not so easy when SD = 16, so Weschler either made a wise choice, or just adopted SD = 15 and got lucky that his standard has a wee advantage when it comes to simplicity of interpretation (on top of the huge advantage the Weschler tests have with regard to simpler materials, easier administration, faster set-up, faster scoring, and all that being true when you learn the WMS, thus making the Weschler franchise much more successful with regard to broad adoption).  And lo and behold when I check the SB and WAIS descriptions on wikipedia, I see that my mentor's major advisor, Bob Thorndike, was lead author on the 1986 revision of the SB.  But by then nobody was using SB in mainstream clinical work which explains why I did not know that -- likely we used the prior 3rd edition kits because I only administered one SB in my entire career.  &gt; Do you know why an IQ has a mean of a 100 and SD 15 and not 10, 20 or 40?  I know it is a trivial question because M = 100 and SD = 15 is a completely arbitrary convention.  There is nothing magical or special about those numbers, they are used because Terman and then Weschler set a precedence, not because SD = 10 or SD = 20 would not have worked.  &gt;  your original example was poorly worded  Exactly what was unclear and thus caused you to immediately become confused and start saying that all samples have a mean IQ = 100?  I think the issue here is not poor wording on my part, but you jumping the gun and thinking you could school me without checking your own use of vocabulary.  &gt; I recognize though that you're a tests user not a tests builder  This is a perceptual error on your part.  Again, laughable, but there it is -- I've probably forgotten more about scale development, having consulted on so many different studies across so many different domains, than you will ever be exposed to.  &gt; this might be why our perspective regarding the mathematics of psychological testing is different  You've not said anything about your perspective that merits discussion, other than when you make broad generalizations that are easy to disprove, or get confused when someone describes a thought experiment of drawing a sample and you go down a rabbit hole on a meaningless "norming" exercise.  Two final items to leave you with....  http://i.imgur.com/nytQBj1.jpg &lt;-- this is what I was doing back around 1990.  Pulled that out of the vault a few months ago when doing a guest lecture.  So yea, you're probably right, I don't understand much about any of this whole scales and norming and psychological measurement stuff...  http://imgur.com/EvHKS5h  &lt;-- from a few weeks ago, mentoring a high school senior on practical application of measurement theory in the domain of healthcare economics.   Yea, you are so right, I'm completely out of my wheel house...
They're hardly being an ass, it seems like a completely legitimate question to anyone who isn't intimately familiar with the game's workings.
Yeah, the arguments presented are very poor. Both groups have equal chance of staying in their starting quintiles... That's a terrible measurement, especially in this case where that chance is lower than uniform random would be.  Imagine if the data showed that rich dropouts were 98% likely to end up in the 4th (2nd lowest) quintile and 1% to stay in the top, 1% fall to the bottom, while poor college grads are 99% top, 1% bottom.  Then literally the exact same analysis would apply.

I'm not sure you can compare legislation to evolution, at all.   It's not like we just make up random laws, implement all of them, and only keep what works. People must thoughtfully draft policy and get it approved. Laws tend to go into effect because someone thought they *should.* "Should" itself is a very strongly moral word.

True, but given OP's current situation there isn't an ideal solution.  There may be "better" options, rather than the GPU oriented one I found on first search. If it's a motherboard that support bifurcation, you could go with something like:  http://www.mypccase.com/pcduricawfls.html  PCIe Dual-Lanes Riser Card w/ Flexible Splitter from 1 x PCIe x16 to 2-slots PCIe x8 (In 2 x16 slots).

Is any of the huge software valuations worth as much as people pay for them? I doubt it. $100MM is basically nothing to some of these companies though. I've heard that you can value a tech company at $20 per user which seems incredibly inflated, IMO. My friend and I joke about this phenomenon so much that we now refer to a billion dollars as an "Instagram". The company had literally ZERO revenue and facebook dumped that amount of cash for them. It is mind boggling. I don't get it. I just hope I have an app get a few million users so I can sell out and retire before I'm 30. It's the new American dream.

First things first - as I'm sure you're aware, TRP is utter filth and is poisonous to anything resembling healthy relationships. Real love is about trust, communication, respect, and chemistry, not emotional manipulation. Stop reading it immediately.  As a guy in my mid-to-late 20s, I've dated both younger and older women, up to 7 years my senior. In all honesty, I've never felt like the younger ones were particularly more attractive. On a mental level, if anything the capacity for attraction dramatically increases with age, as you gain a better understanding of human interaction and get better at reading subtle cues. You mentioned you're different looking; I can see how that would be a difficult hurdle but not impossible to deal with, especially considering you've had relationships before. It might mean you have to think outside the typical dating box to find the right person for you, but believe me, there are plenty of decent guys in a similar position to yours. It may take some brave decisions to put yourself out there and make a move when you meet someone you like.   I sometimes feel the same way you do, that "all the good women are already taken". Of course there is a grain of truth to this, as more people tend to enter stable relationships as time goes on. But experience has shown that this isn't as overwhelming as you might think, and I know plenty of single people, male and female, aged 30 and up who are wonderful and deserving of a great partner. It does get harder to find people, but don't give up.

They do go off in different directions sometime. There can also be bound states of a particle and its anti-particle, like positronium, but it's unstable.  One way to think of it is that a particle represents +1 of something, and an antiparticle -1 of something, and when they get together you have zero.

&gt;and after she had done her business her husband pushed her over on the side and removed the diaper and cleaned her.  Am I a horrible, selfish person for thinking there's just no way I'd stick around for that? I mean, is this guy crazy or is he just a way better person than I am?

I listened to a great interview with the author on The Geek's Guide to the Galaxy podcast. He really sold me on the series, particularly the 2nd book. I've only read the first so far and I'm not sure how i feel about it, but I think i liked it enough to continue the series.

Dolly is back in the Wonder Cave in Superior Town, it's behind a boulder you have to push with Strength (did you just forget those existed after you beat/caught unown?).  Machete is in Agassiz town, follow a path to the right of the Secret Base that opened after you beat Jonathan.  Instant Lapras is in a building in Ladoga town... talk to people.  And yes, Zeus/Odin is a pretty big difficulty jump for most people.

It's the truth. Simply because it was watered down once from extreme contracts, doesn't mean it won't need to happen again. TVXQ's ruling simply made the contracts humane, they still have room to be abusive like this situation. It obviously needs to be seen to again.

Everyone has a different opinion about that stuff, you'll definitely get mixed reviews. Personally, I absolutely hate 25i. It has a brain-hurting hangover, and I don't find the circular thought loops any fun. The visual are too intense, and I just feel flat out dumb on it. Everytime I've done 25i, the best part for me was waiting for the trip to be over already. And this is coming from a guy who loves psychedelics and all kinds of drugs, but not that stuff. Yuck.
For the first part, well, when the first car manufacturer in Britain developed a car that we were like 'ay this is pretty good, the wheel's in a good place and all the pedals make sense, let's stick with this from now on, eh?' We sortof gave up on changing the format and everyone went a long with it. As such we built our whole road network around it, unfortunately we found out the other two big developers of cars (Germany and 'Murica) had done exactly the same thing, but mirrored, to which we said BOLLOCKS and just kept with what we had since it was too late to change everything.  Second, we don't tax that heavily on the big stuff like heating or electricity or income and healthcare is free. However, to make up for the fact that we don't slit your throat with bills, we have this annoying thing called VAT. As such whenever you buy anything, you're being taxed. Everything bought in this country has a 17.5% price increase because otherwise the icecaps would melt or baby seals would explode.  Public transport in this country is infact shit, one time a swiss man came to Britain and died from stress waiting on a connection between Manchester and Birmingham because he had never seen a train be over an hour late, True story. Sometimes a bus will come,. sometimes it won't, sometimes two will show up and other times it will just drive straight past without stopping. Honestly you'd get where you are going faster is you crawled along the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic.  The Monarchy, we need them because without them our stamps and currency wouldn't have pictures of people on them that we can universally agree are the proverbial 'wankers'.

I don't know, but I think he means that it's amazing to see a warning like that.  Here in the states the attitude usually is "dopers deserve to die" and would never warn us like that if they knew there was white heroin being sold as coke, they wouldn't warn anybody.  They would probably sit back and laugh as the death toll rises.

It's psychosomatic response to knowing she doesn't want you. It makes you feel like you're using her as a sex object and it makes you feel negative emotions like guilt, so you stop wanting to have sex as much in that moment and have trouble maintaining an erection due to those feelings.

British girls on the whole can't dance, I work as a nightclub photographer and trust me in 2 years I've seen 3 competent dancers, all of whom wore flats.  British girls go out wearing high heels and lots of skin and makeup like a drag queen cause clubs are dark and that level of makeup is fairly appropriate for it.  Also everyone drinks before they leave the house so they will probably have a vodka coat on and not feel the cold.

Some of the responses in here are pretty accurate but are subject to some misconceptions in regards to creatine. Does it increase water rention? Yes. Does it directly increase muscle mass or strength? No. The top post explaining creatine monohydrate and its role in enhancing physiologicsl energy systems is accurate, but a little more information is needed.   Cr will incease ATP availability in the creatine phopshate energy system. This system supplies energy for the first 10~12 seconds of activity. So, how exactly does Cr supplementatiom affect this? Essentially it results in an extention of the total duration of that energy pathway-- from 10s to 15s perhaps. For your power athletes and sprinters, this is huge. For general strength gains, not so much.   What it DOES mean for general strength training. Your normal 10 rep max may become a 12 rep max due to greater availability of energy equating to an extra rep or two. This is where the strength gains come from. Improvement in strength is a function of time under tension and this increase in #reps performed increases time under tension increases strengtj and\or mass gains over time.  Thats it in a nutshell, to supplement the top post.   Some additional information, Cr has also been reported to increase strength of connective tissues which is also of potential use as you increase strength and put your tendons and ligaments under greater strains.  As to the amount and timing, id have to go back and reference articles from a sports nutrition class, but a loading phase of app. 17g/d for 5 days is essential before beginning your 5g/d maintenance phase. The above value is approximate, total value for loading is dependent on body mass. Id have to look it up.  Sorry for any errors in typing my post. On my phone.

You might be right about Tibetan doctrine regarding the skandhas, but my concern is a correct understanding of the Dhamma (related to the khandhas) taught by the Buddha as preserved in the Pali Canon.

I was playing a multiplayer game with a friend, and our colonial nations brought as at war every 20 years or so. Colonial nations are, in fact, retarded and shouldn't be allowed to war with each other without the overlord approving it. It got to the point where I just stopped the game briefly and consoled us to be at peace again it happened so often and were so tired of fighting against Iberia.

Even though it's sort of crazy to me, I can manage to rationalize crazy expensive fashion.  Hey, if that's really important to you, more power to ya--we have different priorities.  And obscenely expensive clothing *does* ostensibly have better craftsmanship, so there's at least a small practical benefit.  But $1200 baby blankets?  Your baby doesn't know or care that the blanket is $1200.  It's just you, and whoever you show it off to.   Servants, I can understand.  Mansions, I can understand.  Yachts, I can understand.  $1200 baby blankets...that's just obscene.  There is genuinely no purpose to it other than the pricetag itself.  Bleh.

AMD doesn't really give you much of an advantage. Their aging architecture has really weak per-core performance, which is what still really matters in gaming.  Plus the fact this is already the last processor you will probably ever buy for AM3+. Which means even more money when that time comes, which will be sooner rather than later.  Even a Core i3 at this point is a better investment. Much stronger per core, and much easier to upgrade down the road.

&gt; Yeast harvesting is tough to reduce to first principle. There are many different species of wild yeast, so a bit of lab work would be needed to find the right one to cultivate.  They have made beer with yeast that lives naturally in vaginas, it can't be that hard. People make beer by opening the window and letting it spontaneously ferment. People make wine by mashing some grapes with their feet. Yeast is EASY.

Here is the relevant text from the Wikipedia article:   &gt; [[File:Forest Lawn2010.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait and other tributes, including mural and messages from 650 Spanish fans, letters, pictures, teddy bears, and flowers.|Tribute of fans from all over the world in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park on the first anniversary of his death]] On June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Jackson's death, fans traveled to Los Angeles to pay their tribute to him. They visited Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and his family's home, as well as Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Many of the fans were carrying sunflowers and other tribute items to drop off at the sites. Members of the Jackson family and close friends arrived to pay their respects. Katherine returned to Gary, Indiana to unveil a granite monument constructed in the front yard of the family home. The memorial continued with a candlelight vigil and a special performance of "We Are the World". On June 26, there was a protest march in front of the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division at the old Parker Center building and a petition with thousands of signatures demanding justice was delivered. The Jackson Family Foundation in conjunction with Voiceplate presented "Forever Michael", an event bringing together Jackson family members, celebrities, fans, supporters and the community to celebrate and honor his legacy. A portion of the proceeds were presented to some of Jackson's favorite charities. Katherine also introduced her new book "Never Can Say Goodbye".

Can you find comparable places charging less than the increase? I would point out to her that places charging 1150 have certain features or in a condition that your apartment is. My SO was great about haggling down our proposed rent increase because we found a comparable place for less than the increase. Also, use her desire to have good tenants against her. Remind her you're a great tenant and would hate to have her rent to someone who she doesn't know if they would make the rent and treat the place with care!

What or who is to blame, in your perspective? Or, what do MRAs tend to think? I've never looked into the reasons really, all I know is I agree it's bad for all kids for trying successfully to fit children into narrow molds that restrict their development.
Alright, so most of this is just recapping what labor and work is and what the defines labor and work.  I know most of this and agree with you about the difference between work and labor in a capitalist versus an anarchist society, so I won't deal with that.  &gt; The obligation to work comes from the need to produce goods in order to survive. You can either work two hours a week and reap the benefits of the collective effort of your entire community or you can go it alone - spending far more time labouring than not - for a fraction of the reward. If you do not want to work at all, then go ahead, hopefully the community would be willing to accommodate you. It is their decision at the end of the day.  &gt;Labour is a necessary aspect of human survival, we cannot live unless we exert energy to produce the things we need. It should be the social responsibility of every individual to take part in the creation of the collective wealth of their community not out of some moral obligation but because the alternative requires much more energy for a much smaller reward. There is a reason humans came together into tribes in the first place.  This, I can deal with.  First, I am not obliged to work for survival.  I can do no work and provide old useful objects and material for trade.  Or, I could provide a service that makes use of no labor.  I.e., I could write you a poem, unless we are going to define everything that requires effort as work. Or, I could have the needs I have for survival met by the good graces of others. I don't need to produce my own products for my survival, so how am I obliged to work for these?  It must be something else that obliges me.  I am aware of Kropotkin's labor ideas.  I don't think you even use your internal logic of what labor is.  Why all this emphasis on rewards for labor?  Isn't being reimbursed for labor a capitalist wage system? I also don't see why the community is more important than me.  Why are the needs of the community more than my needs?  What impels me to help them, my survival?  Doesn't that mean that the community acts like a dictator over my existence, stifling my freedom?  If the community does not provide for me, then I would naturally not provide for them.  I agree, but what coheres the community to me?  If I only need to work two hours, I am not important and my work isn't valuable, so therefore if we are bound to communities through work, I'm rather useless/there is no reason for the community to uphold any obligation to me, as they can simply find other people.  Then, does that mean that I'm bonded to the community through social relations, if it isn't via work, as my work is more than worthless?  Personally, I'm a very unpleasant person and can't see myself surviving in an Anarchist society if it's ALL based on social relations.  Labor is not necessary for human's survival.  The good will and understanding of others is necessary.  Once again, where does the social responsibility to work for a community come from?  If there is no obligation to feed me when I don't work, or provide for me just because it's right, I have no obligation to the community as they have simply said that my right to exist is not inherent in my humanity and is dependant on what I can do for others for a reward.  That is essentially capitalism.

It's almost as if you're expecting a negative reaction...
In a card game though, playing with RNG is about playing around each possibility. You have distinct outcomes based on an RNG event and the skill comes from ensuring you have a play that gives you the upper hand in as many of those outcomes as possible. That's different than weapon inaccuracy just for the sake of nerfing the weapon, which, while sometimes necessary, decreases the skill ceiling.

I would prefer a cloaky nullified T3 with a mobile depot. Have a travel fit, a gank fit, and a hacking fit. Restricts you from entering frigate/dessy wormholes, but so does a Stratios. Cloaky nullified is easy mode for navigating null/wh bubbles, and in general being slippery.  Only issue is T3s are a bit SP intensive and expensive, if you are new. Until then, I'd use an Astero or a covops. Prefer an Astero, so you can gank other explorers and steal their loot.

The Silver Bullets and other teams like them were not top level professional teams. Tri-Cities was the starting point of an NBA franchise.

Gotcha.
I can imagine the rich funding the trips of desperate people in exchange for prestige. I'm not sure how that would turn out. I'm sure there are some scientists who would be willing to give their life to be able to do continuous research in such a strange environment, and plenty of governments willing to give money to have their own citizens (coerced or not) on another world. I do wonder about how easy it would be to get thousands of viable and self funded volunteers, especially if there are too many early tragedies. But it is theoretically possible to make a rather comfortable place on mars with sufficient experience. And those volunteers needn't be self funded, as professional yacht racing has shown.

I do think they are both alive.   I base on this on the fact that typical visual media have choke = instant death whereas AZ was somewhat more medically accurate with her only passing out/heart stop. Neither took a 100% lethal hit[^*](/s 'Yes you can survive being shot in the eye').  I do however expect people losing their mind and call it bullshit cop out if they survive.

It's not all you're saying, because you're trying to claim that that anecdotal, secondhand information should be considered a legitimate source when examining whether or not "a lot of people react negatively to it," which is simply not acceptable. However, in a forum devoted to skincare where there was a survey done about one specific product to see if "a lot of people" have bad reactions to it, and that survey returns the information that 1/4 of the product's users reacted negatively, that's not "a lot." If one person out of a group of 4 has a negative reaction to something, that's not statistically relevant. If 100 out of 400 people have a negative reaction to a product, then we're getting somewhere.  Dermatologists recommend CeraVe all the time. This isn't an issue of listening to "random people on the internet" (of which you are one, to the rest of us).

Lol same top comment as the original post yesterday.
lol those appeals to authority.   Do you want a double blind long term human study done on wi-fi? How about new episodes of the simpsons?   We don't need them because there's no theoretical method of harm?   Strange. That's why we don't need them on GM crops.   People who are anti-gm get called anti-science because by and large you people don't understand the science. You trumpet shoddy, poorly done studies until the cows come home while claiming every other study is corrupt. You like to grasp at random scientific terms and ideas without having any idea of their relevance or purpose.   If anyone it's doing mental gymnastics it's you guys, trying to constantly fight against science just to cling to the idea that natural is somehow better (don't forget to keep eating that delicious organic crop created by bathing the seeds in radiation though, yumyum).  First there weren't enough studies. Then there weren't long enough studies (thanks to seralini thousands of keyboard warriors suddenly knew more about toxicological studies than the medical and scientific establishment), now it's no long term human studies. Shifting goal post after shifting goalpost, desperate to hang on to the notion that us altering our food with a more accurate method than we've been using to alter it for all of recorded history is somehow making it worse.   I'm used to whack job conspiracy posts on the internet, so I guess the only thing that surprises me about the whole anti-gm thing is that none of its advocates seem to twig that this whole movement is funded by people who profit directly from the paranoia it causes. One of the organic supermarkets who funded the Seralini study even had a massive 'gm-free' campaign that hit at the same time the study was released ffs.   But no, no, it's everyone else who is corrupt. Even if no one can find anything wrong with any of their studies (asides from where the money came from).   Big oil needs to get some hints from the biotech peeps, they can't seem to get science on their side and they are orders of magnitude wealthier.

Handsome- Objectively attractive. I may or may not be sexually attracted to him, but I recognize that he is conventionally attractive.  Cute- Usually used to describe a guy with an attractive face. If I call a guy cute, I'm attracted to him.  Adorable- Used to describe a guy's personality. I won't call a guy adorable unless I'm also attracted to him physically.   Hot- I'm physically attracted to him based on his appearance, but he also has a sexual way about him that I find attractive. "Hot" is what I call men I am very attracted to.  Sexy- I'm attracted to him, most likely based on a combination of appearance and personality. 
Please tell me what it looked like before you got rid of it. I want to make sure I don't have it please.

If you join Three you can get low prices and 4G included if it works where you'll be in Staffordshire. Then when you go back to Ireland you won't incur any extra charges and can use your minutes/texts/data as you would in England. Otherwise a lot of people will recommend Giffgaff, although they recently put their prices up and lowered the allowances.  Can't really recommend a bank, they're all largely the same with their basic accounts. Pick one based on being near to you if you want a branch or which one has an online interface that you prefer.  But if you do go to NI first to open an account in GBP don't pick Danske Bank, First Trust or Bank of Ireland since they have virtually no/a tiny presence in the rest of the UK.  RBS might not be  the best choice for living in England. Outside Scotland its presence is small, with Natwest more common, and I don't think there's a great deal of customer integration between them.

I've played football and rugby as well.   There are still plenty of hits in rugby, but the point I was trying to make is that the way football sets up hits is not very prevalent in rugby. Ex., you're not going to have an inside center get blindsided by a flanker trying to catch a dig route over the middle.

Others could probably help you more, but based on my experience with pants...   1) Look for straight leg cuts, not skinny, and see if that helps you feel less big in the middle (there won't be that drastic reduction in pant width so there's a bit less contrast).  2) Sizing up won't usually work if the cut of the waist isn't right for you. What makes you think they look frumpy? Are you straighter throughout the waist (aka flatter butt)? If that's the case, look only for pants that are cut that way. Don't even consider a curvy cut even 'just to see' - you'll just get frustrated (I have the opposite issue and trying on straight waisted pants is just a miserable muffin-topped failure).
Hold up, let me just google the definition of "subjectivity" real quick.

Pull the tabs on the bottom of the arms, pull tv off, remount at angle wanted, put tv back up?  Did you mount it yourself? If yes, shouldn't be much different than the first time you did it.  Do you want it to match the ceiling? If yes, just mark the distance down from the top of the wall twice and use a straight edge to mark a line between those 2 marks, and use that as your new guide to mount instead of a level.  You also probably have a bit of play in the mount itself as well, but it's not going to be much and i wouldnt trust sliding one end up, other end down , to hold over time. 
Except now there are no longer any American films, and the US is a pretty important country in the history of film making.

Nothing in this life matters and i dont wanna waste it stressing about my next exam or essays ,i would rather dedicate my life towards something that brings the next step for humanity or something that helps me. Everyone is going one way and i wanna somehow step out. Just havent found that way out yet.

do you realize you confessed to a committing multiple criminal acts? Considering how hard it was to get it off the ground, I don't think he's going to be flattered. Youtube has every episode with the T-day bits as well. There's a home video of a tour of the studio up.

When play won't distract him, nor nursing, teething rings or foods like cucumber. I've mostly given it to him in the evenings, before bed.

"Unnecessary roughness" means the play uses excessive force.  A player staring at a punt is not able to protect himself from such a brutal hit.  All Harris had to do was knock Carroll out of the way.  If he was a receiver then the league would support the call.  The league sometimes confuses me with their mixed messages about player safety.  It was an unnecessary hit.

I like the App Transit for Android or IOS idk about Windows phones.  It is not operated by Cap Metro.  Once you play with it a while it is great as you can zoom and see stops relative to your location on the bus.  Just make sure you are looking at the bus going the correct direction.  General tip, know the first and last bus times of the day.  Using a bicycle or Car2go/B Cycle/Uber or Lyft as a supplement can help a lot as well.

I think that's nearly impossible to judge since we all use our phones vastly differently and many of us lost out on some battery saving KK only stuff via Xposed Modules. There's also some bugs affecting some people and not others. For my personal usage it seems about the same but I'm also using a custom kernel.   Lollipop is supposed to have better battery life in concept but it might take a 5.0.1 update to do so on this particular device.
Dabs would be great, but the only problem is that I have no place to get them. I live in a small town and getting a dime bag of weed is hard as hell. So dabs are sadly out. :(

Esper control has a really hit or miss mana base but performs really well using a variety of removal, counters, and strong win cons like [[Elspeth, Sun's Champion]]. Probably the most expensive control deck cuz of mana base and  Elspeths etc. Azorius and Dimir from what I've seen so far both have very few problems with mana. Dimir has a good early game and an absolute buttload of removal but lacks a strong sweeper (other than [[Perilous Vault]] which isn't that great imo due to the mana/prep required to get it to go off.) Azorius also has a strong early game with access to stuff like [[Devouring Light]], [[Last Breath]], and [[Banishing Light]]. They also have [[End Hostilities]] which is the best sweeper you can get right now, but they lack in the kill-on-demand department. Banishing Light is the only reliable way to get rid of planeswalkers and other troublesome non-creatures without countering them. Azorius has access to both [[Pearl Lake Ancient]] and Elspeth as win conditions. I don't really know much about other control decks.  Overall, according to the tournament results we've seen so far, control isn't doing so great this standard. Decks like Abzan and Mardu midrange can just totally overwhelm decks that can't answer most or all plays they can make. However, I love control more than anything else so I'm determined to make it work. Hopefully you'll find a deck you'd like to build and play and I hope I helped you at least a little.
Not really. People have incredibly selective perceptions. For example, people who believe that their sacred texts are correct because conflicting scientific theories don't have enough evidence supporting them.   Economic goals are, by a large margin, the primary cause of wars. When people experience economic benefits, they will believe whichever cause is most convenient for them to understand.

For some reason my kids are "babe".  Not sure when it started.  I noticed that my youngest son calls his girlfriend "babe" too
When i was in fifth grade I passed a note to a classmate i was good friends with. My friend received it and started to laugh quietly. Somehow the teacher notices, looks at the note and tells us she wants to talk to both our parents before proceeding with the lesson. The note said: "would you be my girlfriend?"... The person i gave it to was a boy.

Out of all that, *that's* what you found to be inaccurate?
I'll repeat what I said last week, and I will probably repeat it *ad infinitum*:  the "Jackbox Party Pack" includes "You Don't Know Jack 2015", "Fibbage XL", and "Drawful". Any of those (particularly the latter two, since they rely more on players and less on the in-game host) would be unbelievable for Let's Plays.
I'm not surprised that your ill-conceived and ill-informed bullshit post is currently sitting at -25. You're out to lunch.  All taxi services in Metro Vancouver are required to abide by the ["Taxi Bill of Rights"](http://www.taxirights.gov.bc.ca/faq.html). This includes a provision that states that it is against regulations to refuse a fare just because of distance travelled. Of course it happens, just like any other crime or breaking-of-rules. Doesn't mean that we should just accept it, and it means that your opinion about how far the driver has to travel, toll-bridges, etc- it's just your dumbass opinion, and doesn't apply to the rules and regulations for taxis in Metro Van.  So, nice of you to see the asshole driver's side of things. Thing is, the asshole driver is obliged by provincial regulation to fucking do his job. Even if that includes driving to Surrey.   To everybody else- all taxicabs have a telephone number on the outside of the cab that you can call if you've experienced a fare refusal. Use it, don't let these shitheads push you around.
What percent of humans die of "natural" causes? I'd like to think that being lost or stolen are the cancers and heat disease of the lighter world.   I think more lighters are used until the end the pens. A stolen lighter is still used.
Breaking his house and electronics over some stupid game... Never understood why you would want to break your own shit no matter how made you get.
I was with a group earlier this week that cheesed the Templar as well. This was the first time I had ever experienced this so I basically just killed adds here and there and stayed near the Relic holder while they did it. I promise you, it took longer to do that than to just beat him legit, at least in my experience. He didn't teleport at all, though, but I still don't know how they did it. I just kept my mouth shut for the most part and soldiered on.
This is exactly what you don't want to hear but whether he's cheating doesn't really matter. He has moved on (at least emotionally, if not physically) and just hasn't had the courage to say it. I'm sorry.
Cause they prooved how bad are they? I mean, they played poorly vs an average challenger team. Ryu got totally outplayed by pepiinero and H0R0 did absolutly nothing.
Yeah, It never even occurred to me that the semtex would stick to it.
I swear you say this 5 times a day but okay lol
actually I saw [this](https://twitter.com/SuperMCGamer/status/538761232556515329) posted  somewhere and I felt like it was a bit of stretch for hype.
Lacy is a fucking tank wtf. I'm just scared watching him run.
I thought the trailer was brilliant for this exact reason.  Random snippets that give very little away.  I think a teaser and a full trailer is enough.
No, they're all pretty awesome! And look how many there were too! Which one did you guys end up wi... oh yeah...

No, but I do agree with /u/ahchava when he/she said  &gt; I'm just going to throw this out there, being that I'm youngish myself (early 20's). If you want to be taken seriously in any community which requires any level of expertise, you should learn to write with good, formal, nearly literary style English, rather than conversational English. If you sound like this in real life or when you have professional contacts (with builders, artisans or suppliers) you will get taken for a ride and your quotes are going to be 2-3 times higher than necessary. You might be smart enough to pull this off, but the rest of us don't know that if this is how you present yourself. Please be excited! Enthusiasm goes a long way in getting things done and motivation to keep this lifestyle going. There are just better ways of showing it.
That's what I'm worried about with all YA. Worst part is that half the time in not aware that's even what I'm reading until after a couple chapters. Then, I'm screwed. I hate unfinished business, so I'll read a book beginning to end, uninterrupted (by other books), and won't give up on one either. Even of I think it's terrible.  Stupid amazing books.

Things are quite simple : you need either friends or a good education. At just about any job(even working at a supermarket with crates or selling stuff) you need to have friends. There are 10 people for 1 job and qualifications are not so important ( the person who gets the job will generally do a lot to keep it, ignoring abuse). Having friend will not necessarily get you the job, but it will make it much easier.   If you have an education or a trade, it's good too. If you are lucky you will be considered for a job ( and they will overwork you for a few years, then you can move on if you are lucky).   If you are like me and have no friends nor education, you are basically fucked. I tried getting a job for over 1 year and nothing. I tried everything, car salesmen, car cleaner, newspaper-man(don't know the name),and a about 5 more that I don't know their name in English.    I got work exactly 1 year ago, from 7. november to 7. january at a supermarket, they needed the extra help for holly day and friend got me the job. In the meantime I survived by getting "day work". Basically you have to know a guy that has a job for you, usually "around the house", cutting down trees, or butchering a pig, construction work etc   It's really depressing knowing (when you are in my position) that it's all about blind luck.

Youre right. I apologize to Palestinians. However, why should any American give a rats ass about Isreal after USS Liberty?  As they say, with friends like that, who needs enemies.  Thank God for RT or no one would hear anything from isreal except their lies. 
Probably not. Coming into this game down Pugh... After we lost Geoff Schwartz and James Brewer and had to shift our terrible right guard to Right tackle and put an even worse right guard in for our old right guard... That was it. The Jags finally played a team with a worse offensive line then they had for half a game. And it showed.

Start your 4O1k/ Roth IRA now!  I did at 22.  32 now and I'm pissed off at the growth rate... But i understand that's the challenge.  Don't look at it everyday.  Just wait and every 2 years review your holdings with a professional if needed.  As time passes you will be astounded at the return.
I kinda feel bad because I installed a project Nevada or some other mods and while they made the game deadlier for me, they also made it deadlier for enemies. So eventually I was just blowing up deathclaws left and right with missile launchers and the Fallout "feel" was gone.  Don't know if I have the patience to replay NV again as I know 80% of the early game stuff and can't bother with it anymore :/
Incorrect. You can not jungle in the new jungle without the jungle item &amp; Smite. If you see a pro jungle on Rengar w/o the jungle item check again, he probably just sold it late game to buy a high ticket item.
But thats the thing, you immediately  assume that any man who sleeps with a plethora of women is priased and accepted, when in reality, no one praises them, man-whores are usually total douchebags with few friends,  and when you tell your gf your number and its higher than hers (assuming  shes not a slut too), shes going to call you a pig and make you feel like shit. Im 23, ive slept with 16 women including  my current  gf, and her and my last two gfs before her all made me feel like shit because  i slept with more ppl than they did. No one has ever "congratulated" me, the only other guys ive met who sleep around  a lot are total douche bags who do coke and steal everything they see. Sluts are not just looked down upon because  they sleep around, they are looked down upon because they   have very poor character and they Lie ALL THE TIME.  Sleeping around like a slut is  usually  a symptom of bad character and selfishness. NOT ALWAYS, but usually.  I look down on whores, men and women. Ppl need to stop making excuses for this reckless behavior and indecency. Whores are not dating material. When everyone else has ridden the town bike for free, why should i have to pay/commit for my ride?

It's not that I'm willing to give up the cat rather than the dog... I guess it's that the cat has only ever been aggressive despite my efforts. I see how unfair that is to her. I don't think she could be happy in any other home or even a shelter, she is so fearful of everything. Thru her life the vets had no explanation from of this behavior unfortunately.   I don't expect her to cuddle 24/7, but in general she is just so fearful of everyone and everything, and I have never seen any period of time where she stays non aggressive. I tried to clean her ears and give her treats today, being very gentle, and she bit my hand so hard. I just don't know if I can emotionally handle any longer having this pet who I love who seems completely... I don't know, undomesticated/wild?

Not really, maybe they should make an exception for more harmless drugs but for all those hard drugs that leave your system quick the people who cant control it and get caught anyway are most likely to cause destructive damage to your company. IE get someone killed or maimed like in this picture. It doesnt matter if you work a low end job with no real power to screw anything up, im sure you wouldnt get drug tested for like a car wash or waitress. 
I didn't really do anything to it. I got a pair of good riding pants, Dainese Air Drake, and a 30L and 20L Kriega bags to strap to the seat, since i chopped the tail off. Thats about it. Also new tires and an oil change.

It's fine. People tend to exaggerate the amount of drama things cause. This has caused a bit in the past, but not very much since it's mainly a debate about whether Cole's electrical powers could affect Mercer before he gets gutted by a badass sword, or whether ionic drain would affect Mercer since he doesn't have have a brain or nerves iirc.

herotank sorry for hijacking your thread mate,   let me contribute to the real topic though.  I have it as a wristband, so now and then I get asked by people seeing it like 'oh I've seen that somewhere, and asked myself what it is, can you explain it?' And my TLDR explanation is mostly:   'Well, imagine someone has an eye on you in a negative way, is jealous of you, and wishes you not to succeed or to fail, or something bad. And if you have this Nazar with you, it will usually crack up, if it could prevent it.' Don't know if it's true or not, but that's what I was told.

His post literally said that he "woke the fuck up" when he realized those things do exist. You posted: &gt;Everyone who disagrees with you is just asleep! Your opinions are facts!  The only thing that guy suggested was that they exist, which you got all snarky about. No one was talking about how big of a problem they are (they are still serious problems), just that they're out there. 
I would love to do this
As far as I know, yes.

You probably enjoy Smackdown don't you? Fuckin pleb. 
When he got incredibly angry at me over an issue that I'm positive I wouldn't have reacted over in such a way, verbally berated me, stormed out and ignored me for two weeks and I didn't feel broken. I felt almost relieved that he had given me a valid reason to leave him and seek out my own life. After seven years. It's clearly more complicated than this but what was interesting is that it wasn't a buildup. Just the morning of the fight I woke up and looked at him and thanked my stars he was there and that I got to love him. It all happened at once, but it was an eye opener that gave my friends and even our mutual friends a chance to give some input regarding the fact that they didn't think I should have been putting up with how he treated me for a long time, which I hadn't noticed before. It was a huge eye opening experience.

Sorry, genuine noob here. I'm interested in joining the military, but haven't quite narrowed down a specific branch yet. I'm primarily interested in learning languages or getting some greater linguistic experience and training. I have a 4yr college degree (non linguistic related) with a high enough GPA to qualify for OCS, and have international language and travel experience probably greater then the average recruit.  However, I am unsure how much language work officers receive or if officer work is mainly in management and leading... without the possibility of learning a language. So do you have to be an enlisted man to have greater language learning experience or can officers undergo language training as well?  Additionally how many languages are enlisted/officers allowed to learn through the military? Can you incorporate some self study into the process? Thanks for the help and appreciate the input.

You need to have lots and lots of signings. Everything you'll sell can be found online, and probably for less money. Getting the authors in the store will give the personal touch that is missing from the online shopping experience.   Check out http://www.indiebound.org for professional advice. 
Yeah true just realized I didn't really say why I liked it better than FF. 
This is very good advice! Specify you want a small/intimate wedding, and blame the vendors and your contractual agreements on not being able to include more people ("I'm so sorry, but I couldn't bring more people in now if I wanted to, I'm already locked into a meal plan and seating arrangement for x people that I can't change at this point.") Make sure the uninvited guests feel like you wish they could be there, but circumstances being what they are, it can't happen that way.

True, but if Bama fails to win the SEC CG, that means they are also adding a L. I honestly don't know what the committee would do with a 2 loss non-champion Bama if they are up against 1-loss OSU/TCU/Baylor for the last 2 spots. Especially with OSU and ~~TCU~~ Baylor being conf champs. 1 less loss and a championship should get OSU and ~~TCU~~ Baylor in, but who knows.

And former NFL players often say the same thing. I was part of a program that partnered with the NFLPA and we did two-day neurological assessments on former players. I'd say a majority of them told me they wouldn't let their kids play. One guy told me the only way his kids would be allowed to play is if he coached them himself in terms of how to tackle, but he acknowledged that still wouldn't stop them from taking dangerous hits from other players. 
Uh, no. Not really.

Then I believe the rule needs to be revised, and the bashing of individuals should not be tolerated, while allowing constructive criticism on an outfit level to be tolerated, as long as it doesn't push it.  I acted on the above premise. If this is not the official ruling, then rather than simply removing me, the communication should have been opened saying I was in the wrong, and remind me of the proper policy.

In the beginning switching weapons is hard because you may not have a lot of resources. As well as some skills are much better for some weapons than others.   That being said you can switch from a blue sharpness S.S to a blue sharpness long sword. You just need to go through all the crafting.  Honestly there isn't a big push to switch weapons unless you want to change it up a little.

Calling GamerGate a hate group is not the same as trying to get it officially labeled as a hate group by the SPLC or another monitoring body.  It's decidedly different.  If you're upset about the coverage, ask yourself why people think you're a hate group.

This does sound very creepy, but I know my parents have kept my baby teeth, along with baby teeth from all 4 of my sister, as a sort of memory (like first loose tooth, first front tooth lost or something like that) Maybe that was the same thing in this case (: but that is scary, also considering the condition of the house and the man at the end!
This happened to me today, kind of. I was bumbed out about halfway into my hour trip home from work when I couldn't listen to my saved playlist on my cell phone. The app kept displaying "Internet Connection Needed" or something like that.  I was not about to use my data..   I currently have the LG G2 if anyone is interested.

It's not just Nikon that does this... for any camera mount the body cap is going to be shaped like the back of a lens (since it's fitting in the same place as the back of a lens would).  So it's not surprising when a rear lens cap fits together with it.

While it is understandable that they would not wish to be included, Mind are great and have helped me out personally in my own troubled past. It would have been nice for me to have been able to return the favour to them in some small way. Still, be sure to donate to them if you can spare it, even though they are no longer a part of the livestreams this year, as mental health is very, very important and the work that they and similar charities do is what helped me to even be here today.

To communicate with him you'd need to PM him or comment, right? Have you deleted your comment? If you went by PM. it still should be in you inbox.
Yes,  But like the chain analogy, each individual electron doesn't move the whole length (that would be a superconductor scenario...another story). You could also look at it like a long line of people waiting to buy a newly released iphone.  Folks start at the of the line, blocks away from the store. As new people enter the line; a **different** person enters the store. The whole line moved, but each person only moved a fraction of the whole line's length.  Now, if you could imagine moving the store to the end of the line and having everyone about-face, the line would reverse direction.  The folks in the middle of the line could possible never make it into the store, *but the line still moves.*  While I'm at it, and for kicks only:  * Hertz=how many times the line reverses directions per second. * Resistance=the inverse of the width of the sidewalk. * Voltage=the inverse of the price of the iphone. * Current=how many folks actually enter the store per unit of time.  P.S. The "neutral" nomenclature will make more "sense" once you take into account that there are actually two "different" "hots;" at opposite phases to each other. [EDIT: In a typical Two-Phase Residential Structure] But that's another lesson. :)

Mm. Right. Who's your parent, Maeva?
I just got out of a relationship with someone who worked in a job making equal pay to mine (maybe a bit more or less, I didn't know her exact salary). She also didn't like to give blowjobs, haha.  I initiated the breakup, but I wouldn't say that her refusal to give blowjobs was a major factor in my decision. However, her dislike of blowjobs was part of an overall theme with her personality. She was overall too aloof, emotionally unavailable, didn't seem to value me very much. I felt like she just wanted somebody who would fit into her goal of being a woman with a successful career dating a man with an equally successful career. I felt more like a trophy or a status symbol, and that she just wanted to exert the minimum effort to keep me around because she cared primarily about her career and personal life.  I dunno, personally my preferences in women do not change no matter how much money she makes. I've been conditioned my whole life to expect to take care of myself and my family solely on my own income. So I view my partner's income more as a bonus. I don't need or want to be financially taken care of. That's just me though and I know other men may feel differently.  Anyway I wouldn't worry too much about not wanting to give blowjobs. IMO you're better off finding someone who doesn't like getting  them that much. Rather than trying to force yourself to do it or whatever. But definitely give it a fair chance if you haven't already.

I know it can't catch private cheats here is my 2 cents from other thread  "(Although its sad, that currently the only way to fight hacks in this scene is only through VAC , and the story with SF and kqly proves that its shit :( , we need more than just VAC to fight hacks.

A friend of mine likes to make fun of my inability to grow a beard (even though, I'm only 23). I just reply "yeah, well at least I have hair on my head". It's probably a low blow, but I'm just tired of this ironic facial hair fad. 
You know, I'd rather not do everything in one language and if I HAD TO I'd be much more likely to pick C# than Java. The platform argument is valid, but I'm hoping it becomes less valid. Moreover it seems like some portion of this argument is "Do everything in the JVM", which isn't limited to Java.  My biggest issue with this argument is it turns me into a fossil. I want to learn new things, stuff I learn from fiddling with functional languages actually makes me a better developer. Even if I'm writing C# in my day to day (which I am), my fucking around with Ruby gives me perspective on things. Its about growth. Sure, only using java may increase your productivity, but I really think it will stonewall your overall level of skill.
even a field goal is good here, Pats haven't stopped Rodgers from driving most of the day
with whom is her credibility being harmed? Reddit? Are you requiring 'authority' be 'fair and balanced'? Because those aren't the same thing (see: political pundit). That doesn't make her less credible, it means thats her perspective. And mostly they're legal documenys, you're free to interpret the prosecutions evidence however you wiish.   Also, Do you really think theres incriminating police interviews that wouldn't have been heard in "the case against adnan syed"?  I'm pretty sure SK would've revealed something noteworthy. And why not request document dumps from serial. They're all doing tons of interviews and you won't get mixed up between advocate and journalist

Yeah it's for homeless addicts (heroin addicts too), not for people going out to party. It's not like you can buy it at the pharmacy, you need to go to one of the places that take care of the addicts. There you will get your heroin/needles and coke. You get a private room to do it in and then you're done and go back to the homeless center. Now you don't have to spend every waking moment looking for crimes to commit, just to get enough money to get your fix. Now you are free in some sense to do other things. You live this much easier life for a time and since you're not constantly wondering about your next fix you wander about your future and if you can change it, and then you just do it. You tell the staff that you want to get off drugs and they help you. Then a small place for you to live is found. Then they help you try to get a simple job.  The trials have shown that within a few years more than half of the hardcore addicts had quit and were living relatively normal lives. One of the clinics even had to shut down because there were not enough homeless addicts anymore.  And this is the humane way to treat addiction. Sadly most societies aren't very humane.

You could get a killer coffee setup for well under $200.

I recommend this for several reasons.  1. It's multiple gifts, which means more presents and who doesn't love more presents? 2. If he is buying coffee out this could have huge financial implications for him; even if he buys fancy beans he will be spending way less money on coffee. 3. He will use and enjoy it every day. 4. A setup like this makes for some *really* good coffee.  I linked to the items that I did because I have personally bought all of them for *my* coffee-guzzling grad-student girlfriend, and they are all excellent. But obviously pick what you think would be best for you/him.
It's both defense and goaltending. And it's not *just* the defensemen as the forwards have been awful at defending this year too. Though the defensemen do, in fact, suck.  I'm not sure there's a lot Nill can do about it right now though. He could probably find a better option for backup goalie. I refuse to believe there's not somebody better than Lindback out there. Though, I'm not sure I trust Nill if he were to acquire another backup. His eye for goalies has been *abysmal* so far. Ellis, Thomas and Lindback are all abjectly terrible. (it also might be time to part with goaltending coach Mike "weak short-side goal" Valley, whose only success story is getting a phenomenally talented goaltender to stop eating so many cheeseburgers)  As for addressing the defense? Not sure much can be done there. Nobody likes to trade good defensemen. I think that's mostly just gonna be an internal fix that the coaching staff and players have to get sorted out. There's some decent options in free agency this summer (if they get there) and now that the Stars aren't gonna have the unholy triumvirate of awful contracts that was Gonchar-Horcoff-Cole, they'll have the money to actually go after one. Of course, that doesn't help this season.  There's still a good chance this thing gets turned around. I mean, the defense actually played well the second half of last season, there's no reason they can't do it again. But it's also just as likely it continues to be awful...
&gt; yeah....as much as I loathe chu for being a deceitful and smug sack of shit, suey park thrashing into him like this is...well just unfair to put it lightly, and is precisely the kind of behavior we have all learned to despise.   Merely reaping what has been sewn.
Yeah, the front and side looks good as far as fit goes, but the back was like 'WTF'.  I'm sure the more $3.50 shirts OP gets hold of, the more practice he'll get.

Well, with AMT you wouldn't need a bunch of statically defined GRE tunnels. The benefit of AMT, if widely deployed, is that anyone could make use of it. However, my point is that there isn't a lot of live streaming on the web. Most of it is on-demand stuff, which does not benefit from multicast treatment. You'll see a lot of benefit for huge events like the Super Bowl, but most other stuff wouldn't benefit from it.

I think the best strategy would be to stay away from comparing directly with prominent socialists and instead brand the campaign as a return to 'real' Democratic progressive principles in the vein of Kennedy and Roosevelt (which also works as a repudiation of the Clintonian view of the party as well.)  But then I'm one of those people who thinks the best that Sanders can do in his campaign is influence the Democratic primary in a certain direction (the way that Ron Paul and Paul Ryan did for the GOP in the last election). Someone needs to force the Democrats to actually talk about these issues and its sure as hell not going to be the GOP. 
I made a post about this a little while ago.  Check it out, I was able to get ETS2 working on my macbook air last week and I have played it a lot.

that didn't happen, because you are a lying douche shit poster and everything you say is made up. 
My favorite changes have been the additions of new worlds and features - big things like Panau, Hammerfell, and Gehenna.  I'm not sure I have a least favorite change. There may have been some additions of plugins and worlds that haven't really piqued my interest, but nothing that I've truly disliked. Though I agree with Mini's dislike, especially since it's not always something we can control.
I think 10 is a good amount for teams. I agree that there are a lot more minors players from S3 ready for majors now but i feel like there are a lot more leaving from S3 than there were from S2 so they are pretty much replacing those who are leaving. Also we struggled to get 10 captains last season, with meth, Wilson, CRSD, ZumgAPanda and Kolapz all leaving we'd have to replace them and get an additional 2, I dont think we would be able to and keep all the captains at an equal enough skill level
I think playing the reserve Panzer in RB is a lot of fun, but maybe that's just me.
Nail biting 
I really wish people would shut the fuck up about the 2 Superbowls. Why should winning the Superbowl be a rationalization for having a suck ass fucking team, plagued by injuries, incompetence, inconsistency and inadequate personell, which has only seen the post season ONE fucking time in 6 years. Fielding a strong, well coached team that can win games is the entire point of this game. We have been downright awful far more often than we've been good, and it's embarrassing.

Does anyone know what the fit is like on the [levis wool blend coat](http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Peacoat-Fleece-Black-Large/dp/B00JB8QDKS/ref=sr_1_17?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417390276&amp;sr=1-17) ? I love the style and price but they don't have my usual size 
Probably just NFC North fans. It is what it is. The refs are insanely bad today.
I legit don't need the lipsticks, though. In fact, a hole in my head would probably be more useful with the sinus pressure I've been having.   I assure you I'm using the phrase correctly. Because I actually do not NEED the lipsticks. I do not NEED to spend that money. But I will. 
that's just like your opinion man. the walking dead games (and The wolf among us) have been some of my favorite games of the last few years. game play-wise they don't offer much (point/click/repeat) but the stories are top notch. I'll deal with average gameplay if the story has enough to keep me engaged.  one of the better examples I'd use is the first mass effect. hated the gameplay but it's one of my favorite series ever. 
You are so pretty. Big, beautiful eyes.
You don't have to be preoccupied with what you hate. I legitimately hate squash (the yellow vegetable), but I don't go around putting energy into it. But the hate is still there.

I think this is just their thing now. Their high-five/handshake/fist bump is just natural. 
A modest tip for what may be a common problem: If things are scaled either too big or too small as to be useless (quite likely), the "home" and "." (on numpad) will help zoom in and locate better around whatever is selected on the F-curve. Speeds things up a bit vs. scrolling with mousewheel or adjusting the scrollbars.  I think the normalize option is also supposed to help a bit with that (seeing what's going on), but using it can sometimes throw off your reference to actual values. Still good for comparing curves with significantly varying ranges though.
I mean, they're obviously not remotely the same caliber, but they're both teams that rely heavily on cut blocking and misdirection in their rushing plays, no? Those are both relatively unusual tactics that defenses don't normally face and thus one of the bigger advantages triple option teams have.
lol k nice joke m8
Same here. I get carded everytime I buy beer/go out. I've heard "you just turn?"or "young face" So many times that I will have an argument every time nowadays.

Yeah, but 99% of people don't know or care about that.
Concussions are, however, becoming an increasing problem in rugby. Not as severe as football, but I think it's a much more significant problem than many people realise.

While we could argue about Donaldson and Cespedes till the cows came home, I would much rather focusing on your "people telling us how to view the players" argument.  Sometimes I slip into a pompous attitude and while sometimes its necessary, sometimes it isn't. /r/baseball has many personalities conflicting with many teams and you are bound to get "those guys". 
I have a random shiny manaphy for you!!
Aww thank you! I only spent an hour or two all up on it (i.e. an accumulated ten minutes here and there when baby permitted it haha).  I wish I could have had more time on it and done a better job but your kind words made me feel much better about it! :) xxxx
No PMO. I'm going to go as long as I can. Sounds hard at first, but if my daily goal is to make it through the day with out PMO, then it is totally manageable. Good luck people
The biggest change to the team strategy is that both the Calgary Flames and Adirondack Flames preach a style of attacking as a 5-man group, and defending as one as well. Add that to fantastic team speed and an aggressive transition game, the Flames system is designed around having Gio, Brodie, Wideman, and Russell often starting rushes, let alone joining them late.
Would this be happening this week?

Another question: Do you think simply upgrading to 10mbps will fix the problem? It wouldn't explain why I didn't have problems before, but if this fixes it, I'm fine with that solution.
We've been trying to do exactly what you are suggesting. So far, we've been failing pretty badly. I think you underestimate the sheer effectiveness of trees. They're not *bad* or *weak* at scrubbing carbon dioxide. We're just pumping *that much* into the atmosphere that they can't keep up. And we can't duplicate their process in any cost-efficient way.

To be honest, I haven't touched PM in a while. After Zenith, I kind of decided I would rather not put much competitive effort into the game, partially because NJ isn't so great for PM and partially because I'm having more fun focusing on Smash 4. Keep an eye on the player Wolf, he's definitely a better PM Link player than I am.

Since I was 5 I knew I wanted to go into the healthcare field. I've always wanted to help humanity through science/medicine. I didn't want to become a doctor because I am really not a people person and the schooling is way too long. I knew if I became a doctor I would have the personality of Dr. House because I have horrible bedside manner, but since I live in the real world I would be fired so quickly instead of everyone loving me.   I am a major science geek.My two favorite sciences are biology and chemistry, the things I majored and minored in respectfully. Pharmacy is the perfect combination of those things. The area of pharmacy I am looking to go into has all of that plus I will not be working with patients directly, but still get to save lives. It is the perfect job for me (minus the weed views) and I really can not see myself being good at anything else.

too bad.... "Under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, police may engage in "reasonable" searches and seizures."   and since "reasonable" is so vague....good luck ever getting any "robbery" or "burglery" charge to help you at all....especially while the police may have jacked your shit...they just put it in a locker and didn't take it home(i do wonder sometimes...and yea corruption...but they do get caught) it not theft. do not let ethics and law get confused in your mind and where your ability to defend those ethics stand in the court of law stand...they don't really give a shit about our liberal agenda for actual change(well that's mine i don't know what you want) they care about their officers, stability, law...those things are black and white and easy to stand behind a podium and defend....cops bust in and take your pot....good luck...they do what they want to an extent, and we will not be able to stop them without risking our own safety(well i think now its become so militarized that change within local policing is inevitable) in a world of Facebook terrorism plots, school shootings...war....yea lots of reasons we just won't be more safe in the future from these kinds of searches unless some radical freedom of security laws were passed to mitigate this type of enforcement....but yea...probably still going to do shit like that...cause well that's how they think...find the "criminals" and yea...if i'm any example of Americans...we do break the law a lot....(well fucking weed is finally getting legalized here but i can't imagine that fixing all the injustice) so...its kind of a them vs. us...which sucks...maybe people should stop saying "fuck da police" and rioting :/ ...or maybe just stop targeting police? ...the fact that so many of our men in blue are getting a target on their back in these squabbles over politics...its really creating a dynamic for no change, increasing instability...and yea well fuck this crap with Michael brown and Ferguson...(not to say the racial component isn't the main issue there but i think there is a class issue there specifically with a predominantly white police dept and mostly ethnic population too.)

Best way is to spend more money. Not a crazy amount, but manufacturers in higher range are more likely to make multiple widths. For sneakers, you're out of luck unless you want specialty running shoes generally. I know that Nike af1s are wide, but you'll have to admit to yourself that some sneakers are just not for you in the end. Try a lot of shoes and see what works, different lasts can give different results even if both are supposed to be the same width. Be professionally measured and know your real size, and do research on how different brands fit/compare  Certain shoes can fuck uou up, if the toe is too long it can flex in the wrong place and jab your foot or cause unnecessary wear since those areas won't be reinforced. You're probably more likely to snag on things/kick things too.

No, no, I like what they're doing now.
I love the company policies that essentially boil down to "anything that is against the law is against policy."   "I was *going* to get drunk and drive but then I remembered that it's against company policy so I decided not to!"  There are also signs on business doors in Oklahoma that say "no firearms allowed except for those carried pursuant to Oklahoma Statues regarding firearms." So basically the signs say "laws that apply within the state also apply inside this building."

That isn't really used anymore, anyone who does use it is pretty much instantly branded a cunt.

But you would be mediocre at explaining it.
I wouldn't consider those to be great examples. A lot of people hate ewoks and gungans and Jabba served little to no real purpose throughout the films other than to delay the story a bit.

When you want to rendezvous with something in space, you have to match orbital speed with it. Comets are moving FAST, and you have to match its orbit. That's easier to do precisely if you speed up slowly and come in behind it on its trajectory.

I'm going to disagree with you.  There's no call in this size range to go anywhere near the supertight measurement with the band.  She's not likely to need the support of an overly tight band, and with the stretch ratio in smaller bands, a 30's wires are likely to distort.   32C and 32D of varying shapes would be the best place to start, as the gapping in the 34C might be too big cups, or a shape incompatibility.  In fact, with only one inch of squish on the ribcage, a 34B/C is quite likely to be tight enough in some brands, although not in stretchy VS.

Italian here. "Lampada" is referred to the UV machine. "Slampadato" could refer to someone who'd got a lot of it.   The word, however, is not an "official" word I think, pretty sure you can't find it in any dictionary (can't check now). Never heard of it.
