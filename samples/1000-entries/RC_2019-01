Yeah man, you obviously didn‚Äôt pay attention.   That was a huge coup for Trump.   She was like 0.0007% Native American or some laughably small percentage.

Doublelift may be amazing, but he sure creates a pretty fucking hostile environment. I get his expectations though, when you want to be the best in the world, not just in the league, you set your teammates the same expectations.

Oh sorry, I read that as you meaning you thought one of the middle states was the first state, not that you meant you thought Delaware was one of the middle states.

I don't think there are that many alternative fiat processors. All of them are basically beholden to Visa and Mastercard and as you know Visa was the first to force Julian Assange to use Bitcoin, (inadvertently funding Wikileaks for decades to come.)  &gt;  I've read somewhere that if someone wants to deposit fiat on ButtFinex they give him the banking details of someone who wants to withdraw.  That's the basics of how Local Bitcoins works as well. It's hard to shut this down. Many people think that Coinbase will probably cave to this pressure and start banning political speech. All they'll be doing is accelerating the crypto education of more Gen-Zers.

Simple living has been the way I lived for years....of course back then I was called cheap:)   I have a friend who is very catholic and was always trying to save my soul. I usually didn't engage with her because I didn't want to ruin our friendship, but we finally had the talk.   She listened to me talk about my feelings for every life on the planet and that I didn't really like the way her god behaved.  She called me a Pagan, so I googled and it turns out she was right. We are still the best of friends though.  I wonder now, if my living the values of simple living meant that I was always a Pagan and if fact can Christians live simply on the land when their beliefs are not about Earth but of the afterlife.  My friend used to quote the bible to me "humans were given dominion over the Earth and the animals" That quote has always pissed me off.

I don't think that the writers know anything about these subjects in a way that is more than superficial, so my answer would be no. Besides, I happen to be familiar with one of the fields they touch upon slightly, and I can tell you from experience that if you learn about something in depth, you might find its representation in TES disappointing. Just enjoy it as at is, but of course it's your choice, do whatever you like ;)

Sometimes - but I find that it's more a person to person issue than a service / specialty issue. Often if you just communicate like adults you can decide together what is actually best for the patient.  Also, I think patients get better care if I take them rather than the service that has made it clear they don't want them, even if I think the reasoning behind that decision on the specialist's part has more to do with their patient load than their clinical judgement.  A few specific scenarios I absolutely hate are the following:  1) Admitting every person over 70 who falls and breaks their hip; even if there are no medical problems I can manage. Sure, I'm happy to take an ortho patient if they have diabetes or hypertension the ortho resident doesn't feel comfortable handling; whatever. I'm talking truly isolated surgical problems, like a broken hip with nothing else going on; it just feels like I'm being taken advantage of. Also, I can rarely answer any of the questions the patient cares about, so I'm just going to have to page the surgical service a bunch to get those answers for my patient.  2) For some reason, our urology service thinks that our medicine residents are better at placing foleys than our nurses. Insisting that I attempt to place a foley when the nurses fail or meet more resistance than they are comfortable with or whatever is just idiocy. Counting med school and residency I've personally placed less than 10 foleys ever. There are nurses that probably place 20-30 in a week. If my nurse tells me they need a urology resident, I'm going to page the urology resident.  3) At least run your attempt to turf patients past your attending. So many times I've admitted someone because the surgical resident overnight said they weren't appropriate for a surgical floor and then we both get yelled at by a surgery attending in the AM, me for not providing the same care the surgical attending would have, and you for turfing a surgery patient.

It is the same connection you lying fuck I even gave you the first half of your address that pings on both your retarded accounts . It‚Äôs coming from the same cock sucking modem and you‚Äôre not even intelligent enough to be running it through a VPN you stupid fucking punk. You‚Äôre all talk and it‚Äôs getting on my nerves.  Why are you still arguing ? The only thing your accomplishing is pissing me off . We both know the truth and I highly highly suggest you waking in the other fucking direction cock sucker

The layer of cloth below the starter does seem to help in moderating the temperature from what I was seeing. Even if I have a dried layer on top when it ran too hot with this method it's easy to just stir it back in when feeding. It can be annoying when you're trying to gauge activity from the top though since you dont see the bubbles underneath.  The lactobacillus are definitely important and do provide the right environment so the good bacteria and yeast can grow. It sounds like you had a similar situation to my starter before I started keeping it in a warm environment, so once you find that sweet temperature spot things should start chugging along!

Definitely not all LE and prosecution are corrupt.  But a large majority play political hardball with anyone who wants to reduce their power or add checks or balances.  That isn't necessarily corrupt, but it inadvertently protects the corrupt. Reducing LE and prosecution powers or placing checks and balance will reduce their ability to convict the guilty in order to protect the innocent.  Some balance needs to be found.  I think that the current balance is too far towards damaging the rights of the innocent.  But it wouldn't be a good balance to require LE to get a warrant in order to say "Boo!" to you either.  Very few people support having power taken away from them that they feel helps in doing their job.  In this case that power is being abused by many, but not most and needs to be curtailed IMO. The Innocent Man the book was better than the documentary IMO.  It did more on pointing out systemic problems as well as some questionable actions of LE and prosecution.  I think that you make a valid point against the documentary, but I also think you are in part spoiled by MD and LR's work in MaM 1 &amp; 2 as are most of us. :-)

You absolutely should while you are in school and the results aren't as bad as the real world. Because the difference between being fucked up by a mugger or junkie is being able to take that extra hit and stay standing. Because as soon as you go down in a fight, that's it.  Now, you don't have to go out in the real world and fight, that is what martial arts are for, to get the shit kicked out of you in a safer environment. But to start off in a good place, someone needs to have dropped you once or twice when there is less force in the encounter

I think the implication is that because OFA contains the essence of the previous users it can achieve power beyond what a single person could handle.   Ie we've long since passed singularity means OFA is stronger than natural quirks can get. This makes sense in how it was able to defeat AFO. AFO is limited by the physical capacity for power of its holder.   This interpretation seems to go well with the other things they've said to Midoriya, you are not alone and all that.   Of course I could be way off base with this, but we'll see

Him and a lot of other boys.  Until about World War I, it was the custom in many parts for children to remain basically genderless until they began their formal education.  The boy's transition to pants, or his "[breeching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeching_%28boys%29)", was a rite of passage marking the transition from babyhood to childhood (which in those days was more like miniature adulthood).

I used to be a chef, I've studied a lot about psychology, I'm good at building things, I know a fair amount about scavenging in the forest, and (I know it sounds weird) I like butchering meat and fish (it feels like a kind of homage to the animal's death. I can physically ensure that the animal is not going to waste).  EDIT: I didn't really think about it since it's just so common around here, but I know how to tend the soil, sow seeds, monitor plant growth, ..., harvest fruits and vegetables, and process them. Additionally, I have the recipe for various vinegars in my head, and I know how to raise various animals.

It ain't miles ahead of IW. People hate on IW bc they never played it or just roll with popular opinion bc they can't think for themselves. I'll take BO3 &gt; IW &gt; BO4 MP all day. IW is still less of a hero shooter than BO4. BO4 isn't even COD, it's a dumbed down Overwatch. BO4 isn't as bad as WW2, AW or Ghosts, the actual worst 3 CODs in history, but it's less of a COD game than MW3, IW or WAW, the C-tier CODs.

15 yards + an ejection is ridiculous in my opinion. There needs to be a yellow card red card system. The way the rule is written is ejecting too many defensive players right now, which is almost always followed by their backup being exposed. 
If you choose to shoot The Bean Man, Max pulls the trigger and nothing comes out. Frank doesn't get hurt but says that he will remember that she tried to shoot him.

Your are correct, this is a power given to the federal government. My problem with it is how the supreme court has interpreted these laws in ways, in my opinion, greatly over-reach there original intent.   In court cases like Wickard vs. Filburn and Gonzales_v._Raich, the supreme court has found the federal government has the power to regulate crop growth by private citizens, with no intent or practice of trading over state borders, because it may theoretically effect interstate commerce. Which to me is fucking insane. It gives the feds carte blanch to exercise powers over anything that could, in theory, effect interstate commerce.   For those unfamiliar with this vary important case. From Wikipedia.   "That argument stems from the landmark New Deal case Wickard v. Filburn, which held that the government may regulate personal cultivation and consumption of crops because of the aggregate effect of individual consumption on the government's legitimate statutory framework governing the interstate wheat market."

I agree, but like the other games in the past 2k tries to make mycareer unique from a normal path to the nba. But at least this year you skip cutscenes and you can skip right to the nba when you make your player. In all I would like to see 2k implement a way to choose which path you want or a story mode like madden did, or they could take a poll on Twitter about it.
Lady, whatever you are, make another two kids! You are a genius! 
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, that was clever any way you look at it.
Two things.  1. You did break their rules, under the agreement you signed to play that alone is enough for removal from the field, I agree the ref/owner should also follow rules set by the field but that is inconsequential to your case.  2. Someone else blatantly being a dick is not proof, if you‚Äôre ripping people with a high rps gun it‚Äôs still being a dick, yes you were being a dick within the confines of the rules but you were still being a dick. 
There‚Äôs no such thing as chipset compatibility for CPU coolers. Just check that the cooler supports the CPU socket. I‚Äôm pretty sure 99.9% of coolers you can buy will support your socket so that‚Äôs not a problem. The other thing to check is if the cooler will physically fit in your case. Check the max cooler height allowed by your case. 
I think it‚Äôs honestly based on how many people are in a clear line of view of it... I‚Äôve found even the smallest things in the map will stop it from registering on people

Hello /u/Joshenkstone! Unfortunately, your post was automatically removed because you do not exceed our karma threshold.

Way too much. I for one should keep more for myself. We do have an open circle of friend where people share without taboo or shame. I remember years ago wanting to share really personnal stuff. And l told them guys girls share stuff all the time so am going to as well. Hopefully it will bring us closer together. And you know what it did. And we still share almost everything together. Best group of friends. It has been 15 years l haven't shook their hands only hugs between us. True story. 
These changes sucks whats happening now is scooter will pop up around 3pm-9 bc the battery only last short trips now. It's a way for them to get people to pay another $1 bc the battries run out faster during the day and the time 9pm hits theres not many to grab bc there all 49% or lower

Probably because wind and solar work well in you know the parts of Canada where 99% of the population lives.  Remote access communities are difficult to service.  Think about it, how would you install a 100m hub height wind turbine in a village that has no road to it, and has basically no sun for several months of the winter. Wind and solar are good options for much of where we live, especially if there is a decent supply of hydro to even out the troughs and peaks.

Yes. I know that they're not all the same, but there's a special level of awfulness and assholery that I've only seen from childfree people irl and on places like /childfree.  It's impressively awful enough  that any association is enough cause to prefer to avoid a person. Some cf are teachers or work with kids.. but I would not want to trust somebody from within that crowd ( somebody who just might be someone who spends time chuckling at any variation of all the hilarious, dehumanizing names to call children other than "spawn" or "crotch droppings" on /childfree ) anywhere near my kids.

If you take a look at [Fender's custom shop design guide (pdf)](http://www.fmicassets.com/sites/fender.com/themes/img/customshop/2018/2018_Custom_Shop_Design_Guide.pdf) there's a section that covers their different ageing styles.  The descriptions for the lightly aged ones (the Closet Classics and Journeyman Relic) do seem to mention they have slightly oxidised hardware, but I don't think they look particularly rusty. Interestingly the Lush Closet Classic description makes it sound as though even a well cared for vintage guitar will have some hardware oxidisation.  If you're against even lightly oxidised hardware perhaps you could buy a NOS (New Old Stock) and relic the other parts of the guitar but leave the hardware alone?

Picture the dark waters filled with the echo of waves from just your movement in the water. The green, dim light shining into the waters mixing with the current to give you brief flashes of this beasts cold dead features. Your heart, your gear, and a silent echo is all you hear but anytime you turn away you swear that it's positioned a little differently every time. Pushing yourself to stay submerged below it as to not drift too close sends clusters of bubbles up towards its gaping maw coalescing into the open roof of its mouth, either the bubbles float deeper into its throat or attempt to squeeze through the gaps in its teeth, and just like you would if it erupted to life as you gaze at it in the cold, green murk, the bubbles break apart and float past its once live eyes. But now, as in life, they are cold and black.  He said not to stop!

Personal theory, but I think it's because genius is commonly portrayed in movies, television and literature as being accompanied by apathy. Acting like you're blas√©  about everything is part of the character type that these people want to portray because they think, subconsciously, that this is the way they're 'supposed' to act if they're as intelligent as they want to believe.

Man, some of the posters in this sub would have everyone think you're Superman for having survived going up there past dark. Big ups for getting out there and living a little.
Planning a long occupation because they built basic military infrastructure to protect our troops there?!?!  Based on that comment, they built up a basic logistical and defensive network.  They were simply protecting and supplying our troops the best way we can while we are there. Bridges and other things like that are needed for logistics and moving equipment and men.  Airstrips are also needed for logistics reasons.  FOBs are a standard way to remain behind cover while on the front line.  
Friends, family, or loved ones; we can grow apart from them when we least expect it. It's a part of life. Often, when friends distant themselves, usually it's because they're going through something that they need to figure out for theirselves. If you've done everything to ensure you were a good friend, then trust when I say it's enough and it probably doesn't have much to do with you. Unless you were a terrible friend who treated her badly, that definitely could've pushed her away. But according to your circumstances, it sounds like you're a patient and thoughtful individual who really just depended on her company and support.   Also, if you consider yourself a good friend to her, you would support her and give her the space and time she needs to do whatever she needs. Take this time to be by yourself and be a good friend for her by letting her know the door is always open whenever she's ready to be close again. Friends don't need to always talk and be around each other 24/7 to have a wonderful relationship. Unless this is your significant other or someone you're dating, it'd be different. But usually, friends will always somehow find their way back to each other after intervals of living their lives and doing their things.

No. He doesn't care about that. He just thinks white. He's expliclity asked why we can't have more immigrants from Norway.  Would not be surprised if he's thinking about about tall beautiful blonde women and how awesome it would be if hordes of them came streaming in over some border.

I'd like a tag as well, /u/ct139 not trying to be a dick here, but its pretty obvious when people cherry pick the high comps instead of being transparent. The 2 highest ones you posted are 2 weeks old, which is very different than 2+ years old.  $950 https://www.ebay.com/itm/Sinn-104-I-St-Sa-Leather-Strap-Automatic-Wristwatch-under-warranty-/202470621533  $911 https://www.ebay.com/itm/Sinn-104-ST-Sa-I-/202454369931  $900 Unsold https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/a8x065/wts_sinn_104_st_sa_i/  $850 https://www.reddit.com/r/Watchexchange/comments/9fk20e/wts_sinn_104_st_sa_i_reduced_price/  I am not saying there are some others sold for more (although they are only 2 weeks old and under warranty) but some transparency would go a long way for people to make an educated decision on whether to buy in or not or if the price should be adjusted.

&gt; I'm not sure why. The .NET framework is what sits under powershell. Learning C# necessarily means you learn the framework and that's how you can extend powershell to do the things people haven't written modules for yet. &gt;  &gt;  &gt;  &gt; When you see a stackoverflow past that solves your problem in C# you should be able to take that code and convert to powershell. It's part of the skill set (even if it's only on the periphery).  Because I don't really give a toss what sits under Powershell, I strongly dislike the C# language.

No, it is something he came up with himself. He received advises from NASA and the PR people, but in the end it was his decision to say what he said, and as far as we know he came up with it himself. In one regard he did receive a suggestion which was more or less an order: he was to avoid the topic of religion.  On Apollo-8 (first mission which orbited the moon) the mission commander, Frank Borman read the book of Genesis on live TV, and there was some fallout from it NASA didn't want to deal with again. That's why Armstrong was asked to avoid the topic of religion. Also for this reason it was unannounced and not shown on TV that Buzz Aldrin had wine and wafer with him, and had a private communion after the landing of the Lunar Module.  There is also a funny anecdote which is told every time this topic is mentioned.  The commander of Apollo-12, Pete Conrad, was friends with an Italian journalist, Oriana Fallaci, who was convinced that the famous words were given into Armstrong's mouth by NASA. Pete Conrad of course denied this vehemently, and told Ms Fallaci, that he can say whatever he damn pleases on the occasion of his own landing. The lady was unconvinced, so Conrad offered to bet 500 USD that he will say: "Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me." Namely Pete Conrad was a short man by astronaut standards, actually he was the shortest in the whole corps, while Neil Armstrong was a rather tall man.  Needless to say, Pete Conrad did utter the agreed sentence on live TV, though whether or not he collected his win, I do not know.  Source: Andrew Chaikin: A man on the Moon

You think someone with hate that deep seeded will give it up? More likely she will consider herself a victim of Jews now that got her fired. She literally said she feels zero sympathy when writing a paper on the holocaust. Hate that deep doesnt go away. Remember it wasnt just adults, but tiny Jewish children she felt no sympathy for.

I can't find one for interceptions at the moment but here's [the analysis for why a TD is worth 20 yards](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index4db6.html?p=633). It's calculated by finding how many expected points are gained from moving down the entirety of the football field to find how many "points" a yard is worth. Then using this you go backwards to find how many yards a TD over a FG is worth.  How I like to visualize it is that the yards from 20 yards out to the goal line don't really have almost any "real value" because a FG attempt from the 20 yard line is only marginally more difficult than a FG attempt from the goal line. This means that the entirety of the "value" of that field position is concentrated at the goal line.   Or in other words driving from 20 yards out to 1 yard out is worth nothing without getting that one last yard, in which you acquire all the value of those yards.

The dual wielding option does seem really cool.

Well, that is what you linked. Here's another source that it *does not* do any redundancy as you stated: https://serverfault.com/questions/377892/zfs-how-do-you-restore-the-correct-number-of-copies-after-losing-a-drive. So no, FreeNAS, ZFS or whatever you choose to use, does not have file based RAID.   Obviously running RAID0 is extremely risky and probably not very smart. But what you are trying to do is almost worse. It gives a wrong sense of security, thinking you have high redundancy and thinking you can't lose data, so you lack a bit on backups. Eventually the whole thing crashes down on you and you lose everything. What you are trying to do simply cannot be done in the way you think it can. It can be replicated, it can be backed up but in the end, *it is not RAID* and it has *a lot* of faults. Just use backups instead. It would effectively be the same as some of the things you linked, just better. The other types don't offer redundancy but just replication. Backups offer backups, which in essence is better than replication. If you delete a file accidentally the replication will delete it too. If you overwrite it by mistake, it will do it too. Backups on the other hand, will keep the files in the original state for the period you want.

Look, I'm not saying JBJ knew that he would injure him. I'm saying that kneeing him in the groin would obviously help slow down Gus and thus take away some footwork which is a huge strength of his. JBJ is GOAT material - picograms or not - and I wouldn't put it past such a fighter to pull off a move like that. But this is pure speculation.   Alex hinted in the swedish part of the interview that he thought it was intentional, and the guy said it with admiration for JBJ - not "oh that fucker only won cause he cheated".

You kind of covered this, but the original release was actually really small scale in terms of devs, even by the standards of the time. The success of the title totally caught them by surprise, and I'd argue kind of ate out the company as a sort of money-cancer. It was only after the monumental success of vanilla that the dev team ballooned.
Proud of you, friend. Wishing you strength and peace for the year ahead.

I mean I‚Äôm just speculating on what they are dropping. It would be awesome if they dropped it now or maybe even during the Super Bowl.   But this is my most likely scenario.   Though I‚Äôve been trying to find the quotes for the executive that said it was confirmed Summer 2019 and haven‚Äôt had any luck. All the links to it being confirmed Summer 2019 use this quote where it doesn‚Äôt say Summer 2019:  ‚ÄúYou know, the [creators] the Duffer Brothers and [director] Shawn Levy have worked really hard and they understand the stakes are high,‚Äù Holland said. ‚ÄúThey want to deliver something bigger and better than what they did last year. And so, they really want to take the time to get it right. I think it‚Äôs gonna be a fantastic season, it‚Äôs gonna be worth the wait.‚Äù

So your basal metabolic rate is right around 17-1800 calories. If you eat 2000, you gain a little. If you run and burn 600, you lose some.
So true - solid advice.  
Go to your windows settings, system, focus asist, and turn ‚Äúwhen in a game‚Äù option off. I hope it works for you. It used to take 15 secs to alt-tab and now it only takes a few.

I don't think its really fair to fault them for taking so long to hire a HC last time. Like it or not, Arizona is not a top choice for quality HCs. They played off the whole Wilks hire, but it's more likely that they had to hire him since no one else wanted the job. I would assume that even if they were "faster" we would have still ended up with Wilks because we had no QB, a terrible offensive line, and most of our better players were aging vets.   I am curious to see how having Rosen tips the scale. We won't beat out the Browns, or Jets, and unfortunately, the other openings have way better rosters than we do, but maybe Rosen tips the scale in our favor

I was pulled over and fined because i picked my phone up just to look who was calling me repeatedly 5+ times ...I was worried it was an emergency...anyway ... I asked the officer that question. He said if your phone is mounted you can use for GPS type uses, I'm assuming skipping a song would be fine too, because it's basically the same as adjusting the controls on the console. Got a magnetic mount the next day. Everyone should get one asap.

I'm going to have to agree with bum_bling_iduot here, the fact that you have any freedoms at all is because 200+ years ago, some smart people had the thought to not rule the USA, but to govern it with input from the people that live here. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect, but I can also guarantee that what you do won't be perfect to someone 200 years from now either. I look at other first world countries and don't see another one I'd want to live in over the USA. So for all our faults, it could be worse; and I'm glad that we, at least, have the option to try and make it better.   Changes need to be made, especially term limits. I'll even go along with once you are old enough to vote, you should be old enough to run for office; but as long as you can vote, you should be able to run for office. 
It's exactly the hit they are trying to get rid of.

Ah, I forgot. You only like to contribute to the conversation when it doesn't mean admitting you're wrong.

John Harbaugh comes to mind, but he also worked secondary.  Same with Marv Levy, Bill Cowher, Bill Belichick, Dick Vermeil and Mike Ditka.  Who STARTED out ST but worked other positions.  None were Pure ST Coaches that I can remeber....maybe Gaunce(sp) a while back.  But Harbaugh probably the last one in recent history.  ST have to coach both offense and defense, so they're the best suited for a HC gig.  But interesting it's not a glamour position so you typically give HC spots to offense or defense.  Also because those coaches get to network more and can bring a Staff together quickly.
....but they built a new emblem; they built structures and ships and god knows what with the intention of never seeing her again. You don‚Äôt just hire a graphic design artist out of the blue for a new logo in a galactic enterprise - the changes were supposed to stick. 
I just said he was President elect, do you not understand how that works? What are you offended by though? You're probably one of those idiots that says Trump isn't your President but you're over here arguing semantics about what it officially means to be President and not President elect. If somebody puts Pence on the back of their helmet in November 2024 I'm not going to be offended.

What is it with asian games requiring every screen have some cute girl smiling for no reason?

"Hollywood Police" - I take it you're not familiar with their level of corruption.  "No gun was recovered during a search ‚Äî possibly washed out with the tide." &lt;-- This is all the "evidence to the contrary" you need, right here. I guess they didn't use metal detectors and find the shell either. The blood spatter was just from getting shot, don't worry about where it was. The lack of powder residue on his hands was probably because of some high wind, never mind that powder residue can't be washed off and remains for weeks.  "Family members have declined to speak publicly..." Huh, weird. If they knew this was a suicide, you would think they would come out and say leave us alone, stop harassing us! He was depressed, have some respect! You know, like other families do.  You are aware that it would be pretty easy for the police and/or a murderer to send some text messages from the phone for that convenient truth in the story?  If they want, they can even make the whole conversation up in the report and threaten the family. If you knew the PD was involved, would you say anything?  Unless you're going to hire me and pay a *very* premium price for additional "evidence to the contrary" little sheep, I've no reason to risk my life to go travel over there and find it.  There are *plenty of reasons* to QUESTION the official story. There is no reason not to.

I used a couple of fretboard apps. Can't remember what they're called but it was kind of fun... Like a game. You'd compete for time, rank up how many you could get right in a row etc. I found remembering the relationships ultimately too slow. I wanted to just *know* a note name, not have to stop and work it out. I find for the most part now that I do know them and it has freed me up. Makes a massive difference soloing over chords. Now I just need to work on not being so sloppy.  But short answer is that it's not that hard and with a few minutes a day you can get there pretty quickly. The other thing I found helped was working up from what I knew and gradually expanding. So not trying to do it all in one go.   Just looked on Google Play store and there are tons of free apps.

Yaaay it‚Äôs 2019.  Can‚Äôt wait for everything to be exactly the fucking same.
My theory is that they didn't make any deal, but that Tyrion simply knew that Cersei would betray them.   He just didn't care, he knows that Dany needs to march North, so he chose not to advice Dany about Cersei's likely betrayal because otherwise he was afraid that she would stay in the South and the WWs would win. It's still a betrayal, but a betrayal of inaction rather than an active betrayal.  
Are we not doing phrasing any more?
"Toxic masculinity" is a controversial phrase even in MensLib. Why would promotes it's usage when feminists aren't even entirely settled on using it themselves? I also don't think you understand the insidious nature of "toxic masculinity" as used by feminists. It's used to frame men's issues as women's issues thereby refocusing gender equality as being all about helping women and combating misogyny. If you think we can cede control of the lexicon on gender to feminists yet somehow still have a say in the conversation, you are extremely naive.

Ok let's begin.   Taste:  heroin can only be bitter. So bitter it lasts minutes after initial taste. The most accurate fake dope looked spot on, texture, consistency, color, weight, shot color.....however, as is routine for me, I taste the tiny residue on the circular plunger grip/ handle. That's what I use to stir and mix my shot because my doctor that removed my surgery said using the rubber black part should never be used. It goes inside the rig carrying bacteria/ particulate you tried filtering with the cotton.  So, this dope was spot on and I thought good old above average heroin. The taste tho... Multiple attempts... Bitter.... BUT THE BITTER DISSIPATED IN SECONDS. FAKE!  so, always taste for lingering bitterness.  TASTE FENT: most commonly sweet tasting. Sometimes has notes of floral( dead serious) a medicine taste is also reported. I personally check for a slight tangy sensation. It really is jus tangy without a flavor to that tangy sensation.  Since heroin will never taste completely sweet, you,have fent..  Next, color:  heroin can range from white to dark brown. Greyshg concrete.  Now. The real indicator is how the shot looks while prepping. Heroin off the streets simply is never clear. Unless you're receiving pure heroin from a hospital, its got color. Even SEA #4 HAS A FAINT YELLOWNESS TO IT.  Most heroin goes from piss yellow to near black ice tea.  Now, almost always it's not cloudy but clear when that dark. As in, you can see that the dark color isn't from being murky.  Usually there's a golden tint/ hue with the color.  Now, remember what I said above that you won't be getting medical grade, so  HEROIN will never completely clear. Anyone who tells you it does is plain fuckin wrong. Color, fent: fent is most commonly seen with absolutely no color. Clear. Although it can be mixed with heroin and have3 color that way.   Now CONSISTENCY IN POWDER STATE:  this one is less revealing HEROIN: Can be white flakes looking like paint chips to tan powder that has some fluff to it. But heroin WILL NEVER HAVE SHINY CRYSTAL TYPE SHIT IN IT.  FENT: comes in a variety of cuts and consistency. Often has sparkly glitter looking shit. If its super white, Fluffy, and extremely fine particulates, it might be fent. As I said this observation is less informative.  LAST STEP: ALWAYS DO A TEST BUMP/ SHOT   NOW, WITH THESE CERTAINTIES, COMMONALITIES, AND USING EXPERIENCE, A USER SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM BEING HIGHLY confident identifying their product. Before or after the tester too.  This will,become easier with experience after you start paying attention to the characteristics of your,drug.   I've used this for 15 years IVING WIthout any surprise disasters.  Anyone sayin this is false or BS are newbs who dk shit. Any veteran user will have this knowledge as well. This can and will save your life. Good luck abf be smart.   TOO ALL,THE HATERS, YOU ARE DISCOURAGING HARM REDUCTION, THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR THIS,SUB.   PEACE FRIENDS!

Have you ever been in a fight, or have at least watched MMA? Kicks are not that predicable. Being aware of the situation the could get you kicked or shot is one thing. Knowing WHEN that kick/shot happens is another. Unless you are the flash, I highly doubt you can see a kick/shot coming without anticipating it. But even anticipation is glorified guessing. That's what makes it surprising.  This conversation had derailed way past when what we originally were debating about. If you still have not gotten it by this point. I'm not even going to to bother anyone, because then I'm just fighting intended ignorance.

Nope, I mean running into NPCs who asks you to do a task/quest for them or finding a parchment that sets off a chain of events of quests. I guess the most similar thing in there at the moment would be the time limited quests that came with the events I.e. the one where you had to track down that lady's crew mates in forsaken shores or that guy who asked you to kill the meg. Quests like that but random and more rewarding.

I very vividly remember beating this at about 10. I remember getting stuck at trinexx not knowing that I had to use the sword after using the rod on the elemental head. So I was stuck there for a while. But I definitely powered through and it waws the very first Zelda I ever beat. The second was Link's awakening. The third, Ocarina of time. 4th, majora's mask. And on and on to the rest of the series.  I remember getting it for my birthday back in 1997. I had just turned 9.   It wasn't THAT hard. You died a lot, but learned to stock potions and fairies. I was also ahead of my class academically and am decently sure I'm ASD (About to get tested in a couple months).

I have yet to be to a ton of islands but the ones I have been to the claims were all mostly the same company. 
Nice. This shit always seemed scetchy as all hell. Usually caused me to just remove said app.
I was with you until you started talking about human shields and forced sterilizations. Those claims simply aren‚Äôt true. While I can‚Äôt deny individual horrible things have occurred, they‚Äôre not governmental policies. Israel routinely goes out of its way and puts its own soldiers in harms way to prevent human casualties, while the PA / Hamas do the exact opposite - they hide their weapons in schools and hospitals.   Also, while it‚Äôs tragic what is happening to the Palestinians living in the territories...what‚Äôs the alternative? If Israel didn‚Äôt do what it does, their citizens would be under constant threat from terror attacks; another intefada would rise up. They‚Äôve only stopped because Israel has put in place these things to protect their people.   A governments primary responsibility is to protect their citizens. Israel is doing that, as is its right. The Palestinian people need a government who will do the same for them. Until then, everyone loses.   We can go back and forth, and I appreciate your civil tone. But we won‚Äôt change each other‚Äôs mind as we are living and accepting different facts. I can show you evidence of my claims, you could show me evidence of yours. I‚Äôll qurstion your source as you‚Äôll question mine. This is the problem of the world today.

You claim to be here in good faith yet you ignore literally everyone of my points, in favor of focusing on me *accurately * pointing out your moral failings. The two most substantial points you blindly ignored are these two.  Go fuck yourself. 
Same thing in Sweden, Swedish citizens have been displaced by a suicidal do-gooder government that evicted Swedish families to replace them with Syrians. It's insanity. People in trouble should be helped in the country of origin so that things get stabilized there first and they don't need to become refugees. 
I was not.
Eh, it‚Äôs okay

It's not?   Is it being ejected out of the atmosphere?   Sequestered as long term ice?
It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheek bones. 
I wasted an hour making this tripe. It even took two takes since I used the wrong SD card at first. I could have gone out drinking.  &amp;#x200B;  ^(And I'll fight anyone who disses bourbons they're fab.)
I think it makes a pretty big difference. Exercising 1-2 hours a day definitely gives me some flexibility in my diet. If I stop working out I have to pay closer attention to what I eat otherwise I'll gain weight. It's just part of the equation though. Diet = 80% Exercise = 20% IMO

Seeing other bloggers‚Äô spending is the only thing that makes me think Sarah might be financing most of her shopping with LTKI funds. BUT.....there‚Äôs no way she‚Äôs converting as many sale as most of these accounts. On the other hand, I could see basically all of them racking up massive amounts of shopping debt (EmGem especially....I think her husband is a hospitalist who is just out of residency, so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs established in a super well-paid specialty).

The video is short and obviously doesn‚Äôt show the entire confrontation. Considering they were being told to leave at the beginning before they were being forcibly removed implies that they were asked numerous times to disperse, or at the very least, move to the side  If the assumption is that these people gathered and within 30 seconds they started getting manhandled and pepperballed, then it‚Äôs probably wrong
No he's American. 
We had our first 90 minute class today and loved it! Hope they‚Äôll do it every month (maybe first Saturday) or weekly. 
Yeah that was kinda the part I didn't really understand. If I were him and realised the person I cared about was upset, I'd try my best to change the situation so they'd feel better rather than giving a lame apology and carrying on with my shitty ditching plans.
You‚Äôre

It‚Äôs actually pretty similar to Murray. I have probably 10 Murray autos and I thought this was his too for a second haha  Would be a little weird to get a vintage puck signed by a current player though

Two components:  1) Game logic is not at 60FPS, only the display engine. Some game engines run at the refresh rate, but that has huge problems associated with it (for instance, a low frame rate can make physics simulations go wrong if you link them).  2) You can use algorithms to determine the exact time something would happen. You can therefore have higher accuracy than the rate at which the physics engine updates. EG: If you are 10m away, and I fire a shot at you at 100m/s, I can calculate it will hit you in 0.1s. You do not need to calculate it every 0.1s to have that accuracy.
Thing I look forward to for 2019  * People saying that the BRZ/86 should have more power * People sharing their unpopular opinion that are actually popular * Another record breaking year for crossover sales * Headlights getting brighter and brighter and subsequent the threads complaining about them * r/Cars giving condolences to sedans that died, even though it wasn't very good and largely forgettable * FCA putting a V8 in the Jeep renegade * People wishing for cars with features and specs when one already exist, but they don't want THAT one * Some more manual circle jerk * Benchracing 0-60 times and make a big deal about 0.5s difference - Something something Nissan drivers something something FCA unreliable - the financial demise of FCA and Tesla that is bound to happen anytime now - The "slow car fast" cope and the mortal sin that is enjoying high HP cars on public roads - and the slight utter of defeat when Mazda's SkyavtivX motor isn't all what it's meant to be

If they do so, then where are they going to profit from? Plus, rams are not the reason the phones are stopped supported from the OEM, I believe it's the CPU.

My understanding (after a similar experience) is that they like to try other antidepressants first when there's comorbid anxiety, but it's not wholly contraindicated.  Of course, you can't make that decision if you don't even *ask* your patient if they have a history of anxiety... damn college health center.

Work and save and don‚Äôt let anyone know your plans. Find a roommate or friend you trust to get a roommate with. Plan ahead and get it done. Then live your live as a normal adult. Done.
At least you're being honest. 
It is 7 now. 
Adrian was different with plan and motive. But I wouldn‚Äôt say he was the best. Slade had a good plan but the motive was ridiculous. The real best villain was Malcolm cause not only his motive and plan made the most sense (and didn‚Äôt involve Oliver really); But he beat Oliver almost twice. He was intimidating when fighting and had a stare that just gave you a slight chill. Plus he only attacked The Glades and not the rest of the city.  At the end of the first season not even Diggle (who had been in the army) could beat him. Oliver won with just an arrow lying on the ground. He barely beat him the second time. Slade was good as he taught him how to fight but his plan and motive were weak. I would put in third after Prometheus.
I love you. Sincerely. And I hope every day gives you a little more happiness and a little more joy
I actually just removed that. I mistakenly included it when I saw the release date for the XBox One port.

Arial or adept. Adept if you have fast, split second reaction dodges for counterattacks, and Arial (I use this) to jump in the air, attacking you enemy in the air. This works very well for mounting a monster, which if done right topples it (very useful)

I LOVE Costco. :) They have lots of frozen organic veggies. Way cheaper than elsewhere. And I end up eating them all, so frugal for me. And the organic eggs are cheaper than any place else. And I can get pork and chicken for my dog cheap and lamb for me!
Yeah, that's what I will most likely end up doing. Gotta get me a Arch flash drive though.  Thanks and happy new year :)

Along these lines, there's no such thing as undergrads teaching sections at Dartmouth.
I was wondering, if I had a speedstacks cube timer, is there anyway I could hook up a camera so as it timed it would video, then when I was done it would save the solve as it‚Äôs own video named as the time I got. That way I would have a video of every solve I do.
Absolutely, yes.  They randomly pop into my head.  Makes me wonder if I pop into peoples‚Äô heads, too.

The only thing I don't like about MassGenie is that they are sort of a middle man so if you have any issues with what your order, expect a more drawn-out process as MassGenie support usually has to communicate with the supplier. A keyboard I bought was defective and it took about a month for me to finally get a free RMA.
My goal is to get in right when open when everyone is still hungover and resolutioners are still asleep or dealing with first day of gym anxiety and double up to make up for the lack of gym today.
Why are Costco employees so fucking attractive? It isn't even fair, I'm just trying to shop.
I legitimately thought it was a plastic straw at first.
For me personally, they‚Äôre are lots of legal benefits to being married. For some people, they want to celebrate their commitment to spending their lives together because they love each other. None of this means you have no desire to fuck other people the moment you get married.

&gt; My plan for the coming year is to keep moving forward, being the best I can be on any given day, and making the things that are important to me a priority. I may not achieve all of them, but as long as I'm making the effort, I'm succeeding.  This is kind of inspiring.  Ty :-)  Glad you had so many positive changes &amp; ahh‚Äî can relate to the mom.

From left to right:  Brockhampton - iridescence: A great album from the best boyband in show business. I liked the Saturation trilogy a bit more, but this was a solid commercial debut. The album is pressed on clear vinyl.  Childish Gambino - Awaken, My Love!: More of a fan of Donald Glover when he raps, but this is an amazing album. The production is very funky, wild, and soulful. I‚Äôd recommend it, even if you are more of a rap fan.  Childish Gambino - Because the Internet: LOVE this album. In my opinion, it‚Äôs his best in terms of lyrics and being conceptual. My only gripe is that the record labels don‚Äôt say what songs are on each side, which is quite annoying.  Daft Punk - Discovery: One of my favorite electronic albums. Even 17 years later, this album sounds fantastic. Still need to procure a copy of Random Access Memories.  Denzel Curry - TA13OO: One of my favorite albums this year. Denzel brings incredible lyricism over 3 different acts. It‚Äôs also on this translucent red vinyl with white splatter.  Kali Uchis - Isolation: This album is a bit out of my comfort zone, but if you‚Äôre a fan of Flower Boy by Tyler, the Creator, this album is definitely worth a listen. It‚Äôs pressed on opaque blue vinyl.  Kanye West - MBDTF: One of my favorite albums of all time. This was the one that started my collection. The covers are interchangeable, and it includes a poster. Just like everyone else, I hate how they pressed it. Why does only Monster take up one side?!  Kanye West - ye: The second album from Kanye‚Äôs insane summer of releases, this record shows him at his most vulnerable. No filler whatsoever. I still need Kids See Ghosts and DAYTONA though...  Kendrick Lamar - good kid, m.A.A.d city: A classic hip hop album from this decade. Listen to it if you haven‚Äôt. Songs like Sing About Me are beautiful.  Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly: Possibly the best rap album of the decade. A beautiful meeting of jazz and hip hop. It‚Äôs not an easy listen, but it is very worth it.  Mac Miller - GO:OD AM: This was somewhat difficult to find, but it is my favorite album from him. Had to get it after his passing. RIP.  SZA - Ctrl: Another great R&amp;B record. One of my favorite albums from 2017. It‚Äôs pressed on translucent green vinyl.  Travis Scott - Rodeo: Best trap album, change my mind. The experimental production that Travis brought on his debut definitely turned some heads. While I don‚Äôt think his other work is as great, this is a fantastic rap album.  A Tribe Called Quest - Midnight Marauders: CLASSIC. I even like this album a bit more than The Low End Theory. I‚Äôd give it a listen if you‚Äôre into jazzy hip hop.  That‚Äôs it! Well beyond the 300 character minimum, but that‚Äôs alright.

Can you do a lead test on that Louis necklace when you get it?
My lady squeezes her tits *hard* when I go down on her. Aside from that she really never touches herself, so it's the biggest fucking turn on. I definitely watch for that.  If she looks down I immediately shut my eyes though cuz she gets embarrassed lol
I'll join the trend. Looking at my MAL I'm shocked at how long this year has been. I've found a lot of my favorites this year, but it feels like forever since I've seen them. I couldn't even narrow it down to 5 because of how much top tier stuff I got to see.  **Top Seasonals of 2018**  Title | Score | Comment ----|-----|-----|------- Sora Yori| 9.5 | AotY. I need to rewatch this. 3-gatsu no Lion S2| 9| it's weird to put it in the seasonals since I watched the whole series in like April and don't think of it as a seasonal, but it fits. Akari is my wife. Violet Evergarden| 9| This wasn't super consistent, but the amazing episodes were enough to counter the meh ones for me. Hinamatsuri | 9| Heartwarming and hilarious. Anzu is my daughter. SSSS.Gridman | 9 | Pure fun. this is like a Saturday morning cartoon with a sprinkle of Evangelion and I loved it. Shinjo is my wife. Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight | 9 | While I enjoyed how much fun the over-the-top characters were, I wouldn't love it this much if it didn't have [one of the best OSTs I've ever heard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5aF-kURrwc) absolutely charming and magical.   **Top non-seasonals I completed in 2018 I can't narrow this down any further dammit:**  Title | Score | Comment ----|-----|-----|------- Clannad After Story| 10| Tomoya's growth in the early parts of the series was really inspiring to me as a guy reaching the end of school and nearing the working world. how the fuck has it not even been a year since I watched this? Evangelion | 9.5| Never before this series have I felt the need to spend hours on fan wikis after watching to read about the lore and theories. amazing experience. Koe no Katachi| 9.5 | Ishida is super relatable and I really respect it for being the rare story about a bully's growth rather than the bullied. The red x's over everyone's face is one of the best representations of social anxiety I've seen. Monogatari| 9| dunno how much of it I watched this year but the entire ride has been amazing and fun. All girls are best girl. FMA:B| 9| Really well-written story with a great world. I think this was the first time I gave a long-running anime a chance. Haikyuu| 9| I haven't found a show that gets me this excited in a long time. I'm planning to go to my uni's volleyball games once they start because of this. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure| 8.5| Parts 1 and 3 were 7-8/10 for me, but 2 and 4 are solid 9/10. Love the series, probably one of my favorite subreddit rewatches too.  My personal life's 2018 could have been a lot better, but my weeb life's 2018? one of the best yet.

Because usually being angry is a habitual reaction that releases endorphins.  You're basically addicted to feeling angry every so often.  When you are in that mood, you are craving the adrenaline rush that it brings, and driving fast just feels really great when your adrenaline is spiking.
If it's only a 4 mile (6.5km) commute, then your bike probably doesn't matter too much.  But there's nothing wrong with it. It's got space to mount proper mudguards, but no rack, so panniers are out. So if you get tired of carrying stuff in a backpack, your options are limited to a frame bag or large saddlebag.  I do a 20km (12.5miles) commute on a cyclocross bike and I love it. Basically a roadbike with slightly less agressive geometry - no need to get super aero when you're waiting on the lights anyway.
Let‚Äôs try:)

He‚Äôs anything but a nice guy lol.  I played him twice last year, once in WL qualifiers where I beat him 5-2 really easily playing with my regular team and later on another time in WL qualifiers where I was playing with a full bronze/silver squad in the 3rd round just to see how far I could go, against his almost full icon god squad and he beat me 5-3.   I got on his stream the second time I played him in around the 25th min, I skipped all replays and never celebrated while he shushed and dabbed on me every time he scored and was talking shit about me to his viewers on his stream non stop. AGAINS A FUCKING BRONZE/SILVER SQUAD.  He‚Äôs human garbage.

Get a part time job if you can.  When I was 16, I was a lifeguard. The pay is a little more than min wage because of the certification you need, which is not that expensive. And the work is not that hard. Be sure to pack your lunch too.  I would suggest a checking account for the money. You need funds for an emergency. Beg your aunts, uncles and grandparents for Roth IRA money. Swallow your pride - you won't get these funds if you don't ask.

So it‚Äôs okay to post something like this in food porn while it will get downvoted because it‚Äôs basically Chinese takeout however posting in shiityfoodporn and get told I‚Äôm doing it wrong?

Happy New Year everyone. I won't be shooting fire works tonight since I live in the middle of nowhere and I'm a killjoy that hates parties but I hope you all have a wonderful night. Party hard, party responsibly. :)
Yeah totally. She was naked I think in Homeland, though I don't remember the exact episode.
Hi. Sorry to hear about your situation. In the biz (of being a patient), we call this Juvenile Parkinson‚Äôs. Ultra rare. All of us who were diagnosed under 40 probably have that.   First things first. Join a support group. This one on Facebook is especially for younger people. https://m.facebook.com/groups/269825817156695  Know that you‚Äôre not alone.  There are things you can do to get a bit better. Somethings that will serve as a stopgap to help you get your life back on track. Things like DBS can be a miracle short of a cure.   Message me if you want more info or if you want to chat. Always up to help.
It took you a long time to come up with that.  You do realize that I'm just driving you further into your own misery, while not giving two fucks what you think of me.  HAPPY NEW YEARS!
A Coco ride seemed to be internally confirmed a few months back but they seem to have walked back. I would guess that once the ongoing France expansion is complete we will get a firm confirmation on if we can expect a Mary Poppins dark ride in the UK or a Coco update to Grand Fiesta tour first.

To be fair, the US fleet was limited to not using active sonar or helicopter reconnaissance, and didn't consider torpedo countermeasures. 
Fast as God will carry me. Seriously uptown to downtown via Claiborne or broad isn‚Äôt that bad 
Excuse me, that traditional "irish" fighting stance is from America and is designed to defend grappling.  These kings are ready for whatever bullshit wrestling/mma chad brings.
I‚Äôm sorry but I completely lost it at the filing cabinet part. Not only do I not know what kind of filing cabinet is screeching that aggressively, but just watching a man aggressively fiddling a filing cabinet as if this was a normal instrument to play...while the most awful Squidward-tier sounds come out. Lmao

We lost so many close games by a Td or less. Nothing was the same after the Steelers game to be honest. Still an entertaining season. I hope saints make some noise for our division in the playoffs

AT&amp;Ts Unlimited Plan is a pretty good plan for all of North America.   The catch is the primary use should be in the US and that it allows use in Canada and Mexico. They use to have a rule that more than 50% of your usage needs to be in the US. It looks like they removed that verbiage from the postpaid plans. However, it is a safe bet to say that if the benefit is abused and it costs AT&amp;T too much in off network international roaming, they will remove that benefit for your account or cancel your line.
Np :)
&gt;Are my views about veganism ethically correct, and facts-based?  I'm sorry, but philosophers, even modern ones, disagree on ethics on a very high level, meta-level. Your views about veganism might be "ethically correct" assuming XYZ ethical frameworks (for example,  deontological vs consequential), but it is trivial, although not intellectually interesting, for someone to simply assert that they don't think XYZ ethical framework is correct.
My Rule: Never unplug another EV unless the station reports that charging has stopped.  Mitigating circumstances. (This is no excuse for their behaviour.)  You were at 94% after 30 minutes? In a 2018 that means you plugged in at probably more than 85%. Even in my short-range 2015, I'd probably not plug in or at least put my "OK to unplug" sign on my dash. You really didn't need the charge, did you? Also, Nissan does not recommend routinely topping up when above 80%. You did not tell us what level of charging the other LEAF was at: 1st, 2nd or 3rd blinking light. I wouldn't feel bad about helping someone below 30% or 60%.   As for locking the plug, that is just rude. Once, 3 EVs were stuck waiting because some jerk locked the CCS plug to his Bolt. Another jerk in a Soul EV locked the only working L2 plug for over 7 hours!  I use an EV card that says, "Charge Needed".
Anyone know is there a girl with glasses or black girl with glasses sub? If so please link me

My best friend likes fashion, so show her violet from the final of season 8 was really all its takes to convince her to watch it with me. 
Also a good point.  Basically, if they're not already an Assist trophy, they shouldn't be ruled out.  Actually, even if they are assist trophies. Just make it so that if one of the fighters on the field is an assist trophy, that they're barred from coming out of an assist trophy if one is used.
&gt; her very subtly evil  The keyword here being "subtly". The whole point of her character in those games was that she was neutral evil, but actually somewhat regretted her deeds in the past and did not want Hakuno to think less of her because of it. In Extella she straight up turns into a bitch and basically disregards Hakuno's opinions on her actions, completely throwing that essential part of her characterization out the window.
They can, with the exception of revenue related bills. They must originate in the House. Then Senate however can do an end around by taking any house bill and amending it even if it has nothing to do with it's original intent.
Pro life vs pro choice is essentially appeal to emotions vs facts and science.   You cannot argue with people who say that aborting a bunch of cells is akin to killing a baby. You can give them all the facts in the world and they will throw in some emotional appeal. There isnt really a middle ground.  I absolutely respect people who are anti abortion choosing to have the baby which is also why I support social programs, to give children born in poverty a better chance at life.   But what I am vehemently against is politicians using this to garner votes considering abortion is legal and has been for 45 years.

No I upgraded from a Civic SI, but since I work at a dealer I get in all models of Tacoma‚Äôs all the time in trade.  I love the first and second gens but the price they go for is just ridiculous.  I just sold an 05 Access cab OFf Road V6 6speed with 130 k on it for 15k.  I absolutely loved that truck and it drove awesome but it‚Äôs 14 model years old and has a wholesale book of $7800 and retail of like $11k.  I think the 2nd gens are actually my favorite because I like the 4.0 and Transmissions better than the new 3.5 Atkinson cycle paired with the new tranny that has issues.  I definitely like the looks and the interior of the 3rd gen best, but from what I‚Äôve seen if I had to buy a Tacoma to last the next 20 years I‚Äôd buy a 15 DC OR.  The nice thing about my truck is it‚Äôs a special employee lease and I‚Äôll just get a new one every 3 years.  Absolutely love the Blazing Blue Metallic Color
He's a double Atlantean.
That‚Äôs awesome 
Thanks Becky!
Just tested it with 150 invisible bloons and when the ability ended, I cleared all bloons.   Flying Fortress got 424149   Pheonix lord got 380435  Did with with both permabrew and tsg buff
The movie was only ever released in Japanese, but you can still watch it will subtitles. Sorry I‚Äôm not sure where to watch it now, but I watched the whole thing years ago on one of those sketchy sites so I know it‚Äôs out there.  It‚Äôs nothing too amazing, but it‚Äôs very cute!  Edit: Found the movie, but unfortunately no subtitles. It‚Äôs out there somewhere! https://vimeo.com/154518189
Godly Monday. Most people hate Monday???!! 
My family used to make a cucumber dill sauce to go with salmon. It was mayo/sour cream/plain greek yogurt with dill and lemon, stirred in with finely diced cucumber. 
I think all the time about how I was so upset we went with this ‚Äúbum‚Äù and not Jarius Byrd. Cheers to not being GM‚Äôs!
By the way, this is fucking hilarious, as far as memes go.
I don't understand why we don't have this. It's automatic and bots can manage it. I don't even care about people miss flaring, most people won't and it would make the sub much more enjoyable.

Hey, I've got that same case!  That thing is a monster -- once I threw my back out trying to pick it up!  Anyway, I've been wondering if I could fit the Anniversary build (i.e. an EATX mother board) in there, so I was excited to see your post, then I realized you were using a standard ATX mobo.  I think I'm just going to give it a shot before wasting money on a new case.  By the by, is your demolition screwdriver mounted in your case somehow?
I think you are mistaken.  Are you sure you aren't thinking about the last season of House of Cards?
Yep. I actually thought it was a sticker at first. What a shitty design.

that‚Äôs always where it happens to, right near the end when you get the top 10 or 15 bonus, i usually have 5-6 kills and always set up to have a chance to win and then boom i crash it really sucks because i like this game and want it to succeed but it‚Äôs starting to turn me off like BO3 did post beta
