I don't think having them exist in a balanced state takes away from the game. I think if they're oppressively strong it does, certainly, as with any deck. Admittedly can be frustrating if they get the perfect lock, but I would contend that it's not any less frustrating when Mono Red gets the perfect curve for a turn 3/4 kill. I think it takes away from the game when you decide entire decktypes should never exist (which presently it seems like WotC feels that way about very heavy Blue Control decks, about Combo decks, about Prison decks...).
Real Gs move in silence, like lasagna
They kinda phased that out, right? Aside from the Julie Rowe types and your High Priest Group eccentric, is that idea impacting the average TSCC member in any meaningful way today? To me, this seems like a way TSCC is becoming less of a cult, not more of a cult.

Fellow Chinese kid who grew up in a their parents' typical Chinese restaurant hi5!   My parents have been in business for over 30 years and we've seen competition come and go. I'm interested to know how other mom and pop restaurants deal with competition. New ideas are always welcome :)   What do you guys do to stay relevant?   What do you do to retain and gain customers?
I think they've only officially stated bringing back the division. That would mean the title's likely to come back but I don't think they've outright said so.

I have this cookbook and have made a ton of recipes from it. It's good in some respects but not for beginner cooks. Saying "cook X until fragrant" or "cook until X smells delicious and flavors are combined" over and over isn't really a great guide for novice cooks. There isn't that much direction in terms of the actual cooking process in a lot of recipes. It also calls for a lot of super random ingredients that you can't even find at an Asian supermarket. It's a great cookbook, don't get me wrong. But it definitely has flaws. 
thanks a lot!!
As much as I like and respect Bernie, I'd rather have Biden than anyone else running.
I personally don't think it's a turn off. If I want to be with a guy it would be fun to teach him and explore new things with him. I think it would be hot if he was really eager to learn.   If you are worried about it don't just come out and say you are a virgin. It's not like every time I have sex with someone new I disclose the number of partners I've had. Wouldn't it be weird if you got in bed with a woman and she was like, "do you have a condom? And by the way you will make number 28 for me. Is that okay?"  
Yep, as much as I love her, you can really see how much of a "idgaf YOLO teenage girl she is".

Of course you can read it howsomever you wish, but I don't really love "diddle us". It doesn't seem to add much to the text. Also, I feel Joyce, though he is very self-critical, had a lot of respect for Dedalus as a symbol, and I don't think he would want to trivialize that. Father Conmee, on the other hand...
Mei is pretty good at being an annoyance while stopping the payload which is what defending in Overwatch is all about.  &gt;Her SHIFT freeze is a 'stall and wait to die' ability  I don't know why whenever someone makes an assessment of a character they assume it's a 1v6, if you're in a half decent team you should be fine unless you're against a McCree or Junkrat but this is obvious as they're the ones who counter Mei.

I get every limited skin because they're limited. Whether I like a god at the time or not typically doesn't matter. I don't like Sylvanus because I haven't played him, but I'd suck a lot of dick for his limited skin. Personally, I tend not to miss out because I know at SOME point I'll regret not getting the skin when I wanna play that god.  I think T5 skins should definitely be limited as a one time thing but all the other ones should just cost more, similar to the brief nature I've seen in DOTA ( fucking 35 dollar skins).

&gt;Putting out a dialogue is the first step. A problem has to be acknowledged to be solved.  That doesn't really mean much when the Democrats lack the political will to do what they say needs to be done. Again, they offer lip service and nothing more.  &gt;As for what the democrats have done, here is the main one. https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act  What have they done this millennium? What did they do when they had Congress and the White House? You may as well say the GOP is awesome on environmental issues because they created the EPA.  &gt;And there would be much more if any plans to prevent catastrophic damage to the planet went unmolested by Republicans.  Which plans did have the Democrats made during the Obama years and how have they been molested?  &gt;Not only have the Democrats done a lot for the Climate, but the only reason they haven't done more is that they are blocked every step of the way by climate change deniers.   Then I'm sure you'll have many recent examples of gas tax hikes and carbon taxes the Democrats tried to pass. Care to share them?  &gt;There is no way you have not heard of any of the programs and legislation used to slow down or stop damage to the environment.   You can't seem to name any recent ones.   &gt;And there is no way that you honestly think that Republicans and Democrats are doing the same for the environment.  Lip service doesn't do the environment any good.
What complicated ramifications and responsibilities of sex? If we're talking pregnancy, I believe they can be responsible enough, and I'm not sure if the "the sole reason children shouldn't have sex is their inability to use condoms" holds up well.  If we're talking about somehow sex fucking up their lives, well, I don't see how. Does feeling attached to someone fuck them up? Because they seem pretty happy being attached to their parents. Does sex make them go crazy or something and they need to be an adult to stand it? I don't think so, even if it makes them act weird it doesn't have to be a bad thing at all.

I just did a two month search earlier this year for a VOIP Provider for the nonprofit I work for that I handle all things IT related. There is so many providers out there, but its mostly dominated by the big names, Vonage, Nextiva, Grasshopper, Ring Central and a few others.  The current provider I'm using is a subsidiary of HostGator. There support has been pretty good and responsive, there features match up with what we need, and there price completely works for us considering we are non-profit. Now its not always great, we have dropped calls, we've had some small down-time, and there backend area isn't the best, but it is improving. For the time being though, especially considering the price, it's doing fine for us.  I am still looking for a better service out there, even thinking of going back to self hosting it ourselves, as we were before.
I've barely watched CSI/NCIS. I just compare it to the ones I used to watch in the 80s/90s.  I'll give you Omar, though. Omar was cool as shit. :D
They have a bookstore (giftshop) section in basically any temple/church/whatever the fuck they call it. So just look up the nearest one of those and you can pay a visit!  I went to a service once as research for a paper I wrote in college. I made a buddy come with me, because he was interested in the experience and we thought you might get kidnapped or some shit if you went alone lol.  The whole thing was eerie, but not nearly as bad as some may have you think it would be. There were not many people there, but all were very polite and sorta vaguely friendly. Went to the bookstore after the service, and the lady running it asked what we were looking for and we just said we were there for experiential research and she said "Okay, no problem, I'm here if you have any questions!"  I don't know what kind of experience OP had, but mine was basically just boring and a little strange.
I bought an Everlast 140ST, which does DC stick and DC TIG (so no aluminum) for about $300. I'm really happy with it. Sure, it's not big blue or red, but it's got a 5 year warranty and runs a nice smooth bead.  I'm going to take a class to learn TIG--I've heard it's the most frustrating thing you can imagine, so I want some help...
And then some.  I've ridden my dritbike home staring straight down at the centre line so I don't go off the road.  I was a dumb kid.

Ok, so let me break this down for you.   The cheesy nuggets from red rooster are an excellent deal... but they aren't that nice. You'll probably get a kiss. Maybe a hand shandy if the girl was super hungry before the nugs. I would offer a hand shandy if the guy got a side of hot chips too.   Never get tomato sauce as the dipping sauce. Go for something exotic like sweet and sour or plum bbq. This will show the lady you have appreciation for fine dining.   Macca's nugs will probably get you a blow job (with ball play) from most ladies.   If you want to go all the way (full blown sex) you must travel back in time and get the Hungry Jacks nuggets from like.... 2001.

I agree with the commenter who thinks it's a Madonna/Whore complex. Sounds like in your friend's head there are 'sluts who have sex with one night stands' and 'sweet girls who'd never have casual sex'. He's just learned that his friend, who he knows is a good and nice person and has therefore always put in category 2, has done a category 1 thing and is therefore, by his crazy logic, a slut.  Hopefully this'll be a wake up call for him that a woman's sexual choices don't determine whether they're a good person or not, but it's possible he'll just put this down as a mistake you need to apologise to him for.  I'd tell him how out of line he was with his response and keep this relationship frozen on your side too until he apologises to you properly (none of this "I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings but I was just so mad" bullshit). It sucks that he was willing to lose your friendship over some internalised misogynistic bullshit, but if that's the choice he wants, I wouldn't fight it.

&gt; know for a fact what is going on here  Nope I don't.  But I do know that depressive episodes are temporary in most chronically depressed people. Suicide is permanent, and even if of 10 people who tried to kill themselves if only 1 would regret it later, it'd be worth stopping them all to save them.

As a teenager, I had a lot of depressive episodes and fights with my mom. During one of them, she told me, "You're just wallowing in your own misery!"  For some odd reason, I decided that I wouldn't do that anymore just to show her up. Years later, I've gotten very good at realizing that I'm fuelling my own bad moods, and it helps incredibly much to take a step back and let it pass.

Same here. I just like walking around getting exercise and hanging out with friends. If I get to catch Pokemon along the way, then I'm totally fine with it. I wish there was a little more communication from Niantic, but at least the game works now lol. The 3 step bug is kind of annoying, but I live in a rural area, so I hardly ever see rare Pokemon to begin with.

You can prove it pretty easily by showing a screenshot of the payment, or your end of the ebay sale. Not terribly hard to fake, but would at least give you some legitimacy.

when these happen, I usually just say "sorry, the sandwiches come pre-assembled. I'm not certified as a food handler, so I'm afraid I can't take your sandwich apart for you, I can only cook it as is." because it's one thing to use tongs to take the egg off of a bacon gouda, but putting on gloves and picking at a chicken artichoke is something else entirely.

Well, we already held the record for second place finishes. I wonder how far off we are from holding the most 3-4 place finishes.   I would trade all that for one championship though.
Gun shows are mainly for people too lazy to go to their LGS or buy through FFLs (at a premium), people who want to buy/sell venison jerky, and very occasionally people who want to sell guns that they don't know the true value of.   The latter case is rare. If you're looking to buy accessories at a gun show, you're barking up the wrong tree. 
They should probably auto lock, like Hou Yi's mark so they don't miss.

The lack of communication is really whats hurting them. Based on the latest update I am under the impression the tracking system has been permanently removed.  For what its worth google refused to refund me. They said it was out of their window, and I had to contact the dev. They told me they have nothing to do with in-app purchases and basically see the dev.
Agreed, though the student will have irrational doubts.
I still think they remove the tracker so that either Nintendo and/or Niantic could sell a separate tracking device later on.  Nintendo definitely has plans for such a device. If the tracker works, the demand for such a device would not be too great.  
If its new and never worn itll break.  If its taken any damage at all it will not degrade.  So realistically its hard to die with it breaking since you start out in mage gear

Rangers are reportedly discussing trading Gallo for Lucroy. That would open up their DH spot. They've got a couple pitching prospects that mlb.com rank in the 60s.  That's the caliber of headliner I think is realistic.  I'd be pretty shocked if a deal doesn't happen. I don't buy the 'still competing this season' talk. They just traded 2 of their 5 best players and their 2 best players in the playoffs for prospects. 
The first elf to die was certainly some nameless dude who was a victim of Morgoth before Orome ever found them.  They were caring for Miriel's body; her soul went to Mandos.

Warcraft has an elegant solution to this, with the Peon unit. Essentially, the only orcs (in the first 2 games, things change with 3 and beyond obviously) that matter are the warriors. There are peons that handle things, but they are chattel slaves at best. There's a bit in one of the books about the formation of the horde of the beginnings of orc society stratifying, with the first peons being mentioned.  There's also the fan theory or LoTR. Volcanic soil is among the most fertile in the world. Where can you find a nice big, continuously active volcano? Mordor. The dreary bits you see behind the black gate are just the barracks and formation areas for Saurons army. The rest of Mordor, which is quite extensive if you look at the maps, is pretty much dedicated to agriculture and production to support the armies. After all, the Battle of Pelennor Fields, one of the biggest in the setting, only featured 100k orcs. A large army to be sure, but hardly the whole species.  For my own homebrew, part of setting it in an earlier time period than most was to explore the relationship between dwarves and elves before the popular racial hatred between the two. Mine were created together by the gods of good to counter evil, and part of that was having to work together. Elves produce the majority of the food, dwarves produce the metals and stonework and other such things needed for production. The two are meant to co-exist.
Exactly my train of thought!  Thanks for the input :) I guess we'll have to wait and see lol.

I think it only breaks if it's completely brand new (tradeable), so pretty much if you just died with it in your inventory it would break.   Otherwise, you just get it back from the lady at the dock in the same condition as it was when you died with it.
Yup. Notice how this wasn't an issue in 2012, when the GOP put an adult up for president?  We had debate/NFL conflicts, and neither nominee felt the need to whine about it or allege conspiracies. 
CS:GO would be interesting. Each time you die by a headshot take a drink... or something to that effect.  Minecraft has lots of potential and you can essentially pause it.

When I started transition I thought I wouldn't get mad if people misgendered me, obviously that changed as I went full time... but I'm not sure why I'm not mad when I get clocked. I'm guessing because it doesn't ever occur to me to try and be stealth. When someone asks if I'm transitioning, I'm truthful and say yeah, and I know that can end up bad for me in some situations, but idk... I'm a crass kid, so I can't find the time to get offended by others.

My man
* Insists their game is a fighting game when even their creator Sakurai called it a Battle Royal Platform Action Game. * Have you smelled them at a major? FGC has pretty low standards when it  comes to hygiene so you can imagine how bad it is when we even bitch about it. * Constantly bitches about first world entitlement problems on twitter like little bitches. Not enough set ups, not 3/5, prize pool too small wah wah wah wah.. lot of crying. * Melee autists thinks they were born on this Earth to play their game and thinks every other game is absolute shit compared to their party game. This isn't the usual "my game's better banter" but legit retarded smugness that they feel superior, when they're playing a basement game from 15 years ago. * Smash 4 autists all feel entitled to everything because they have the biggest numbers within their Smash group. Doesn't help when some of their most prominent players act like little bitches. Doesn't set a great example. * Molests cosplayers to the point TO's have to have them protected by security because apparently they don't understand it's not acceptable behavior. They even molested one of their own and pulled the "LUL was drunk jk jk" card. This was a sponsored prominent Smash player. * Hotel pool was closed 2 years in a row because a Smash kid shit in it. * Takes up more than half the streaming setups in any majors when they aren't even a fighting game reducing the number of games FGC fans really want to see while indie game never even gets a real shot of developing new fans. Oh and they bitch they aren't getting enough. * Constantly whines they aren't appreciated and threatens to leave and yet when we all tell them to GTFO they still want to cling to the majors because they try to cling to where the cool kids hang out. * Numbers have proven the majority of Smash players only play and watch Smash games unlike the FGC. Yet they're supposed to be "part" of the FGC somehow.
What's the point of us dropping signs though? "Drop this purple soap on the floor to make it known that you are insane and need a pummelling". Sounds defeating to the Mound-makers playstyle.

I totally agree, facing him is like a life event: it's the moment you really discover if you/your build is any good at all. The ultimate challenge.
You need to add constraints to the physics asset, like limit how much you can bend the arm, limit how the neck turns, etc.

Delete the threads, ban the trolls. If you really feel like transparency is super important, have a weekly thread that links to all the threads deleted that week so that people can check them out for themselves.  If someone is bad at communicating and has an unpopular opinion but legitimately wants to interact with people on this sub, then can modmail you and ask to be unbanned. Trolls won't bother.

I've used a buck 119 from the time my grandfather gifted me it during my first hunting trip almost 20 years ago now and as of 2 years ago started using a havalon paranta and don't think I'd ever go to a big knife again. Although I still use the 119 to skin my deer when I get home. 
Definitely NOT overrated.  Saban didn't even interview anyone when Kirby left, just told Pruitt to come on back. BTW, I think Kirby will be a stud at UGA for many years. Probably be Saban vs. Kirby or McElwain in the SECCG for a few more years.

not weird but when I was 8 I took a pillow because it was a long car ride. 4 hours later my dad asks where I got the pillow. I said the hotel. SOOOO we turn around and go return it, apparently they would have billed him for the pillow... I wonder it would have been more then the gas he burned.

I don't know if any of these were for GBA but it could be one of the Shiren the wanderer games. I think one of the them was for GBC. There's not too many games like this that I can think of.
Yeah. Less people out and about. 
Smoovie (http://www.smoovie.com/for-ipad/) looks interesting, I have ZERO experience with it though.
So the World Jump Rope Federation has a rulebook which I think is relevant http://worldjumprope.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2016-WJRF-Judging-Handbook-final.pdf  On page 4 it talks about speed counting, done by hand with a clicker and they base it off the jumpers' foot position.
Depends a lot on your tolerance to do boring reroll. It's common for people to get exhausted from rerolling and just quit. If you aren't aiming to be competitive, it's probably better to just enjoy the game at your own pace.  Isilla is a top tier GK so it's not as if your entire account is useless.
Any flaws on the unhs one?

&gt; Just because he's playing a good game means we have to like him?   No, you don't have to like someone, but extending not liking someone to actively hating them for playing the game is a bit petty and delusional.

False. Jaysh al Thuwar is there.   Not sure why it would matter anyway, though, or why it's worth mentioning at all. Especially given that it's not even true.
Your description of the game was a little tricky to understand. I only figured it out because I knew the game already. Maybe use shorter sentences? Obviously, long sentences can be great, but short sentences seem especially good for describing complex things.   But holy ****, do I really like the idea that you're getting at with this story. Those little moments of joy really create who we are. And it can be a great moment to watch someone else have a great moment. I think there's a lot more you could do with this idea though, if you wanted to. You could definitely put this idea into a larger story. But even if you never write again, you've certainly done something great here. Now this story is part of making me who I am today. Thanks for that.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).  This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*  Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:  **1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**  **2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**  **3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**  **4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**  **5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**  Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post.

Honestly I agree. If we as a sub want that open letter to be taken seriously we need to do better as a whole. This whole Trump reddit theme hurts the credibility of where it came from in the first place. Also this whole theme just screams troll sub. You don't have to make it season 1&amp;2 but you've got to make it serious. 
What is it with drivers of doorless jeeps resting their foot on the outside? I see it every time but I'm so confused 
1: It's by far the greatest battle in television history  2: The mountain of bodies is a combination of the point where the armies first smashed into each other and a little bit of suspension of disbelief. Yes it doesn't quite make sense. But so do a lot of things. The point is that it isn't too far fetched, made for a cool battle dynamic, and properly set up for the rest of the battle.  3: That's how a shield wall works. The spears are critical to the entire formation.  4: You can't blame the show for your belief in the R + L = J theory that was not put forth by the show nor was guaranteed to even be true. You went in confident on something you shouldn't have necessarily been confident about.  5: This show has already proven it is willing to kill it's main characters at inopportune times. So just because you didn't expect Jon Snow to die at that particular moment doesn't mean he couldn't have. This has lead to something I've seen in a lot of critics and fans alike who claimed they "knew Jon Snow was going to resurrect/not die at the Battle of The Bastards" when they actually had no clue. Was it possible? Sure. But it was also totally possible that he was going to die/stay dead. I didn't think something like the Red Wedding could happen but it did. So now people make a correct *prediction* and presume that means they knew something. When in reality it was a good guess.  You see this a lot in real-life. When people are offered two choices and they go with one only to regret it later and then say "I knew I should have gone with the other choice". Really you "*knew*"? I know the answer to 2 + 2 is 4. I don't say 5 because I *know* the answer. You had no idea what to choose or how it was going to end and are now mistaking your suspicions with knowledge. And then equating your false-knowledge with the show's predictability.
Wonky was my first impression... not being mean.. I think its your nose does not fit your face or the shape of it or something..  You got a banging body to be proud of for sure. Its just somethings off.

You may not be wrong, but if that's their logic, they misunderstand why people play Pokemon. It's not about catching as MANY as you can, it's about catching them ALL, and more specifically the best and rarest. Since lures and incense don't increase the frequency of rare spawns, the best way to get those is still - in theory - out in the world, either by finding a nest or by just covering a lot of ground and happening upon something good now and again. But without the ability to track anything nearby, your odds of stumbling across something are so much lower as to be not worthwhile for most players.  Edit: I English real good
that video is great.  and now all we get is "Cyyyyyyyyyyrilllllll"........
Well, the initial genophage was a combined effort from the Turians and Salarians who would of been able to spread it to many of the Krogan worlds, infecting a majority of the population. Any, non-infected Krogan would likely die-off due to either their warrior culture and/ or only being able to breed with infected Krogan. So you don't need to infect ALL just a fairly sizeable majority. Then Krogan culture would end up culling their own numbers over time. It has been, what, 1000 years since the Krogan Rebellions, right?  By the time of ME3 the only Krogan world is their homeworld, so most of their population is there. And all their females are definitely on the homeworld, so non-infected Krogan would of just died out without any heirs to continue the genophage.  *shrug* some logical leaps, but not necessarily space magic.

Generally, I find that picking either **boarding focused builds** (Mantis-heavy crew, crew teleporter, clone bay (new to you - system respawns dead crew members after a delay if online), breach missile weapons) or **weapons focused builds** (Burst Laser II/Flak I/Pike Beam are must-buys, other weapons should compliment each other - think recharge times, damage etc) has to be done fairly early on in sectors based on what options you have in shops. Supplementary systems that can be picked up for **any run** include cloaking, hacking and drone control (with 1x Defense I, 1x Combat 1 and 1x Anti-Drone imo).  If you have any more specific questions I'd be happy to help but I haven't played the normal edition, only advanced edition.  EDIT: missed a word

**Is there a light sensor mod?**  I'd like to have my space station lights come on automatically when the station is no longer in direct sunlight, but I can't find a sensor to do that thing.  I've searched and searched but I can't find it. Anyone?
Not a red tail, but a boa constrictor.  Judging by the absolutely tiny size and the pattern, most likely a dwarf locality.  Boa constrictors are commonly called red tails, but that is often reserved for *Boa constrictor*, previously *Boa constrictor constrictor*.  Honestly I don't like using red tail period, because it doesn't really describe what the snake is, just that it has a red tail.  Doesn't say what locality or what species.

&gt; What's even there to discuss at this point? Paper tossing techniques? How to spam faster to beat gyms?  !=   &gt; You asked what there was to discuss given all the glitches and problems.  Notice I don't mention glitches and problems, I just imply that the game is bare, as in, it lacks features or anything of depth to discuss.  But after I said in my first post (I'll quote it again so you don't get lost):   &gt; What's even there to discuss at this point? Paper tossing techniques? How to spam faster to beat gyms?  You replied with:  &gt; What would there be to discuss if these complaints weren't there? Is the three-step bug being fixed really going to launch a huge deluge of new discussion topics?  Its the same fucking question I asked. You seriously lack reading comprehension.  &gt; I hope you've enjoyed this recap of this conversation.  Ironic, given that you're the one totally missing the fucking point.

Really? I mean, I like Last Week Tonight as much as the next guy, but I'm not gonna pretend it's a much more than a humorous affirmation of, most, of my own political beliefs. That being said, I admit that I'm not acutely aware of Iraqi politics, so I don't know if this kind of humor is treated in an appreciably different way among people receptive of it.

I'm actually totally into that.  I'm not gay or anything.  I just love dudes that dress in drag, but are really chicks with dicks.
not quite -- even with the 3 step thing, you could still select a pokemon from the nearby list to track -- and then it would do the ping thing as you headed in the correct direction.  Or at least it seemed to work for me often enough!  So that is gone now, too.

This level include some hidden paths and even a whole hidden boss/bonus area. Main enemies: Cheep-cheeps, spike-tops, monty moles and "springs".  As always, feel free to share me your honest opinion and bookmark, I'll be playing your level too.
&gt;Next to 0 anti-cheat (I have personally tested fly hacking, and have heard many accounts of duping working)  &gt;After we quit, voa devs themselves claimed that our guild was a major contributing factor to the server dying, claiming that we duped (which we didn't).   So these accounts of duping were from non guild members? I find that very hard to believe.
Do clients only interract with business friend? Do they want to talk to you or the designer? Maybe at the beginning of the project one time and no need for that later? There is a lot of timezone difference.  Is your business friend mostly responsible for finding new clients? How does he do it? He joins events, builds a network of startups/alike who might need your consulting business, make clients happy, get the WOMM going? Is this the recipe? Or is there something else?  How do you integrate marketing into development and design? Or do you? What kind of marketing is it? Just setting up social media channels and some automatization? Or long term SEO and SEM?  Does your client regularly(daily, bi-daily etc.) interracts with your development process or at the beginning/end of agile sprints only?  How many hours of development *related* work do you usually do in 2 weeks?   Can you take up 2 or more projects at the same time and simultaneously continue working on them while their both sprint is ongoing?  Do your business friend usually need to fly to the US if the client is in the US? Or everything can be done online now, once you have some old happy clients vouching for you?  Btw I really appreciate helping me to discover more about consulting world and I'm sure many people here appreciate too

I usually don't like passing judgement till after a season's over. So far there haven't been any moments like Siro-A getting snubbed that have pissed me off beyond belief...though Lori making it to the semis made me come pretty close.
Spawn?
"if you need me, ill be in my lab"
Let's look at this objectively.  He's useless in tank mode he needs to be in sentry mode.  So he's utterly vulnerably until setup and then relies really on his team at least being competent.  He may be ok to hold the hill but not to assault it.   If your team is rolling them he could be super, likewise then if you're getting hammered it's likely he will just feed kills.  On reflection then he is probably inconsequential to the wins and possibly a factor in the losses.  I've played control point games where a a Bastion has been effective. My team and other team. He is a hero that has such dos capability he warrants respect. But that said Pharah and Genji are both fairly popular picks on control maps so I wouldnt be one to steam in with Bastion off hand. I'd expect to lose to both at least 50% of the time. 
What's the spawn number for this?
Okay thank you, if not I think I do
This. Is. Awesome. Don't be so harsh with yourself.  Keep studying other artists styles, not for comparison but for learning and inspiration.   You're in the right track: Don't try to look for the perfect results; instead try to sketch and doodle more and more and keep exploring unknown areas in your style. From time to time you'll like some new styles that can redefine your style and what you think of it. Moreover, in the short term you'll start applying *improvements* without even knowing you are doing it.  Focus in the practice and ignore the results. Just keep drawing.  Some time ago I watched a [video of Byron Howard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqV63qRFoUs) teaching how to draw Judy in his caricature style. Look for for [1:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqV63qRFoUs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=95) and you'll see how even Byron Howard says that another artist *is always right*. That blew up my head, and made me think that no matter how big, how famous you are, there will always be this other artist who you'll keep admiring.  So don't hold you back with your drawings and look other works for inspiration, not comparison.  I'd love to draw half as good as this work is.  Keep it up.

&gt; To those of you saying they are good because they kill people/act as population control  There is a legitimate argument to be had about that though.  Not just, "People should die, there's too many!"  But the fact that we keep artificially inflating Africa's population without any consideration as to what that will do to their society. We send free food which destroys the local agriculture industry, in turn making them more reliant on the free food.  This balloons the population without doing ANYTHING to increase their own ability to produce food.  Do you have any idea what would happen if we suddenly needed that surplus of food (which is literally why we make it, for national security and famine protection for first world nations) and stopped sending the aid?  Then we have doctors without borders and a bunch of other medical missions.  Most of which have nothing to do with training native doctors or establishing health care systems.  There's plenty more, and I'm no expert, it's just that there IS a legitimate argument that we should be doing different, longer lasting, things to help these people.  But we should certainly just kill all the malaria mosquitoes.  In this instance wiping them all out would only be beneficial, because it DOES actually help contribute to the locals ability to sustain themselves.  As people would have much more time to work instead of having to sit in their homes sweating out a malaria infection.  Work smarter, not harder.
&gt;I just feel like, because hell is infinite, only perfect certainty could alleviate my fear. And perfect certainty is simply not something that we can have in this mortal life.  I have perfect certainty that Jesus is Lord. I know that He is. I know that if I believe in, love, and obey Him He will prepare a room for me in the kingdom of God. I have no fear of hell.  Perfect certainty is something we can have in this life. I and many others have it. That is why we give up our lives for Christ and live by His teachings. Jesus doesn't want us to doubt. Why do you doubt brother?

I can't stress this enough ! I even hear it from people who never even stereotype. Fear poisons the mind.
When I was a kid, mom would buy everything I needed. The bags, the books, the tools. I didn't really have to go with mom because I didn't like going to the mall just to buy school related stuff haha :D I only wanted video games and toys :D As for clothes, well we've always worn uniforms at school so thankfully I didn't have to suffer through fashion shopping! :D After each schoolyear, mom would give away my books and notebooks to other kids.   During vacation time, I'd play video games and watch horror movies day and night because I had an agreement with mom and dad that I won't play games whenever it's active school time. My discipline was extreme, I actually did that from the beginning of elementary until the end of highschool lol! When I was in college, I just played whenever I wanted to.  College was different. Different professors, different books. I had to find whatever was needed myself. Sometimes I'd even buy other books through my own research just so I could learn more. There were certain things that I wanted to learn that weren't taught in my course (I studied computer science but I also wanted to learn 3d modeling, animation, and more in-depth game development).   Anyway, with how we can almost buy anything online nowadays, I think a lot of people don't even have to get their butts off the chair or bed anymore. Do people even need to buy books? When my second girlfriend was in college, I even hunted expensive books for her on the net so she could have them for free lol :) She saved hundreds or even thousands of dollars :D  I wonder how the younger people are taking notes nowadays. Do they bring laptops to school and just type notes in there? Are notebooks going to be obsolete soon? Do they even need to carry around giant heavy books when almost every published material has a digital version already? I wonder what it's like to be an elementary, highschool, and college kid again in modern times haha :D
Please don't jump to conclusions. You don't want to drive her away and you want to be someone that she can turn to if it does go as badly as you fear it will.

There are some instances of "double taxation" but for earned income that relates to "denied areas" -- countries like Cuba, traditionally specifically-excluded from FEIE. It applies to Social Security tax in countries without a Totalization Agreement when you work for a US company or are self-employed. And it applies to "legislative override" of tax treaties, specifically AMT and 3.8% Obamacare Tax. There are other anomalies: characterization and timing conflicts (thus: receipts of a hybrid entity perhaps (an LLC taxed as a corp in one country and ignored entity in the USA maybe) or taxed in different years with no credit) but these are rare. The most serious conflict is maybe wealth taxation (France, Switzerland...) in lieu of perhaps a higher rate of income tax: wealth tax is not creditable or deductible from US income tax although a foreign income tax would be.
Those 3rd party trackers were exploiting holes in the API and very likely were the CAUSE of some issues...
a man could say the same things she does and it would be just as unfunny.
That would make sense, except that a cornerstone of the leftist strategy is to manipulate those less fortunately-endowed races with the idea that all their problems are not really their fault, that it's just right-wing politicians and politics that are keeping them down and they just need to vote in socialist/leftist people and everything will be just fine.  They are constantly eroding the ethic of personal responsibility and trying to replace it with a dubious and lukewarm "social responsibility," which really just means "Vote Left or you're a Nazi, man."  Added to that, their electoral strategies are built around immigration policies that bring in millions of left-voting to their bloc.  You won't ever get the decentralization you are looking for, not with the deadly combination of mass immigration and leftist pandering.
How is it better?
It was probably said out of frustration, knowing Donna is at fault, but getting so sick of hearing how you are doing whatever it is that set her off that she begins to get angry with you.   The way you phrase it, sounds like it wasn't said to you and only to a third party. So, the context is completely missing. Your grandma might think you are purposely antagonising Donna and causing shit to punish her for being a raging, looney-tunes bitch.   I'm not condoning it, but just giving you a possible perspective of why she might say that. Donna probably hasn't raged as much about you as she is right now, so their opinion might be you are inflaming the situation.   But as you don't want to spend your life running a public relations campaign to undo damage Donna does, you have to accept people may say this when her whining becomes too much. 
how are the pmods selected? just curious.  wouldn't want to be one myself, doing free work? yeah right
The Features section is listed with the last three articles on almost every Last.fm page on the right side, and the link to it is on every page in the top navigation bar. Maybe the name isn't very self-explaining or rather misleading, so something like "Last.fm Music News" would be better.
Puoi fare ironia, ma è così: casabau è ancora lì. 
&gt; I don't want to learn a language that is written with weird and oftentimes otherwise non-existent characters  Although Esperanto does contain several non-traditional characters, many conlangs, such as the one I speak (Ido), does not.  &gt; Since its inception in the late 18th or 19th century, it has conquered an overall 2 million people?  There are many reasons why Esperanto has failed in gaining popular support, many of them political. But the biggest reason I've always believed is due to the failure of the Conlanger Community to unite behind one specific conlang and promote its use and development. Esperanto is the biggest, but there are *thousands upon thousands* more conlangs, and each one's community of course believes that their conlang alone should be the one the rest of the world adopts. The conlang community, although pretty friendly as a whole, is splintered beyond belief when it comes to the popular adoption by a government or other large body of a conlang as its official language. As an Idist, I'd be fairly hypocritical if I didn't take my fair share of the blame in this. The conlang I speak, Ido, was responsible for the initial split amongst what was at the time a fairly large and unified population of Esperanto speakers around the world. It undoubtedly set the conlang movement back quite a bit, as the Ido split destroyed the momentum the Esperanto movement had going at the time, which was significant.  **TL;DR** - Not all conlangs have goofy characters like Esperanto. And the failure of Esperanto and other conlangs to have any real impact doesn't have to do to any real problems within the languages themselves as much as it has to do with the mass splintering of the Conlanger community and the failure to unite behind a single conlang.

Yup. I've seen it first hand in the battlefield. No matter how hard you train some people just have difficult times handling the sheer stress and just don't know what to do. I think it boils down to us being so advanced but our instincts still operate at a basic level of fight or flee but in a situation where you can do neither "such as the woman not driving" what can you do other than suffer under the stress? Very few people I've seen first hand can operate under those conditions. I guess that's what makes some of us effective leaders and others not so.
When people misuse the words "sale" and "sell". For example when someone says, I have a car for sell. No you fucking moron it's for sale, not for sell. How hard is that to understand.

I'm not going to get into a deep economic discussion with you about this, but the fact of the matter is virtually every respected economist at this point in history thinks economic isolationism would be a fucking disaster. I also find it laughable that you complain about foreign workers, but are planning to vote for a man that openly hired foreign workers over Americans in his past business ventures, and even hired illegal immigrants.

Well I'll come out and be honest here.   I HAVE HAD TWO   One night I happened to wake up about 2:30 in the morning. It was one of those times where you snap completely awake (not groggy or anything). Since I had been sleeping my eyes were adjusted to the dark room. I sat there for about 30 seconds or so and glanced at the clock. Then I looked toward the door that led into he hallway. Standing there in the doorway was a large black Silhouette that took up most of the doorframe. The thing about it was that it was dark. I mean pitch black. Even though my eyes were adjusted to the room this was so dark I couldn't see through it. It moved to the foot of my bed, stayed there for a good 10 seconds, then it faded away.   The second time I experienced anything was a little while after the first. Maybe several months at least. In this instance I was dreaming and having a nightmare. In the nightmare was a voice that was speaking to me and it mentioned something like, "I'm here" and then I snapped awake and my entire set of bedsheets flew across the room.

I disagree.   First, you can choose to skip kill cams by pressing any button.  Second, watching kill cam can give you so much information about the enemy team. You can mainly watch to see how much ult charge they have, as well as spot their teleporter location.   I also don't think high ranked streamers have their kill cam off. Most of them just skip it most of the time.

Whats your relationship with furries?
Not controlling your data is the only issue with web software and it isn't that big of an issue. Web software providers are not in the business of loosing data or they would loose their business. If you are really worried, pick one who allows you to download all your data.  Uptime is the opposite to what your impression is. Running software locally, you might best be able to get 99% uptime, where most web software companies can provide 99.9% uptime - an 8 fold decrease in downtime (http://uptime.is/99), if they give you 99.99% uptime that is a 72 fold decrease.  Migration can be done via API or downloading your data (if its offered). Migration seems like a great idea until you realise the only company in the world that makes the software you need is the company you are using.  Updates like the ones you are talking about suck - removing features makes things difficult for customers.  Other benefits of cloud software:  * That web software you pay $5 per month to use, cost $10 million to write - where else in the world can you get prices like that?  * Updates for web software are given to everyone at once, you get them for free, there is never someone on a different version. * Never a worry about your operating system * Never have to carry your desktop around because its the only computer that has the software you need. You can work anywhere on any device * If your computer breaks just buy a new one because your software works on any device. * web companies spend huge amounts of money on security, the only security most businesses have is a modem with a firewall.

I remember once I was home alone, since my mom was one a date. And I was just sitting in my room, eating some snacks while watching YouTube videos when I felt like I was being watched. So I got up and went downstairs, and I saw a shadow-like figure start walking towards me, and I ran back upstairs, I went to my room, closed the door, and hoped that I wasn't going to die. Then I saw the same figure in my closet so I turned on the light in my closet, and just sat there in silence until my mom got home.

Construction is fun work with great pay when you're in your 20s, but you don't want to still be doing it into your 40s and 50s.
There are plenty of people who could give you great advice if you would give us more info, but your refusal to give us even an idea of what quality your school makes it impossible. 
Allegedly had a GA in a conversation with the DL where he was asked by the DL "How's it going with the B2G1 promotion, are you informing guests about it?"  To which he responded, "There are signs everywhere about it so not really..."

Hey, you need to see a professional. This is pretty clearly above the pay grade of amateurs on Reddit. I'm not intimately familiar with mental health services in Toronto, click here: http://toronto.cmha.ca/mental-health/find-help/mental-health-resources/  It will all work out in the end.   Also, I don't know what country you're from, but most military outfits won't want someone with severe mental illness and you should be able to get a deferment/other kind of service. 
I'd love to see a standard-compatible secret paladin list. I'm currently grinding my last 100 wins in wild with the old Secret Paladin list.
Thank you. So over all more people watched Hillary than Trump. They might have been Trump supporters watching her but she still had more people watch her. 
I'm 24 and most of my friends are apathetic. They say politics really doesn't effect their lives very much. Even if I agreed with that, it's still sort of entertaining especially the Republican presidential primaries. I don't understand the apathy.   1 is sort of politically aware, a business conservative that liked Kasich.  1 is very politically aware and supports Clinton  The others are vaguely liberal, they also liked Kasich. I've tried talking to them about politics, but they don't seem into it. 
Right but gravity also exists in Elder Scrolls. At what point do our laws of physics cease to apply in the Elder Scrolls universe. Friction, gravity, conservation of energy and momentum are applicable in the mundane realm. FUS RO DAH is Unrelenting Force, why not put that unrelenting force into a boulder and demolish an army?

Couldn't agree more. Given the cost and the scarcity of chaos stones, I really wished they would have pumped the breaks and introduced these at a slower clip. No need to rush these when some still don't have their 6*. My T2 Hulk did ok against Proxima, but his passive is hardly noticeable, and all the obelisks and iso sets help to make him slightly more viable, but still feels like polishing a turd. Hulk is my second favorite Marvel character, and I don't have high hopes for my favorite Daredevil's T2 at this rate. He'll probably get a lazy guaranteed dodge boost like Sin. Can't believe they sell T2 kits for 70$ USD for these lazy upgrades.

They haven't been untruthful about the game. They have been fairly clear, repeating themselves over and over again. They just didn't reveal it all up front and people came up with their own ideas of what would be there instead.  Then instead of adjusting their expectations on new information they would ignore it and use a single sentence from a 3 year old interview as 'proof' that their hyped up fantasies were real.

I only recently realized why "The No Seatbelt Song" was (probably) called that. (because the next song in the track listing talks about having no seatbelt, so it's a subtle jab at people who say "I like the no seatbelt song", when they're actually talking about Seventy Times Seven, and not "The No Seatbelt Song"). I haven't actually been on this sub long enough to see theories like this confirmed,  so if anyone could verify that would be great. I've only been a fan for a couple of years, but it was kind of funny to have that "A-Ha" moment.

Well I know it's not for everyone but I enjoy it. I know the trainers can get certification within a week, but all of my coaches with the exception of one, came from varying backgrounds of athleticism. The one who didn't have a rounded out background was an owner of the gym, she was previously a figure skater, and her workouts were heavy on the gymnastics, so I stopped going to her class in favor of one with more lifting. One who is a good friend of mine is into competitive powerlifting and does kickboxing and likes to try all kinds of things from rowing to cross country hiking. It takes a week to be certified but you won't be certified unless you're athletically competent. I've never heard any coaches at my gym tell people to work through an injury. It might depend on the gym, there's good and bad in every bunch. All Crossfit is, is a mix of cardio, gymnastics, and weightlifting. It can be easy to injure yourself if you have poor form and neglect your mobility, but that's why they have people do the fundamental courses.  What pisses me off is that he's saying he'll go, buying the monthly membership, then just not going, which is a huge waste of money! 
You could open it up to "every set printed since 8th edition" which would open up the commander sets, conspiracy, and some other supplemental product releases as places to introduce new cards to modern whether that's newly designed cards or a place for reprints from before 8th edition without affecting standard.

We shall see, we shall see ...  Hope is free but I think it's very unlikely.   The main mistale people do is to think Ep VII is a following to Ep VI and it's not really, it's a new start. The OT is there to pass the torch. Lucas sold his child for 4 billions and Disney wouldn't have pay it if they didn't have a whole business plan behind it and I'm not sure they want to follow Lucas steps. I think they want to create their own universe.

Welcome *salute*
/u/rideThe's suggestion is solid (as usual).   That avenger miniboom is pretty kickass, but if you're going to go that route, you'll want a c-stand or a combo stand.   That is a completely good option if you can afford it because those fuckers last forever. And frankly, once you start working with c-stands you'll use them for fucking everything.   It's mostly a question of the weight of the head and the beauty dish you're using and how much weight you need to counter balance that.   If it's relatively light weight, go with /u/rideThe's suggestion. If it's a little beefier, or you plan to work with more heavy duty stuff in the future then invest in a c/stand and that miniboom arm. 
The gains will be worth it
I would. Simply because of my morals. Just tell him the same story you wrote here. You saw Mary acting questionably and thought he should know.

I knew someone would adress my rank, was thinking about not even including it, but yeah, I've had a really easy time climbing the ranks so far, still learning the game gamesense-wise etc. but aim-wise I'm already in rank 70. And I know that our meta is not the same as the pro meta, but even in my own games, I've noticed that aside from the few times that you have the unorganised enemies, picking Defense heroes puts you at a huge disadvantage in the long run, the only place I've seen defense heroes picked pretty consistently is Sudden Death actually, Bastion, Junkrat, Torbjorn, even though Torbjorn sees alot of play to be honest. Outside of Sudden Death, they're often a burden to your team, I don't know if what I'm saying makes any sense, English isn't my first language and I'm just trying to speak my mind. lol
Yeah and so?  What difference would it make to his breaking the embargo?  Whether it was 9 am, 9 pm, or 12 midnight??  Eastern or Pacific?  He still broke all of those by tweeting DC is "0 for 5" and positivity for SS "will change".

I've been reading and collecting comics for 20 years. If you're looking for some great titles I'd be happy to list some of my favorites, that have amazing fan communities. All the fedora tippers really read is the super hero shit, so once you get outside that genre they're fish out of water. Getting out of the superhero genre is also the quickest way to shame them into realizing they actually know fuck all about any comic book characters that don't need a cape and a leotard to change the world.
Sure. I'll start with this one. See you in a week.
A lot of you are asking what Doopin mean but it originates from the [Little George Smith song, Oopin Doopin Doopin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S38rQii0UzM).   One time when he played in Philadelphia and whilst playing this song he threw his harmonica at the crowd and went crazy after they could not stop chanting 'Dale dale dale O'. Thus comes the term 'Doopin mental' as the crowd renacts this piece of history.
Holy shit.  I want to see it happen.
Unless they care about the players enough to implement these fixes, and in a timely manner, the game is essentially dead.  In this day and age, nobody has time to waste playing a broken app that won't even encourage the active participation it was supposed to.  It's like they took everything people liked about the original Gameboy games and threw it off the table into the trash.   Obviously they don't care about long-term income.  I refund my pokecoins when something breaks, it's their broken app's fault, not mine.
And it was ad lib-ed!
And it's certainly not the one who throws out 23% of baserunners

On-site security are... calling them "speedbumps" would be rude, but it shouldn't be a surprise that a shadowrunner team can beat them. It's only a problem if the rigger's drones outshine the street samurai in killing power.   That being said, there are ways. Tasers have a maximum range of 20 m, so if security can control the engagement area, the drones are in trouble. You can also give security better armour. Full body armour with a helmet and Nonconductivity 6 will go a long way towards stopping taser darts.   Alternatively, you can take an electronic approach. An HTR decker can be "on the scene" much sooner than physical HTR officers, making Data Spike attacks against the rigger's RCC. Local staff could deploy jammers, which at a sufficient level will disable the RCC. Without the RCC, the drones can only roll 8 dice to attack at best. 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkvLq0TYiwI), let me rub it in some more.
Why care about anything with that attitude? It's a stupid mindset to live your life with. You give your own life meaning. You get to exist, even though nothing else will someday you might as well enjoy it while you can.

This entire update confuses me.   Maybe when Valve's janitor finished coding Matchmaking, Jill thought to himself "Hey, this *looks* pretty good, maybe we should replace pubs with this, too!" And they then copy and pasted it over pubs and expected everyone to be totally fine with abandonment penalties and no auto balance on **Casual** mode; that or they expected everyone to be too distracted by the new taunts to care.  After finishing these new spaghetti gamemods, one of the unnamed TF2-focussed Valve employees went, "Oh, wait, we almost forgot to patch the weapons."  And during the patching process, Jill stumbled across /r/bisonmasterrace and thought "Hey, all these people LOVE the Bison, it must be OP" and went on to turn the Bison into a revolver that shoots slow moving pieces of cotton candy.  "Hey, do you think we should test out these new changes?" Another TF2 Valve employee said. Everyone on the development room had a good hearty laugh at the hilarious joke their co-worker had said.  During this enjoyable state of affairs, the rest of the TF2 team and the janitor were all trying to find out if they should buff Heavy or Pyro.  "Well, we can't do BOTH at the same time!" Said Jill, obviously.   "Eh fuck it let's just have the community decide for us." Said one employee. Upon saying this, said employee was promoted into the vice-president positon at Valve.  Jill then went to the comic makers held captive in the basement and said "MAKE A COMIC OR I'M NOT FEEDING YOU THIS MONTH."  When all was said and done, Valve presented the literal game changing update to B4nny, their husbando. Upon seeing that the filthy pub experience had been gassed out, he used his raging boner to type out how neato it was.  Valve was so happy that senpai noticed them, they decided no further """"""testing"""""" was needed, and shipped out the update.  However, that isn't where our story ends, as the big bad community was not happy. And Valve slowly but surely patched out some of the things the eeeeeevil community didn't like.   Jill, in the time of despair, had to say that the update didn't have the best launch, despite the fact that deep down inside, he knew this was the best update him and his team had ever made.  Somewhat satisfied, the evil, fun-hating community went back into it's dank cave that it called "Reddit" and shat on itself a bit.  After the amazing adventure he and his team had, Jill laid down, and took his well deserved rest...  TL;DR: butts
Dumbed down version: call buyers bet that the stock goes up. Put buyers bet that the stock goes down. If a person is right, they tend to win money. If the stock is unchanged of moves against him/her, they tend to lose. Decay can be a factor, so sometimes a pretty big move is needed. Like horse betting, a person can bet with good odds for a small payout, or take a flyer on long odds, with low probability of profit.  Most option buyers sell their contracts to close the position. Too many novices think about exercising, which almost never happens. The exception is when there is a significant dividend involved, or the options are not liquid (wide bid/ask spread).  Options are complicated. They are not for everyone. If a person is confused, perhaps study more, and if still confused, it might be best to avoid them. Those that need things dumbed down to 5-year old level, may not have the right mind set for options trading. Maybe 5% of stock market investors do much with options, and almost all the ones that I have met are pretty smart, and good with integer math. The dumb ones (the ones that have a 5-year old's intellect) tend to lose their money pretty quick.

I enjoy when things come together like this. It's never likely that this happens regularly for me, so it gives me a sense of joy. I understand that the Dharmma can be anything as long as it's something you are reading that teaches the ways of the buddha, but in terms of things like theNoble Eightfold Path, is there any place you should go for it. Such as an official book or whatever, or is it just the same in the sense that anything or anyone can teach you it?

I think it's because society in general has collectively decided that this selfishness is okay. Notice that your motivations are selfish as well -- you have chosen certain friends because they suit your needs. You aren't being altruistic here. That's not a criticism. You ignore others because they don't suit your needs. You are only considering yourself.  They are too, but in a different way. These other people have the need for social fulfillment, which they seek from you. This is no more or less selfish than your actions, but this specific selfishness has been collectively condoned for the betterment of people in general, under the assumption that most or all people will have the same desires. "You meet my social needs and I'll meet yours".   Given that this mode of selfishness is considered acceptable, your violation of the unspoken social rule is considered uncouth. One might consider it more selfish than their actions, as they are acting according to a rule which meets the social needs of most people, as opposed to only themselves. In your actions, you meet only your needs, not theirs. Of course, they can't meet your needs, though they don't know that. (I am not endorsing this opinion, only considering it)  All that said, I feel similarly disinterested. As a result, I tend to avoid social functions.

This is what I said:  &gt;That said, the argument that Sanders is more establishment than Hillary because "he's been in congress 25 years," is actually a reasonable thing for people to think, whether it's true or not.  I didn't say he wasn't anti-establishment, I said it is reasonable for some people to **think** he's more establishment than Hillary, given that he's been in congress for 25 years, **whether it's true or not.**  People seem to downvote anything they think even has a slight implication of negativity towards Sanders.

I'm curious on your stance on all those points.  My thoughts though:  All the mods really did to promote canwc was sticky the first thread and change some text for, like 2 weeks before changing it back. It could be argued that they also promoted it through the livestreams, but those were more for the canwc albums, which were a community project. Not promoting them would have had the people who made them angry.  This sub's humor, mostly. In case you haven't noticed, this sub is full of shitposts, so a comic with shitpost humor is pretty much made for this sub. However, it also has Rose, providing a level headed "straight man" for people who don't really like shitpost humor to relate to.   No. Rose's writing is solid and there's a good level of mystery hiding behind all the dumb bullshit. It also takes a lot of effort to make art this hilariously bad.  I don't think shitposters are really assholes 100% of the time, and even then the assholes are few and far between. Besides that, Homestuck's ironic since of humor attracts people who would be into canwc's even more ironic humor. And again, Rose provides a straight man for people who don't like shitpost humor.
Honestly, I loved this company. But the direction they're currently heading in is not one I can do. I've been with bad GameStop and great GameStop, personally they're heading back to the bad. I left about a month ago with 8 years invested, it was really hard to walk away. I still think this company can turn things around and when that happens I may reapply, because I still do love this industry and company.

VLC is designed for watching local files, so I'd assume that in all cases VLC simply presents itself as a HTTP/Media server which the Chromecast is instructed to connect to. This way VLC can convert anything that needs converting on-the-fly before serving it to the Chromecast, otherwise a large number of files wouldn't play on the Chromecast. Additionally, CORS and other security features could prevent the Chromecast from connecting to an external server, but if VLC can connnect it can just relay the stream to the Chromecast.

Well, think of it this way; We're getting STAR WARS movies that look amazing and have good stories on a super regular basis. We can't really complain. The reason they cut the EU from canon and made legends leaves them free to cherry pick the best stories (or fuse stories) and make more great movies. They obviously didn't cut it that way JUST to free up the saga films. Thrawn is already coming to Rebels and from the small snip we got it's the Thrawn from the books... not some shell of a character. I'll eat my computer before I believe that they don't have plans for the other heavy hitting Legends characters... Revan and Bane included.  Look what Marvel is doing vs DC; give SW time to lay out the long game instead of throwing these heavy hitters at us before they can give them the gravitas they deserve simply to shut us up.
This is a pretty fair explanation, but does miss out on its bigger downsides. Most notably, it's not particularly fun to watch sometimes, as games often end with a whimper. It can also feel discouraging to play as comebacks are extremely unlikely when the other team has already set a good time. Even if you play well, you're just running out the clock on your loss.   Time bank mostly solves these by having a more spirited back and forth and allowing overtime for more clutch comebacks to be possible. It's biggest problem is probably how long it can take, but I always liked longer games so meh. I'm definitely happy they are going with bank over stopwatch.

Bekijk het vanuit mijn perspectief.   Ik treedt hier op namens mezelf, en alleen namens mezelf. Ik trek aan de bel omdat er een probleem is vanuit MHoC dat mij, mijn model en mijn leden ernstig schaadt.    Op dit moment doet de campagne, het referendum en de uitkomst er niet toe. Alles wat er nu toe doet, is dat dit zieke gedrag stopt.   Vandaar: Zo zij het. Ik kom op ter bescherming van mijn team. Als dat betekent dat ik de campagne waar ik in-game voor werk schaad, dan moet dat maar. Dat is op dit moment ondergeschikt.   En ik hoop dat je het met me eens ben dat het voorop stellen van meta problemen _juist_ de mentaliteit is van een hoofdmoderator.
I think something stops being a single concept once "and" is added in. Thus, having human hands is a quality, but having human hands "and" having those hands be attached to other human hands is a quality plus a state of being.

You can test for all you like but dogs like pugs are inherently damaged. Or my two favorites, goldens and German shepherds... who get cancer and hip dysplasia respectively.   And finally... you're going to make the argument that artificially made traits are more difficult to control for than *genetic defects?* I mean goddamn! Yeah, a husky mix might need more exercise and a terrier mix might dig more holes than you planned for but you're going to argue that that is more of a deal-breaker than cancer, breathing defects, liver ailments, or heart failure?

Class effort. Teacher was moving back and forth between 2 classes while she let us simultaneously take the tests. Idk wala siyang time. But it's as if she was asking for it.  She's not really good at explaining things though. I could've read the book myself if she could give us enough time. So yung mga math (yes of course it's fucking math) wizkids lang nakakagets and they're in on it (out of mercy and compassion I guess) so we shut the curtains, ung mga naunang nakatapos na naging lookout.

We need to send humans to Mars... Why? Probes are much more efficient for exploration. We only need manned missions once we are ready to establish ourselves there.

It's certainly more reasonable on normal but again, all I ask is that if you're working on your lore that you still maintain an honest effort to help complete the mission.

Depending on which stats you trust, at least half of new businesses fail within the first 5 years. Last month Line was 5 years old, and Naver was 17 years old. Hae Jin Lee is worth a billion dollars, is 49 years old, and has a masters degree in computer science.   Personally I don't view this like the typical Silicon Valley startup that gets lucky with a popular social app, where everyone forgets about it by next year. The Line app is really just a portal for the Line Corp businesses to interface with millions of people.  I think Line Corp has an intriguing strategy, where they're not trying to build an empire on software alone. They are developing local businesses, that involve real world value, and bringing it all together using mobile software and internet technology.  I can't predict the future, but I want to hold some shares for years, because they seem to have a strong and serious business foundation, with big plans for the next 5 years, and a lucky position of being involved with two major internet portals.

The thing is TJ runs on a mentality that he proposed to others when people bitches about the whole #Showmethegums. "This is a game between us, you all are the spectators so shut the fuck up and spectate." Meaning that shit between AIU and another person(s) is between them and getting involved in shit that have nothing to do with you is what causes petty fucking drama that's a waste of time. There's a different between 'supporting' aka: Hello faggots, I am TJ and I supports this shit or simply being neutral because it's none of his business. Why should he simply isolate someone for some stupid bullshit? I mean for fuck sakes you guys are totally okay with TJ going to Brett hangout or inviting Brett in the show, but when it's someone else that's where it cross the line. If TJ wants to hang out with him then TJ does what TJ wants. He's not a hypocrite, he's not taking sides, and honestly all he did was to pick at AIU brain which is what skeptics does.

That's like saying, *"I'm an Atheist, so just before I die I'll burn all my money inside my house so that nothing is left for my family, it's not like they need it."* Just because you believe there's nothing after doesn't mean you believe that the whole world ceases to exist for everyone else once *you* die. Believe it or not, some people care about what happens to their family not out of some fear of eternal retribution from their spirits in the afterlife, but because they're nice people.

Thank you for sharing.  Is being pure consciousness a state? Is it something that comes and goes, or needs to be maintained?  An enlightened one does nothing, they simply know they're not the doer. The karma/action that is happening will continue to move as part of the dance of the cosmos. To the outside observer it will appear as though the enlightened one thinks, and acts, and says, and does. Within consciousness, thoughts, feelings, sensations will arise, but they belong to nobody.  Enlightenment isn't about what's arising in consciousness, but seeing the truth in it. It's a matter of clearing up false identification with the volitional entity. Once the truth is apperceived, then the false beliefs which have dominated consciousness burn up in the fires of truth.   Before you worry about stilling of mind, or anything else you've read about what enlightenment should feel like or be like, look in direct experience and recognize that there's nothing to attain and nowhere to get, because the truth is this, what is, right now.

So besides the actual pokemon and catching said pokemon in pokeballs, what else has the feel of the main series? Item usage perhaps, but that's in any rpg type game.   The way this game is built, some sort of indication as to where pokemon are is required. In the main games there was high grass to indicate an area where pokemon are. Specific pokemon locations are also somewhat indicated in the main games. (this pokemon on this route) so it's not like we were playing the main series catching pokemon completely bind like in GO now. Hell there were even shiny hunting techniques in the main games. You have to know which pokemon are where to pull that off for sure.

(Read this in the most sarcastic voice you can muster.) But don't you know there was that one guy who has spent 22 years in the church and has never encountered such shaming??? So obviously you must hav missed something.   Joking aside, leaving the church is brutal. I could only navigate the waters with a therapist because that's how messed up I was when trying to leave the church. Maybe read this in a real world context. The guy left the church something that may have been his entire world and lost his marriage as well. Those are two very hard experiences. Not to mention the isolation that follows.

I would add a black squadron crackshot.

Deltas are imho great if you combine them with an ace, but then you are down to two deltas + the ace.

My great grandfather was ninety-four, and literally on his death bed. I was around nine years old. He ushered me over and I got as close as I could in order to gather this last bit of wisdom he'd ever impart on me. He says, "Jacob... When you get older find the ugliest woman you can find and marry her. She'll cook for you, clean for you, and you'll never have to worry about her leaving you." I just nodded and thanked my papaw for the advice he decided to give my nine year old self.

And since she wasn't hacked when she was a government official, and she isn't currently a government official,  your comment implies that you believe she was hacked when she was SoS or that time travel is possible.   Otherwise,  Trump is asking that they hack a civilian to get a very specific set of emails.   A civilian whose emails were taken offline and deleted years ago.   On a computer that the FBI couldn't recover them from.   Which now sits in an evidence room in D.C.  Emails about yoga and birthday parties according to Clinton.   And nothing more.   And somehow Trump asking the Russians to invent time travel to get Clinton's yoga emails from 2013 is a national security issue. 
Haha yes. Nap town
I totally agree with you.
I like it.
Wish I'd known :(
Well I would be pretty upset about that as well! Your ex pretending you don't exist kind of invalidates your entire relationship, which is kind of the same as him saying he was lying every time he said he loved/liked you, which would probably really hurt to hear.  I think I would be *really* upset to hear that. And I can understand how your gut response would be to lash back out at the two of them, that would be my gut response too.  But the important thing is to realise that lashing out like that doesn't really fix the problem, does it? It's not going to make him stop saying what he's saying, it won't change anything, and to be honest it will actually just cement yourself into the 'crazy ex' position, which will probably make them even closer to each other.  He sounds like an asshole, and pretending you two didn't have anything is pretty gross.  I think you should start by apologising to the girl, and explain to her that your ex pretending you two didn't have anything at all really hurt you, and you took your anger out on her, which really wasn't very fair to her.  I think that's what I would do, at least.

If we're discussing the nuances of PG/VG balance, the topic is pointless without knowing what tanks/atty's people are using.

My 99 Contour was amazing. When I got it, I drove it 15k miles before changing the oil for the first time (dumb, I know) and it was perfectly fine. Sucker got 32 mpg and ran like a dream.   I probably could have put 300k miles on it if it hadn't hit a deer and the insurance company considered it totaled (only busted out a headlight and dented the hood, but, according to the adjuster, because my back seat was messy it wasn't worth repairing).
That was the funniest thing in that entire show.

Eh, I don't think most Basketball insiders and scouts are anywhere near as reactionary as this sub is. I agree with you on the literally everyone part, but I doubt people who have actual basketball knowledge (scouts, insiders) switch their opinions on prominent players weekly. Like I doubt most scouts would immediately forget the last 12 years of LeBrons career due to a few months. The reason why those people are in the positions they're in (scouts and GMs) is because they aren't reactionary, and they hold opinions of worth that they can defend.

Another friend of mine who flat-out told me she doesn't follow politics, told me I am wrong about Trump, to do more research, and that whatever sources I may have backing up what I say/think, are "wrong".
All I meant by "structured" was events that were slighty more than:  "Come by Camp So-and-so at noon for house music and mojitos"  And I'm also not against those types of events, as I still go to many of them.   Just sometimes I need some kind of activity or something.   While I've only played D&amp;D once, most my camp mates play role playing games, so I'll definitely be coming by.

I probably read too much into your comment. Sorry :(
Found the Democrat
I've got two, both from Pizza places.   First one, my Best friend and I went to this Pizza place right by his house. We go it to go and took it home. He used to live with his grandmother, so we offered her some. She grabbed a couple of slices, and we went back to playing Resident Evil 4.  A few seconds later we hear "Oh boys, come here for a minute. We go out and she holds up a slice of the pizza with long strands of blonde hair coming out of either side. When we went back to the store, they offered us another one (which we weren't really anxious about).  The other time was when I was camping with my brother near this little town in the middle of nowhere. There was only one pizza place in the whole town, so we decided to try it.   We got the pizza back to our campsite, and I don't know what my brother was thinking when he done this, but he looked underneath his slice and saw this black spec in the crust. When he peeled it back, he found a Fly baked in the crust.

I used a [Creative headset](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Blaster-Tactic-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0041OMWNY) for the longest time. I think it kind of sounded a bit low on the bass, and really low on the treble.  * **Preferred Music** - All genres of Asian pop music mainly, I also like the occasional musical number.  * **What would you like to improve on from your set-up** - I just want to get a nice pair of cans and a dac for listening to music and playing games.

If genitals don't matter, why can't they stick with other trans women? Sure, there will be some natal women that might be open to dating trans women, but those women don't need convincing. Most people don't need to be convinced to find something attractive, because attraction isn't something we can control. 
Riding (really riding, not just sitting passively atop a horse) actually requires some level of fitness. You need good core and leg strength to keep proper form, and if you're doing it for hours at a time, you need cardiovascular fitness too.

If he did things like you suggested then it he probably would be caught. 
This post is a week old. I'm flattered. Truly.  &gt;Except that it isn't a 5 star match...  Except it's an entirely subjective system for a fake sport in which the only real, objective measure is money. Meltzer isn't some infallible critic devoid of subjectivity or an axe against Hogan. What's his formula - feud+draw+workrate, right? Fine, the "workrate" sucks, but the other two factors are certainly there. So "LOL I raised it a -1*" from Meltzer is him being even more petty than he was then because now he has the benefit of historical context. The only people who care about rating systems and "workrates" are 1) fans who think matches with "flippy shit" but 0 crowd reaction are masterpieces; and 2) wrestlers who receive a favorable rating (until they receive a shitty one and then they bury Meltzer, who at the end of the day, is and always has been a nerd trying to hang with cooler kids).  &gt;I was 8 years old and didn't know shit about wrestling I thought it was boring.  And yet, an arena full of people, many of whom older than you and knew shit about wrestling, still popped at the end and cheered as Hogan did his routine. Because they were into it; WWE today would shit their pants in delight for a fraction of that. Again, look at RAW, everyone is sitting on their hands. It's the *event* fans cheer for today, not the match.  &gt;Nobody likes this match, it's not good.  Who's "nobody"? I'd rather watch that match from 30 years ago (and others) than matches today where it's painfully obvious the entire thing is choreographed, the commentary sucks, and nothing matters the next day.  &gt;This is why the feud blowoff with Steamboat and Savage from the very same show is much better remembered for its quality, and not solely for its place in history.  Ricky Steamboat: "Hulk and Andre drew the show, but Savage and Steamboat stole it." Some people like their chocolate chip cookies crispy, and some like them soft and chewy - but they're both versions of the gold standard of cookies.

I know, but that still doesn't explain [Delphi setting his scar off, especially since she was planning her Augerey schtick for so long that he should have felt her far sooner. And even if his mental "remains" of Voldemort were still around, why would she set them off in the first place? The Horcrux was there long before Delphi was born and Voldemort didn't love her, so you can't use "love" to explain it either. Unless you say a non-existent/ metaphorical Horcrux lets you track the owner's relations as well.](/spoiler)

*Up until the moment the portals opened Erin retained his usual demeanour however the second they appeared even before anyone had sensed them let alone confirmed their existence his demeanour changed to serious. At this point Erin quickly gave his squad orders and headed towards the nearest Arrancar. On his way he walked at a stern pace not flash stepping, or running simply walking.*  *As he drew closer to his opponent a regular hollow appeared in his path, attempting to stop him. To anyone watching all they would see is the captain of squad twelve walk past a hollow at the pace he was waking at, then shortly after Erin passed the hollow it died as in record speed Erin drew his Zanpakuto sliced it clean in half and sheathed it all in one smooth movement. He then continued on and approached the area where his opponent was waiting*
the assumption is not that dying is switched off but that it is very hard to die in order to extend the gameplay time of the demo or that dying wasn't balanced out yet, same with the trading of atlas stones. But then again you could be right. We just don't know at the moment. Nobody knows. This all is turning into a soap opera.
You don't. They released a game which was popular enough to be a worldwide phenomenon, then took out everything which made it worth being interested in again.
Yeah, I get that. I've been on the irrational side of that argument a few times but not once did I ever EXPECT to be given the forgiveness I asked for, nor hold it against the person I was asking if they declined.

 Putin isn't Hitler, we aren't Britain, this isn't 1930s Europe. So the analogy fails immediately.   But that aside, particular to Europe then, Hitler taking the Sudetenland did not make the start of WW2 more or less likely. It was going to start and the result was going to be much as it was regardless.   The Allies knew at that time that war was coming. They were, however, unprepared and wanted more time - particularly Britain.   But all that is irrelevant to the current question, which is radically different on the cost benefit spectrum. 
Haha no worries, I'm not judging you 
Seems fair. Just wanted to see if it was blink asking haha. Thank you.

I took seven foreign language classes throughout college, and there wasn't a single one where people used laptops in class. The classes were usually small (max 24 kids) and discussion focused since the whole goal is to be able to speak the language. We used the textbook every day in most of the classes (especially first year) and you could take notes in a notebook or just directly in the book/workbook.
I've heard that. So why do they make TTs like the LP-60? Rhetorical question but it's probably why I've never even thought of buying a cartridge from AT.

You don't need to use super-specific competitive strategies to win. Well, there are a few givens: you need to take Rationalism and Liberty is generally the better starting policy tree over Tradition in the mod (but both are viable). Ask to ban Rationalism in your game if you don't want it. Chances are your lobby will be willing to oblige, because Rationalism is very centralizing to the metagame. You could also ask to get Great Library banned, as well as Hubble if you don't like those wonders either.  Build scouts early-game, one if not two. Scouts get ruins for you, they discover other civilizations, they scout enemy lands, and do a lot of other things. Scouts are important; do not let them die easily or without a fight. On the same note, get a worker early by stealing one from a city-state or building one, preferably both. This will let you get your cities going much more quickly than usual.   Focus on expanding early and getting your cities out quickly. Your first settler should come before turn 20 if at all possible, and have 1 if not 2 cities settled by turn 25-30. Liberty empires should time their settlers with the double-production-on-settlers policy and Tradition empires should start once they're at 3-4 pop, 5 if you can make it there. Getting your expands out quickly will cement your position and prevent your opponents from taking your lands.   Check demographics often. Check army score: who's first army? Are they near you? How near? Is it likely they're going to war sometime soon? Think as if though you're in their shoes, and see whether or not you'd be a potential target to them early-game. Check science score: who's the science leader? are they close to you? how high is their lead? maybe you can stop them if you tech straight to crossbows right now? Asking questions like these is the way to start doing well; in a FFA, you have to be hyper-aware of your situation and always need a victory plan in mind.  That's just the atmosphere in a competitive community. Civ is no exception, unfortunately. You can ignore the "tryhards" who say you're bad because they're probably not very good either (good players don't talk smack about clueless players, good players ignore clueless players). Don't feel bad if you don't do well at first, because you're new and yes, it's very hard, civ is a hard game. I highly recommend you don't abandon the NQ community because it's pretty much the only multiplayer community for civ, competitive or otherwise. Watch FilthyRobot's videos: he's very good and watching will improve your game by leaps and bounds. But if you really aren't satisfied with it, you probably won't be finding another community to play multiplayer with, especially with the NQMod outside of the NQ community.

1. Ubuntu refers to all the different "flavors" of Ubuntu such as Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc. They are all official because they are all Ubuntu, just with different DEs. You can even [download them from the official Ubuntu site](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu-flavours). Unity is of course the flagship DE for Ubuntu.  2. The Amazon search issue was solely an issue with the Unity DE; it did not exist in any of the other flavors. I believe it was introduced in 12.10 and it has been included in every release since, but with 16.04 it has been turned into an opt-in rather than an opt-out "feature."  3. You would not have to avoid all Ubuntu related distros or even all Ubuntu flavors, since you can of course simply choose a different one or even uninstall Unity and replace it with something else if you downloaded vanilla Ubuntu with Unity as the pre-configured desktop environment. Distributions based on Ubuntu such as Mint did not and do not have the same privacy concerns vis-a-vis Amazon.

I really tried to give this episode the benefit of the doubt, but the part where the doctor of divinity (lol) was describing how she summoned down lightning into her sword was the point I physically said out loud "oh fuck off!". The rest of the show wasn't even "its so bad its good", it just sucked. When David was begging to be abducted while nothing happened and became so deluded that he couldn't even identify what was obviously a plane in the sky was hilarious. And the camera footage from the drone "malfunctioning" was so obviously fake and added post production. Its amazing how last week was such a good ep, and then its followed up by this trash! Gimme a break guys, what a load of shit! 
As bad as brazillians and pinoys.
&gt;Google Engineering Practicum, Facebook University Engineering, etc.  Pretty damn competitive. I got a "real" SDE Intern offer from one of those and I couldn't hear back when I applied freshman year. 
Considering that they are vicious as, probably not a good idea.

Yeah, I like sheep too but I wouldn't say I *love* them

We need a Hillary Clinton Death Count bot.  ##**TWO MORE BODIES**##
We don't know, but I have always thought that many old stone inscriptions are the work of children because of how uneven and strange many of them are.
Not thinking this is an actual reality, but Imagine a world where chiz and woody's roles reversed so to speak, chiz taylor and kyle with woody doing the tech stuff
Someone above posted an excerpt from an interview Mr. Trump did in which he says "His wife, if you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. "  Furthermore, I understand that Mrs. Clinton and Mr.Trump are running against one another, but it does seem like a cheap trick to try to excuse or ignore every Trump mistake or flaw by pointing out one of Hillary's (of which I will admit there are a good bunch to pick from).
It's your general when you drive it off the lot.   One time though I did swap a car for a customer when it died the 1st day, no way I would have talked the dealership into undoing the deal.  That died though, not "a light came on" , there are a few reasons the lights can come on without a serious problem.  So you have to let them check it out before you even ask for anything and you'll be asking for something out of good will not something you're legally entitled to.

In a normal election, absolutely, yes.  I disagreed with John McCain and Mitt Romney, but I sure as hell did not believe they would cause the end of the republic.  This is a unique election, the stakes are much higher.  There's a time and place to choose your battles, and it's not this year, sorry.

How about you stop being hostile, and explain what you were talking about then. Or read the other comments I posted replying to the other guy.
Not like Hillary. He'll never be a patrotic, honest and forthright citizen like Hillary is.
A cough syrup sold by my local pharmacy tastes like liquorice, delicious.
Even point blank is effective no-scope range. I self rezzed in trilas 1v3 killed 2 off the bat and a guy came up behind me and 1-shot me point blank through my overshield.
Yeah, don't have to tell me that:(
Good to hear about pvp/pve difference, thanks!

When I was a kid I was in the car with my dad, he pulled up in a village to run into the shops. I was nagging him to get me some sweets or chocolate or something and he, as usual, was refusing.  He came out a few mins later and handed me something through the window and said 'here you go!'. I didn't wait for him to come around the car and get into the drivers seat, I bit straight into this odd looking thing he had got for me.  It was fucking disgusting. He got in the car and looked in amazement as I sad there looking upset and confused with [dried cuttlefish](http://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mj-mxWYsDbkP2mLMBRs5Xsg.jpg) falling out of my mouth.  Turns out he had just gone into the pet shop to get it for our pet African Land Snails.

Not true, the bytecode gets executed on the jvm which gets JIT compiled down to native machine code. It is harder to code at a bare metal level on the JVM, but it is possible. Ensuring as few cache misses as possible makes a big difference. Java can at times be faster than C++, but the main issue with Java as a game programming language is the non deterministic aspect of its execution due to garbage collection.
Now you are just playing semantics. Just because it is an insult doesn't mean someone will get offended by it, but that doesn't mean that its not an insult.   Let me use a favorite of yours "let me google that for you"  Insult - a disrespectful or scornfully abusive remark or action.
Right on
EA takes huge dumps on consumers but at least has a few Community managers who chat chat sometimes. Posts like "Soon" etc
I have no idea what your trying to tell me
Seasons 1-4 are similar to the books.  The show is much shallower, but its basically a similar story. Seasons 5-6 are nothing like the books what so ever.  Its like they picked up another book instead and started adapting that book. Read the books, they are amazing.  Sure there are some characters who have similar names, but as of right now the book and the show don't have very much in common at all.

Nothing you said counters anything I've said. Debating Clinton will *only* hurt him, unless she just completely breaks down, which she won't. He, presumably, knows that.  What if he somehow knew that not debating Clinton would actually boost his popularity? Would it then be cowardly to avoid it?  He's vying to be the most powerful person on the planet (maybe the most powerful person *ever* on the planet). And you're saying he should do something harmful to his chances of obtaining that on principle. It doesn't make any sense.  If what you're doing is practical and makes sense for your longterm goals, it isn't cowardice. Cowardice is refusing to do what's best because you're scared, even though you know it's best.
Looks like you were the one getting pegged this time
Friend of mine is disabled and has a hard time making ends meet. She asked for help even when she really didn't want to. It is embarrassing for her. I donated the money anonymously or so I thought. We barely knew each other but I helped and didn't ask to be thanked. I started talking to her more and sending money anonymously still when she needed help. We became close and started dating. I asked her to marry me and we are about to get married and live together in a few months. She told me not to long ago that even though the money was donated anonymously to help her for buying food that she could still see where it was coming from. She thought it was amazing someone would help someone they barely knew. All she ever wanted was to be loved and cared about. Helping someone I barely knew has been the best thing that I ever choose to do. We're both happy and in a better spot in our lifes now.
For a while I thought that was just me.  Because of that, I don't even bother to use the Pokedex.
Yeah,  I spent the first 6 months of trials getting absolutely slain in trials, until I got a lucky card and team and was half carried by my lfg group. After I'd been once, it was easier to find good teams and I got there more often. The biggest thing that helped me improve my game is learning map control and communication, and how to be mobile and exploit  the other team's mistakes.   Individually,  I'mnot a fantastic player,  and my kd is still negative as a result of my how bad I was in year 1. But I play crucible regularly with friends I made though the game,  and as a team we work really well. If you can,  play with a crucible sherpa. It's not a guaranteed carry,  but they try to teach you good playing habits and how to think under pressure. Also add friends you can play crucible with regularly,  this makes it much more enjoyable, especially in trials. If you run with a regular team,  you can improve together and become more effective than your individual gun skill suggests.

Always in a good mood.  I largely eat when I'm unhappy, and begin in a good mood is such a great thing career-wise.
I'm starting to learn about abusive behavior and can certainly now recognize it in certain places of my upbringing, and even now with other relationships.  I'm starting to think that it's much more rampant that we realize.

What you perceive as me valuing reproduction is simply me seeing no point in life overall, and judging a human being based on it's function, which as a trend in nature seems to revolve around being able to reproduce.  &gt;That alone makes treating the brain rather than the body infeasible. Two, we are not close to that type of precision with neuroscience. We just aren't. That makes "fixing the brain" infeasible. I'll grant that it is technically possible to learn what's needed for "fixing the brain," it's something that's highly unlikely to happen any time soon to the point of talking about fixing a trans person's brain as a viable option is simply a waste of time.  Every time I said something like that I prefaced it with the fact that I'm well aware that it's not possible at this point in time which is why I'm willing to accept the idea of a transition.
I wish I could've seen this before July 7th, 2001. In many ways the military isn't worth it. I spent my first year as a Cavalry Scout sweeping helipad's in the middle of nowhere. Performing daily vehicle maintenance. Cleaning our motor pools. Ducking and dodging any officer that came into my general area. Going to so many gunnery's and being stuck as fire guard since I was a dismount. Then to be giving orders to Iraq in January 2003 and finally going over there and chasing so many bullshit ass claims of WMD's. Spending 12 months in that hell hole woke me up and changed every belief about our government/military. I cannot for the life of me go to sleep without Ambien, I don't like going near anyone or getting close. Every dream I have is about death and suffer from deep depression. Which led me to attempt suicide on numerous occasions. Was giving multiple prescriptions of antipsychotics. At the end of the day I did lose some good people, experienced hella bullshit, hurt a lot of people and took the lives of people of who I believe didn't deserve it. I will always suggest people to stay out of that shit because its all bullshit. I wish I was smart enough back then not to join.
