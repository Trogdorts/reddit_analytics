I have no idea what these places are other than the Mothlight, but I'll definitely check them out!
She was also one of the very first Federation ships built specifically as a warship (although officially it is an 'escort' so the Federation can still look touchy-feely)
The problem with Moffat was that it was shallow but overcomplicated. There were plots I can't imagine a child following that still managed to fall flat emotionally probably because they are riddled with plot holes).  You need a story that's simple enough to allow the kids to keep up while hitting deeper emotional notes. It's certainly possible. There are kids' cartoons that are great for the little ones but which have also made me cry buckets (I'm looking at you, Avatar: TLB and Steven Universe).
She's currently prepping for a post-WH turn on The Walking Dead.

Well, Peridot did say that the whole point of coming to Earth was to check on the Cluster, and she went to check on the fusion experiments, so they must be connected. His speculation sounds pretty reasonable to me.

Joke around. Call her out on stupid stuff she says. Punch her in the throat. 
I just got a job at a movie theater and my orientation is on Thursday. I also got a call for an interview at a grocery store and they want to schedule my interview Thursday and I'm worried the interview process will conflict with my theater job. I'd much, much rather work at the grocery store so I don't know if I should go for it or keep my theater job that is now a sure source of income.
WOw guess you're the fan boy after all ! :)
Don't use her e to harass.  If you do that you're liable to die.  Also, try not to use it in a team fight.  It's really a great escape or a great gap closer/for finishing someone off.  If you harass with it--you're probably going to die.  But--you should know e is also a great escape.  I.e. you can jump over walls or even position yourself between your enemy and safety and escape.  Look at this video of every wall jump:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA9dbjaXUo4&amp;feature=youtu.be  My only issue is that some walls are too thick . . ..  But probably the sexiest outplay I've done this season was against a Shyvana in the dragon pit.

Hey there! Im kind of new here too :) No worries. Ive been trying for years - went back and forth between the idea of surgery and finally just decided to do it on my own. I cut out sugars, starch, dairy, red meat, preservatives. I eat fish, chicken, fruits and vegetables and I haven't felt better in a long time. 26.5 pounds down this month. 
Release that shit !!!! Lost me a long while ago. 
People who take the time and money to come to showers and bring gifts - want to. They love you and your baby! Every single person at mine seemed so thrilled and happy for me! It was a reminder to me that We are not alone this!

&gt; I feel like you've forgotten everything we've talked about in this regards.  I'm kind of coming back to this a while from when I started so I may have forgotten something you said. Sorry, if that's the case.   I was just saying that it doesn't make sense to say they're 'drawn like kids', because a characters age isn't really able to be determined from how they're drawn.   &gt; Except the game takes place in a highschool, which you just said was context for them being teens. Which means a rational person would assume some of them are children.  I think it's reasonable to assume they're children until you are informed that they are not children. 
I know this isn't what you want to hear, and I completely understand where you're coming from, but I think you need to try to take it down a notch.  Three months in you're still learning the ins and outs of being a vegetarian. You're in this afterglow of the transitional period. You feel like you've finally become the person that you want to be, and you've discovered this truth about the world that other people could just see if they looked around.   You know that vegetarianism is the logical choice, and you know logical people that are eating meat, so naturally it seems easy to "convert" them. Convincing others to change their habits isn't easy, though. If gone about the wrong way you can push other people away. I think it's best for these conversations to come up organically. This pre-planned conversation could work, but I think that he should be the one that's bringing up the idea.  You obviously felt the direct approach was best, but I feel like your message could have been cut down to: "Hey Brian, when you asked about why I was a vegetarian the other day, I don't feel like I really explained it very well. I don't know if it's something that you're really interested in hearing more about, but if it is I'd be happy to answer any questions!"  Do you see how this is less focused on you (you said "I would like" in almost every sentence) and instead shifts the focus and some control to Brian? 
Ugh, yeah. Choke it down w/o complaining, and offer to cook the next meal. Maybe your dad will say 'my goodness OP, you're a great cook!' and you can cook together and teach him your ways.  Or maybe he won't and he'll keep on making his food how he's always made it and you can have cereal for dinner instead
Please make this happen

I'm out. Yeah, it definitely has trade value, but it's an investment you'd have to commit to. It's a rare Pepe, but it's just a Pepe. OP also depreciated the value exponentially by posting it here. It would've been much better used for private trading. I have a few connections with some high level Pepe dealers that would definitely be interested in purchasing a copy, but that's only if they already haven't received one. It's only been a few hours, so I'd buy now and sell quick.
I had that in high school, 3 in three years and 2 of them were major and incredibly scary. (One was bleeding on the brain the other lasted 7 weeks after the season ended) and I went through a really bad depression that I still fight occasionally. Since there was a definitive cause you should definitely go get it checked out as there's a better chance of it getting better when treated (more bad possibilities if it's of an unknown cause). I wouldn't hope my worst enemy had to go through that the feelings and head pain were so rough.

It's a tough call since the game could go a few ways that would make one of them worse than the other. [SSJ3 Goku](/agl) has a % based passive which is going to be much better in the future than flat attack boosts. However he also has a turn limit which with Bosses getting more and more health (Up to 10 health bars from the pictures) which means his damage could really fall off in longer fights.  Also odds would say that INT leader will mainly be an Extreme leader since we've already got 2 super types so Gohan won't be getting any buff.  I think I'd go with [SSJ3 Goku](/agl). Since you have [SSJ4 Vegeta](/agl) he'll be a decently hard hitter for the turns he has his passive. Even though he shares no ki links with anyone he'll still have FB for the extra attack at least.
&gt; No thx, I've got much more intelligible arguments to tackle.   Before you tackle them, you might want to learn what the word *intelligible* means.
Except Archdragon Peak as always. That area seems so peaceful and out of place compared to the rest of the world that is decaying.

Something similar happened to me. When i first started running i was really overweight and out of shape for a 16 year old. A super fit dude was running in the other direction and gave me a high five.

Ikr starting over is a better idea than building on top of a swamp. (metaphor of course) to get a grip on how shit it actually is, here's an article: [link]( http://www.pcgamer.com/heres-whats-happening-inside-fallout-3s-metro-train/)
I'm sure some intrepid soul will go in-depth on this piece, but for now, consider the following:  1. This is exposition. All of it. There is not a single scene, just the narrator going on (and on) about stuff that already happened. It's no different than some guy at a bar coming up to me and saying, "Hey, I'm real messed up. Lemme tell you, it all started with my mother..." Then the guy proceeds to tell his life story, and you just wish he would go away, because of reason number 2.  2. The story is boring. Boohoo, the guy's mom was an alcoholic. Boohoo, the guy's tried suicide a few times. "I am in eternal pain"? Gimme a break, dude. Go talk to a holocaust survivor.  3. Commas are not confetti. This is your second sentence: "Consistently, I’ve found, anguish, whether mental or physical, is a feeling that I’ve made great attempts to avoid." Terrible. What is the point of this construction? Concise language is the backbone of storytelling. Complex thoughts do not have to be expressed through complex syntax. Sentences like this are a surefire way to make editors and readers put the book down.  4. Profanity is also not confetti. The excessive swearing does not enhance the work. It comes off as edgy for the sake of edginess, especially next to the advanced vocabulary.  5. Later paragraphs are obnoxiously long. One paragraph is 336 words. In a small paperback, that's like a page of solid words. Major turn-off.  ***  Essentially, it's a blog post from a guy who *thinks* he's had a hard life. It's annoying to read, in both content and structure.

"I told you you were gay."  I don't subscribe to the idea that all homophobes are closet cases, but this guy was obvious to me in high school.

If advent strength increases inbetween starting the infiltration and actually launching the mission it can indeed change the baseline mission activity. There is no difference between Advent strength 3 'Extremely Light' baseline activity and Advent strength 1 'Extremely Light' baseline activity, but as Advent strength goes up baseline activity will typically rise as well. Baseline activity is not set in stone, if the advent strength changes then the current level of activity can change.
Throw waffles at it
I think the second team looks pretty decent, due to her AB recovery, uriel teams I think should capitalize on being able to move far more often than the opponent team and steal the ball back from the opponent whenever possible. I don't feel that ardor back will steal nearly as well as a light backline can.   MW and BI can be the 2 core stealers in the back if you go with such a setup, those 2 do really well for me atleast. You could still opt to keep mw up front and then just build BI and chitose to steal the ball and try to find someone else to replace MW, but that is up to you in the end.

It's a bit of thread atrophy.  Blizzard knows already.  Creating more posts about it (especially of the shit post variety) doesn't help anyone. And no one has an actual solution.  &gt; Que times for duos are still hitting 10 mins and there are more blizz responses to their esports website then improving the quality of matchmaking. Are we just fine with this for our game?  Correct.  You can help fix this problem by queuing as 3.  The entire problem is WAY too many duos and not enough trios AND the MMR loosening that happens for said duos.  No one is fine with it, but there is no easy solution.  For instance, what does your post actually add that other posts haven't already addressed?
Wasn't a big part of the Holocaust trials the fact that soldiers said 'i was just following orders' in response to sending millions to the gas chambers.

"One way glass" isn't really a thing. You basically have two options:  - Somewhat reflective glass and ensure it is darker on your side (not overly practical unless you enjoy sitting in the dark).  - Films and treatments that rely on conical perforations. These basically distort the vision from both sides, but generally such that you can kinda see better one way then the other (think of it as a bunch of mini peepholes).  No specific recommendations, I've only experience with a few such products, and they all mostly suck. Just google "privacy film" if you want to roll the dice.

They're using WotC's intellectual property without authorization and without making any changes that would characterize it as far use (satire, for example). It's not illegal as long as Wizards isn't complaining, since they, as the holders of the rights, have to pursue a case to shut it down, but they're in their legal rights to sue the creators if they want (and they would easily win the case if it reached a court).

Sounds like (Western) Oregon might be your kind of place.  A lot of people commute to Portland from Salem but there are many perfectly livable towns and cities nearer to Portland.

I don't particularly like this. I would rather map parking segments. Also, that part at the back can't really be called a parking. There is no service road going around.  Using relations everywhere is not a good practice because new mappers don't understand them and tend to break them. You are adding complexity with no apparent benefits.  Edit: looking around, I see you are at your "tile 100% of the earth" phase :) I was there too. You are connecting landuses to roads and tiling everything. Well, roads have width. If you connect landuses to roads, that means that the left lane is commercial, and the right lane is residential. None of these are correct because the road is landuse=highway. That tag is not used very much, but it's useful to look at it that way.

Durig the show, MC Kim Sung Joo commented, "I heard Chanhyuk is enlisting in the military after this album." Chanhyuk replied, "I've told my fans. I'm going to enlist after the end of this album [promotions]."    In response, Kim Sung Joo jokingly asked Suhyun, "Does this mean you'll be working with a new person now? Is there anyone in your company you would like to work with?" Suhyun answered, "Kang Dong Won-nim has come to our label. [I would like to work] with him." But then Suhyun added, "Akdong Musician will be Chanhyuk and Suhyun til the end. I'll be promoting by myself or in a unit."  *****  *I am a bot that transcribes allkpop articles.*

This change specifically does not, but it's the concept that I'd prefer to nip in the bud.  Assume this passes, then the hardcore supporters go off to red chins expecting no bots.  Maybe on day 1 they are gone.  Hooray!  Then a week later, it's like nothing happened.  Just as many bots.   Then these same folks are like "I know the trouble, Eagles Peak is too easy.  We need a harder quest like Monkey Madness or Grand Tree."  Then when that quest doesn't work to stop bots, maybe they need a medium diary too.  Eventually the requirements pile up and up and they do make a dent in bot numbers.  Then they will say "Hey we got chins covered but what about those blast furnace bots?  Let's put BF behind a hard diary too."  It's the concept that you must put up bot barriers to all good money making content in the game.  I don't agree with that.  Go down that road to the end, and new players are daunted at every turn.  New players are the only thing that will keep the game alive in the long run.
I haven't tried it, but I believe that you should be able to have everything set up in one domain, and add velocity values to the different "pillars" so that they shoot out in the desired direction, that's my assumption, but I don't know if you can change the direction of those. If you can get that to work you should turn off gravity in the domain forces, that way you don't have anything weird happening with the flames that are pointing downwards once the smoke slows down.
The pitch and tone of the "WHAT?" that just came out of my mouth had to be heard to be believed.  I'm actually really shocked. I thought she and Mafia were gonna use UPRS 3 to springboard a comeback and new fame for Wa$$up. That's honestly where things seemed like they were going. We were just talking #onhere about how she had recently said all her debts were paid off, and how that was probably fairly simple because Wa$$up MVs and production are not high budget. Everything pointed to us finally getting that comeback soon. I'm pretty hurt that she's decided to leave honestly. Wondering if they'll still do the comeback with 6 members or disband now...

&gt; I really do hope that he's heading for impeachment but it's worrying signs that he's intending on holding absolute power with his inner circle.  The USA has never been ruled without consent of the governed. This guy got elected through the usual process and if he does not bend in the wind of popular opinion we'll elect someone else in four years. You're telling me after a week you're concerned about him consolidating permanent power? Because all I see is a psyop to convince gullible people he needs to be taken out so we're not overly rambunctious when it occurs.
&gt; It's just been a really consistent feeling of wanting to be out, and then something tiny and stupid just setting his whole mood off. Like with the hike he'd forgotten his water bottle and it just ended up spiralling into this HUGE THING in his head that affected the rest of his day.  I think safewords would be a good idea for you two. The basic idea is that when you're out (or at home, or wherever) if he feels like things are getting out of control in his head he can use them to let you know discretely. You should have three- green (I'm doing fine) yellow (I need a break and probably a chat about what's going on in my head) and red (I need to get out of here asap). You can have more, like some people with both depression and anxiety or anger issues or whatever have two sets or some people have some for specific instances (like a trigger that has a different support plan to normal) but green, yellow, and red are the main ones you need to have.   A check phrase is also good for if you think you see him struggling.   Even if he says he won't go out, still have them in place. there may well be some instances where he can't avoid going out into the world and may need to use them.   &gt; he says he's been having a hard time starting projects, leave alone continuing and completing them  Mood journals can feel very awkward to start as well, but keep up a mantra of him being able to get to know his depression and learn ways he can predict it, control it, or in some cases (if he's lucky) even beat it off.

This is so pathetically true. I've been having a conversation on the Breitbart Facebook today with a Trump supporter who says my "lefty beliefs" are "easily identifiable," yet denies there's any solid evidence Dylann Roof was a right-wing extremist.   I was trying my best to point out the double standard in assigning blame to "the Left" whenever some foul-tempered person throws a punch at a protest, but not applying the same reasoning whenever a right-wing extremist does something awful. I was met with pure denial that there's any solid evidence anyone on the right has ever done anything awful.  (actual quotes)  Dylann Roof?   &gt;Please show me where in Roof's manifesto did he admit to SPECIFICALLY aligning with conservatism?  So I post the actual manifesto, which happened to be hosted on the NYT website:  &gt;Of course you citing NYT and Wikipedia tells me all I need to know about you.  Nevermind that it wasn't even an article, just a direct link to a copy of the manifesto.  When I pointed out a litany of other far-right extremists that have committed mass-shootings or murders in the name of their ideology, he insists that voter registration is the only way to know which way they lean on the political spectrum. Yet has no problem inferring that I'm a "lefty" based on my ideology, obviously without knowing what party I'm registered to vote as.

OnHub just isn't of much use to you here. It can be configured in bridge mode as an extra AP as you thought, but it's mostly wasted in that regard. It won't do a mesh in bridge mode either so again not useful even if you bought more unless you took out the R7000 altogether.   Flip it on ebay, sell it to someone here for a modest profit (because reddit friends!) but my best suggestion is this: if you have a parent or sibling or anyone with network troubles that always contacts you give it to them. It's a super simple router that shouldn't ever give them trouble and you can add yourself as a manager for helping check out things remotely.

How did you know
I'd say 'liberal' isn't equal to irrational; in fact, I'd argue proper liberal media can be in the eyes of the public as factual. However, what we need to realize is that the media isn't 'liberal'- it's creating the idea of the liberal establishment- and is really just pushing the corporate establishment for the Democratic party through the eyes of being fair and balanced.  Not that I would say anything related to the Democratic party at this point isn't corporate or non funded by private sector or countries.

We (married couple) have purchased many vibrators over the years, the we-vibe was probably the most disappointing purchase ever!  I can however recommend the Hitachi Magic Wand, there is truly nothing as good on the market, the new cordless version has four speeds and various modes.  It costs a bit more than other vibrators, but the truth is, it is worth every cent.  You really get what you pay for.  As far as dildos go, glass or stainless steel are great and the soft ones from Vixskin and Tantus are also pretty good, if you don´t buy stainless steel or glass, ensure that it is made of pure silicon and is phalate free, you don´t want to insert something with nasty chemicals inside your body... happy shopping ...
The dealer offers death sticks (let's just assume they're a generic drug). Obi-Wan uses a Jedi Mind Trick to tell the dealer he doesn't want to sell death sticks. Since the point of a Jedi mind trick is not to control someone, but to *influence* them, the dealer rescinds his offer and believes he no longer wants to sell Obi Wan the death sticks of his own free will. Obi Wan perceives that the dealer may still present a danger to others so he adds "you want to go home and rethink your life". The dealer repeats this automatically because of Obi Wan's influence, but he's confused because it's so against his normal kind of thinking that he has no idea why he would be saying that.

I would suggest a small router, plug the WAN port into the wired connection and the bridge/other devices into the LAN ports. Benefit would be likely much better wireless reception, more security if set up properly, and I'm sure several others.   This would also guarantee that you were on the same net as the bridge and theoretically the other folks wouldn't be able to access it.

Yes the SRX had the same issues. Jalopnik, back when they were a reputable source, actually had an SRX Turbo blow up on one of their journalists. The car needed at least 91 octane, but nowhere on the car said so, not even the sticker inside the fuel filler door, only in the owners manual. The journalist filled up with regular and a few hours later it blew up on the freeway. GM had really awful tuning for that engine. Any forced induction engine should be able to run regular gas perfectly fine as long as it is tuned correctly. The other turbo cars GM had at the time could run regular just fine.  That being said, the Cadillac has the nicer interior, hands down. Ive been in both, but driven the Cadillac. The Saab just doesn't do it for me. The huge plastic slab for a center stack, the 1980's green dot matirx displays, the weird leather. I can go on and on. My Aunt owns a 2010 SRX. I don't like crossovers much, but if I had a choice, I'd pick the Cadillac 100% of the time.

Are you trying to say that linking to the cutest subreddit that is actually the only one on this site containing relaxing and non violent/racist/sexist comments is sexist?   This was genuinely a nice link but redditors seem to see the devil everywhere now. After reading all the comments on this sub I personally go to /r/awww because it's the only subreddit that is worth watching if you don't want any controversies or stupid content.   But for dumb fucks redditors it's obviously sexist to even mention it. That's how fucked up this website community is.

How do they distinguish whether it's 'intentional' or not in this context? Seems like the burden of proof would be on the dead protestor, or the local DA (who presumably will not be too sympathetic to the protestors).  There was a Kurt Vonnegut story about a world ruled by automobiles where humans were just slaves to keep the cars running. Just a random thought, totally unrelated of course. 
You can't be fucking serious to drag trump into this discussion. What's wrong with you?  Look at the original post. I'm just shocked to see something that 100% is a positive for the state of the game to be met with this much negativity. You're allowed to be upset. Do it in another thread where is actually on topic. Or do whatever the fuck you want. But it sounds like you're trying to censor me more than anything.   Btw, politics doesn't belong here. Get the fuck over yourself.

In the years the Kings won the cup, they had a save percentage of 0.923 and 0.925.  That's above the average save percentage for goaltenders during those seasons - 0.914.  The Kings goal tending was above average.  Look at the save percentages for Stanley Cup winning teams (http://www.hockey-reference.com/awards/stanley.html). There's a clear trend of the save percentages getting better and exceeding the league average save percentage.  It just doesn't cut it anymore to have average goal tending.

At the end of my sophomore year of high school, my English Teacher (who was retiring after that year) gave me a compliment that I'll never forget. I had done some fun stuff in her class, including acting out self-adapted skits of Julius Caesar and argumentative essays and whatnot, and at the end of the year, she asked me for a hug and said, "You remind me of why I wanted to have children."   I didn't realize the importance of that at the time, but since graduating high school, she's really the only teacher I've kept in touch with.

6IV ALERT With Rain Dish
48?
I had been working with and training dogs for over twenty years, yet it wasn't until four years ago that I learned how to use an e-collar.  I won it in a raffle at a dog trial and being a positive trainer, was going to sell it right away.  However, the idea that we should actually learn how to use equipment instead of just read about it, seemed like a good one.  I went to a professional trainer, much like you, and learned how to use it.  I love it.  Ideally, it's not a punishment tool; it is taught with a combination of negative reinforcement and positive reinforcement (negative and positive has nothing to do with bad or good. In operant training, it has to do with adding and taking away). I have been using one ever since. I have also moved forward from simpe pet training and AKC obedience to more intense high drive sports like PSA, personal protection and do detection (exp. and narc, etc).  Aside from that, I have seen amazing results with aggressive dogs and with an e-collar, dogs can experience so much more freedom.
Hi, CrazyWebDev, please put the artist's name in the title next time or, if it's your own creation, flair it 'Self-submission'. Thank you.
well, I prefer using a 2/3/0/7/7/7/7/0 build. It can do a lot of damage while being able to take more damage than glass cannons and still goes fast (it's a darn hybrid.)

Phase Shift is great, but it's only as good as you are. You need to be able to predict player behavior to use it offensively, and you need to know how to be unpredictable to use it defensively.   But use whatever is most fun! That's the most important thing. 
Your friends sound like highschoolers
I agree. From personal experience, when people get cheated on, they begin to obsess over not being "enough." And it's worrisome - if you can do it with one person, you'll probably do it again. And they want to make sure it doesn't happen. It becomes a paranoia, and it consumes you. It's stressful. And what I've noticed is that cheaters then try to play up the hype, leave them in limbo, and make them feel less about themselves. If you had done x,y,z I wouldn't have...I feel bad for Javi. It's definitely all on Kail.
I'll only buy in powers of 2.

Hell I would sell it on eBay before I destroyed it honestly.  I suppose that makes me a proponent of electronics hate crime, but I feel like most people willing to buy these are hobbyists or kids who wouldn't actually use them on public devices.  Actually, I could foresee some school computers being destroyed with these guys.... oh well, $50 ya know.
Woosh
Take an AI costal city to make naval units. For the navy if you feel your gonna be out produced then focus subs to destroy embarked units. Your city's are not costal crept the one you took from an AI so sell that city back and then Germany needs land melee units to take your city's which are easy to kill in the water
O.O
This made me lol

Well, I've been playing this game for many years (Since early season 1) and I'm still playing it a ton. To me, the game is much more fun if you play with at least one friend, preferably more imo but it's also totally fine to play alone. At first the angle was a bit weird, and I honestly didn't like it too much myself but I got used to it and now it doesn't bother me at all. I think the game became popular becasue of the game being free and it was similar to WC3/SC etc, I honestly don't know. You can queue up for a game either solo or go as a group of 2-5. The game focuses heavly on team cooperation, skill and planning.   The games lasts from anywhere from 20 min to 45 min and sometimes even 70 min (This is qute rare though), and they are quite unique from each other, because it's all about which champion you play as and how you as a player/team decides to play the game. This is what makes it fun to me.  **How League of Legends works:**  *Client:*  You create an account which you lvl up from lvl 1, all the way up to lvl 30. At the start you'll have a few champions that are available for you. Each week a new group of champions will be available. You can unlock champions buy purchasing them with Influence Points (IP for short) or Riot Points (RP). IP is earned after every game, and there is a first win of the day bonus that grants you additional IP, which resets evey 21 hours. You can also go to the store in the client to purchase RP if you want to. You can use RP to customize your account/champion or buy boosts to reach lvl 30 faster.  You can play 3 (4) different game modes at any given time.   * **Game mode 1 - Summoners Rift (SR):** The main mode everyone plays. It's a 5v5 mode with 3 lanes, 2 NPC "bosses" and jungle monsters. * **Game mode 2 - All Random All Mid (ARAM):** This game mode is designed to give you a random champion to fight with in one "lane".  * **Game mode 3 - Twisted Treeline (TT):** It's a 3v3 mode with with 2 lanes, 1 NPC "boss" and jungle monsters. * **(Game mode 4) - Ranked:** Requires you to have lvled up your account to lvl 30, and own (have purchased 16 champions). Can be played on SR and TT, either as solo or with friends. The only difference is that the games is rating you, and in the end of the season giving you a reward for how good you did. * **Rotating game modes:** Are game modes that changes from time to time, with different objectives from the standard modes mentioned above.  [Here is a quick look of what my profile looks like.](https://gyazo.com/a9b04129703c5864a7f2a723ed253569.jpg)  **In the game itself:**   You have selected a champion you want to play. You lvl up from lvl 1-18. You buy items with gold to make your champion stronger. You earn gold and experience buy killing minions and other enemy champions. You win the game buy fighting your way into the other team's base and destroying their "Nexus". [Video of how to play the game.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGtROJeMPeE)  **My personal pros and cons about this game:**  *Pros:*  * The game is free to play. * I have had *TONS* of laughs with this game. * It can be really fun when you do something cool, or get that clutch win. * It's not a pay to win game. You can only buy yourself a boost to reach up to max lvl  * The game can really satisfy you if your're a competetive person. I mean who doesn't like winning? * It is totally up to you if you want to spend money on this game or not. * You can give and recieve gifts (Champions, skins, icons etc). * You can meet a lot of cool people in this game. * Riot made it possible to get champions and skins for free. (Skins could only be purchased with real money. * Items, Runes and mastery point system - allows you to play a champion in multiple ways.  *Cons*  * It's really easy to be tempted to buy stuff.  * Some players are not so friendly during games. * When you start a game, you better have at least 1 hour to play. If you leave during a game, you will eventually get punished by it. * It can be really frustrating to play as 4v5 due to a person leaving the game/disconnects. * Small amounts of IP earned after each game, which again makes it a grind to get the perfect runes. * Addicting.  **TL;DR:** I would absolutely give the game a try. Because you don't have played any MOBA's before - You'd might just like it once you get the hang of it! And the best part, it's *FREE*, so if you don't like it, you can just uninstall the game and you would still not have lost anything!  Feel free to ask questions if there are any. :)  EDIT: A word.
There is no goldar pop. 
Thanks! When I'm back to my computer I'll grab a version without, it wasn't a heavy lens vingette but the OP has kinda just exasabated it.
The main thing I see this affecting are older games that were released and never really updated. I can't think of a productivity app that isn't already 64bit that I use.
Sure. This is something myself, and people like Colin Moriarty, Jim Sterling, etc., have all just concocted in our heads. 
Snu snu?
Lol I'm glad everyone read this as "I don't like chaos which is what B is made for" 
yes buy it haha
Holy heck, I thought I was darned. Thanks for saving my life (50 mins of editing). Take your upvotes
Honestly, this won't do a thing. But it's good to see people opposing. You can only hope these leaders listen at all.
Meh....we had "Steal the Bacon".   Place a chalkboard eraser (the bacon) in the middle of a field.   Separate the children into 2 perpendicular lines.   Number the kids.   Call the number and 2 kids run full speed at one another to be the first to get the bacon.   Lots of head on collisions.   Then there was Clothesline, I mean Red Rover....

I'd say FO Stafford early in the year. To this point he has been the player who held a spot on my team the longest. He was my favorite because I love to cheese the deep ball on solos lol
Maybe a week after the game came out.
Probably because your hand moves around too much, making it hard for staples stay in. Maybe? Can anyone confirm?
If you look through history, stealing is just part of the process of maturing the country's economy to global standards.

Yes, the voters fucked up, but it's hard to hold 130 million people accountable. The Dems were given every opportunity to win and tried to force a candidate. This split their base nearly in half, and put the only person in the US that couldn't beat Trump up against him.   Also, I do blame the Republicans (the party moreso than the voters), but how do you convince a party that's unmoved by facts of anything but their own beliefs? They used to be the common sense spending party, but they've allowed themselves to be taken over by sensationalism, bigots, and money. The Demss best option is to look inward, find their own flaws, and either figure out how to reform themselves to renew the public's trust, or play dirty. The only other option is a pathetic half-measure of sitting on the floor pouting while the Grand Ole Party runs the country back into the ground. 
hes trying hard to not jinx himself
That is true friendship right there :').
Frigging cool? They left out more then half of the game to begin with.... not cool ;)
no matter how many times I read the title, I kept reading CheapSkate.

Truthfully, they have better coffee than Starbucks. Would say this before all this went down.
Hey, thanks for your concern! We don't really have an answer yet, as it is currently under investigation. However it has been an exceptionally hot year.   Most people in my bubble seem to think that it is a terrorist attempt from some of the *Mapuche* people to emancipate. No hard evidence yet.  Some people seem to think that it's the Forestry moguls, now that the TPP is in the crapper, they wont be able to sell their timber. They'd be after the insurance money. This seems unlikely, considering how hard it is to insure the Forestal industry (or how expensive are the premium fees).   There are even more far fetched theories. President Bachelet has taken her time to investigate and take action ([most of Chile seems to think so](http://www.latercera.com/noticia/bachelet-llega-mayor-nivel-desaprobacion-medio-catastrofe-incendios/))  Whatever the reason, the situation is dire. I really hope that these fires are not manmade. Right now I can't bear to think otherwise. 
Keep it up! Congrats on your sobriety!
So they would beat the 2017 Western Conference All Star team? Because that's basically what they're going up against.
&gt;(b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, **provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality.** Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritizatio  I mean, (1) it's literally discriminating based on religion, and (2)  even if you disagree, it's got a discriminatory effect and the dumbass-in-chief has put plenty out to infer a discriminatory purpose. Pick your poison. 
&gt; Having said all that, I totally support price transparency in healthcare. However, in our current system, the onus for that should fall on the insurance companies, not on the healthcare providers.  So would having an itemized list (in the way SCO does) for every procedure, drug, PT, type of room, etc... would that be something that the insurance should list out their prices for? Something like that?  I will be going to medical school myself so I'm really attempting to figure this out for the long run when I start a practice as I really want to make it as streamlined and easy to understand for a patient as well as making the quality top-notch. There seem to be too many answers to choose from for that.
&gt; unless we are denied by a set of laws set up by an authoritarian administration that keeps us from seeing our families from certain parts of the world.  Ask the ones setting up laws.
If it means keeping Unions out of an industry like programming, I'm happy to be a crab. The Union system is corrupt and a broken mess. A ponzi scheme meant to take money from its forced labor.  No, Programming needs a Guild to enforce a basic level of competence and compliance with regulations.

Really? Turko hatress has blinded your eyes mate.  Literally from wikipedia. ( you know a few mins of googling /u/Chromeine)  The Qing dynasty conquered Moghulistan in the 18th century.[35] It invaded Dzungaria in 1759 and dominated it until 1864. The territory was renamed Xinjiang, soon after the Qing invasion of the Dzungars. "Historians estimate that a million people were slaughtered, and the land so devastated that it took a generation for it to recover."[36] During this period, the Uyghurs revolted 42 times against Qing Dynasty rulers.  So it was the Qing dynasty(chinese) that conquered the area from tribes and as soon as they did they slaughtered 1 million natives and completely destroyed the environment.   So what are you even talking about? Stabbing Chinese civilians? Blegh!
What concept? A show or movie about people with powers running around saving people? Nah, nothing like that will ever get off the ground successfully.

In a perfect world, I would say fix.  I think the big issue are loopholes like my example, where NAFTA is not working as intended.  Unless there is some gaping economic disadvantage we're at by keeping a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, I see no need to dismantle it - but loophole like that, which are costing us $100s of millions in revenue on duty/taxes, absolutely need to be amended.

Nope! Very much a Brit here!
This is an insane idea. It would require millions of people to be displaced from their homes in order to solve a conflict that, somehow, you've managed to convince yourself is large enough to actually be a problem worth dedicating massive resources to solving.
&gt;utopian socialism  A term marxists use to refer to any socialism that isn't founded on a scientific basis (as marxism purports to do).  &gt;anarchism  Anti-statist socialism, to oversimplify it completely.   &gt;autonomist marxist  A loose umbrella term referring to movements that take influence from marxism, anarchism and post-modernism, again to disgustingly oversimplify.

Because America has fallen victim to a movement to celebrate mediocrity.  We give out prizes to everyone, because everyone's child is a unique, special duckin snowflake.  Look at no child left behindesque laws.  Every law that essentially rewards a person for absolutely no tangible action of their own contributes to this problem.  Nobody, not a single perso, is OWED a god damn thing in this world.  Everything is earned, yet we now have a new definition of what it is to earn something.  We should all be millionnaires by default because we are all victims of something, right?

Okay thanks 
Gee, I wonder if they warned Mr. Money Mustache that they were about to screw his fanbase ahead of time. 
The real threat to the NBN is 5G mobile.  With FTTP, it's cheap and easy to upgrade and offer gigabit or 10 gigabit connections in the future. FTTN can't really be upgraded, so it'll never go faster. This makes it much more difficult for the NBN to stay relevant as technology moves forward.  The NBN's low speeds and high prices mean it faces competition from next gen mobile, which is kind of pathetic for a wired network.
Well, depends. Solo, Prestina. Colo most cases, Sylunis, against certain heroes use certain goddesses. I'm unsure by what you mean how should I do it.

Where is the requirement that says you must buy into an early access game? You can wait like the rest of the people who don't want to buy in. But slamming an EA game for being in EA is idiotic.  &gt; 10 years ago there was no early access, devs/game testers can fix stuff too.  Times change.

Shame on him for contributing to the conversation
&gt;People's worth/character traits have nothing to do with how many partners they have had.  Eh not sure I agree.  I agree we shouldn't' shame one for what their sexual history is or lack thereof.  But one's sexual history or lack thereof does tell us something about the person tho.  As say you have someone in their early 30's who had bunch of sex in their early 20's but now they barely have one partner a year.  That to me says they grew up and got more mature/serious with life for example.  Where as if the same 30 year old is still sleeping around a lot that tells me they are well a slut and want to always have fun.   Should either one be shamed?  No.  But their sexual history does tell us something about the person tho.
So 4? :P 
Public schools are by design socialist (not using that term in a negative or positive way, just plain). Richer people generally pay in more and poorer people less. There's nothing special about illegal immigrants here, other than that they probably tend to earn and own less than average in most communities.

Yeah I heard tracking is a pretty big issue/difference. I was kinda hoping that maybe I could get away with buying the Guitar version and pass it off for both, but I went and tried it today and it didn't work so well on the bass.  I know it's excessive, but I'll likely end up buying both. Starting with the Bass version, of course.  Thanks for the info on the modding- I'll look that up just out of curiosity.

They're even on the kids channel for youtube; so yeah... For anyone who would prefer not to have their kids see these, i'd suggest using a youtube [video blocker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-blocker/jknkjnpcbbgcbdbaampbjlhkcghmgfhk?hl=en) extension and adding the channels you want to ban. (I already use it myself for certain annoying channels, so they don't get suggested.)  No clue how to do it for the youtube app on tablets atm though.

I was in gym class and we had to balance ourself on a line and I had some difficulty. A girl (to whom I had always a dick to, if I'm being honest) told me to just focus on one point in the distance and that it would work. I did and it worked. Once I was done, she told me "Everybody deserves a chance to succeed."  Not exactly a compliment, but still something very nice that stuck with me.

How about someone who is about to? 
Well you have Merlin. Merlin + Tamamo = pretty immortal team. That Tamamo support having her bond CE should be pretty nice.  Try Vlad/Merlin/Tamamo. Shit can still go way south if Vlad gets focused, so maybe be prepared to 'resetscum' a bit.   Keep Vlad's Transformation up all the time. Try to get that skill to 6 at least. Tamamo's NP can reduce cooldown - so it should help Vlad keep that skill up. He is a flimsy Berserker, so he needs all the help to survive.  Aim to NP chain. I think a good order is Vlad-Merlin-Tamamo.   If you want to mess with crits and have a pair of 2030 CEs lying around, it might be an idea to try Vlad-Tamamo-Merlin since its 5 more stars per turn with each OC level. You could get some serious bank off Merlin's third skill in conjunction with the odd Buster card that shows up. It's definitely possible to have 2 Garden of Avalons active.  Otherwise just go for more Arts CEs. Heal boosters might be an idea.  Merlin's invuln skill for when shit goes south - like boss NPs. The cooldown is kinda long but spamming Tamamo's NP should get it ready by the time you need it again.  You basically want to heal so hard that nothing can kill you.

The numbers were much higher overall; but it's not even the same, the brits fucked up on a way higher level. The people's will manifested quite clearly on that one - not the case for Romania.
Yeah, I'm still undecided... Like I said, everywhere tells me to put it up top, but then I spoke to two senior engineers and they said they dont even both reading it so it's best to have it at the bottom. I think I should just chalk it up to an outlier opinion and put education up at top. Thanks for the advice.

Dude, That is around the corner from where i work in the city of london. That place is awesome, it does roast pork/beef/turkey/lamb and then puts that in a brioche bun/chibatta/ina pot with veg.  If you are ever in the City of London look this place up. Its fucking lit.
I support an overhaul of the taxi and medallion system, just to be clear.  But even if I didn't, I don't think that's a valid claim. The jump from "needs numbers kept low" to "is vital infrastructure" isn't a connection I'm seeing.
Like the other poster said, less weight and higher reps. Also focus on keeping your core tight and that should help keep it out of your back too!

First point I'll make about Morning Joe. Trump has cracked down hard on media dissent, anyone that challenges him he calls fake news. I'm not defending Clinton, but Trump is way worse on this.  Campaigns do internal polling that doesn't get publicly released. The [Atlas folks](http://atlasproject.net/) they talk about are a company that does this. When they talk about over sampling, they are doing this because they want quality data on certain minority demographics, not to sway poll results. To get accurate results you have to sample so many people, say 500 people to get a margin of error of +/-5. Arizona for example is only 25% Hispanics, if I want accurate data on just Hispanics I have to sample more of them, say 500 White and 500 Hispanics. This can be adjusted by weighting the data to the correct populations, but you have sample enough to have data about just Hispanics if you want to use it.  Trump's team did internal polling as well. For example Kellyanna Conway is the president of The Polling Company Inc. and it's why her twitter handle is @KellyannePolls. I haven't personally checked, but I bet they used her polling company and I'm sure they over sampled groups as well.  For theconservativetreehouse.com Arizona poll, I'm going to use 538 because they rate pollsters. The Arizona Republic poll is listed as Arizona State University on [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/), they are a C+ with a democrat lean. For [Arizona](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/arizona/) 538 adjusted the poll to just +1 for Clinton. So it's a bias poll, but the polls are weighted to adjust for the oversampling of Democrats. Just above the red text "Good Grief -713 Voters wit a D+34 Sample Used" it says the results are weighted. I did the math and the unweighted results with the over sampling of democrats is 51 to 26 for Clinton or +25, so they adjusted the oversampling but their weighting must be bad because 538 only gives them a C+ and adjusted their poll.  For theconservativetreehouse.com Hart Research Associates/Public Opinion Strategies, as I said above, the campaigns do internal polling, the fact that Priorities USA is billing this pollster is because they are having them do internal polls for them, not to sway the public polls. 538 gives them a B and the poll in question was adjusted from +9 to +5. This poll was pretty much in line with other polls at the time, such as a [Fox News poll](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2016/10/13/fox-news-poll-october-13-2016/) that wouldn't have the bias theconservativetreehouse.com is claiming for Public Opinion Strategies.  theconservativetreehouse.com is ignoring the fact that the polls are weighted to adjust for the oversampling of democrats and not explaining that Priorities USA would be using Hart Research Associates/Public Opinion Strategies for internal polls. NYT is not worse that this site based on what I've seen.
You are talking about socialism as an overall dictum. The word socialism has, however, many nuances and can be applied to things that are wide-spread (such as a socialist state) and more narrow (such as education). And all of those applications of the word are correct.  The fighting comes in when one person thinks the word is being used as in "Venezuela is socialist" and the other person is using the word as in "public education is socialism". These two people will end up yelling and screaming at each other simply because they can't understand why the other person can't understand.  So while you are entirely correct, you are also only using the word in one way.  Socialism can, and does, also mean things such as public education, fire and rescue services, and public roads. Those are all examples of socialism which can exist perfectly happily in an otherwise capitalist society.  In fact, capitalism thrives ONLY when there are many elements of socialism active in society. Capitalism without ANY socialism eats itself and burns out, typically within two generations. It is not self-sustaining because it is not social and we, as humans, are social animals.  Democracy, for crying out loud, is the socialization of political power. It puts political power (or, at least, some parts of it) into the hands of everyone.

We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted  Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:  1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead 2. The order of appearance was swapped 3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title  Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.  If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

Agree. although some companies will actually put in illegal substances and not put the illegal ingredient(s) on the label or what happens many times is the company slightly alters the chemistlry of the illegal ingredient/substance therefore technically making it a new substance and not illegal. If/Once the fda finds out (as supplements do not go through fda though there are several independent testing/quality companies) the "new" substance gets band/products get pulled, then the cat &amp; mouse game continues.

If you want to take a capitalist view of education, so be it.   I find it more valuable that we as a society do our best to ensure equal access to all students to the best education that we can supply, which "school choice" absolutely does not do. "School choice" will only result in the richest people pulling their students out of school, leaving the middle class and the poor behind to stumble along on a dwindling tax base .  Teachers and their unions are not as profit-motivated as you seem to think. If they were profit-motivated, they would not have become teachers. For the large part, teachers care about their students. If professional educators oppose some change to our education system, I am inclined to take their word for it.
I think it looks very nice! :)

Budgeting a negative amount into your credit card is giving you a positive amount in TBB. YNAB acts as if it's a credit (to your benefit) to your CC, like a refund or something. Set it back to $0.  You are creating debt because at the end of the month you don't have enough money to cover the CC purchases. If you will have enough by the time you pay off the CC, that's "riding the float", if you don't, you'll have CC debt that you'll have to work off at some point.

I'm confused. So people who enjoy the unique challenge of trials should not play trials after they've done their flawless runs? I don't get it. Trials is supposed to be a challenge. I've gone flawless a few times, and it was always quite a challenge, but it's almost like you're proposing that players who are actually good completely stop playing the game mode because they're too good, and low skilled players need a free handout.  It's also funny that you mention a streamer carrying people vs people paying. Regardless of your method, you're still going out of your way to "ensure success". Playing with a steamer sounds like something you have to seek out, and sounds more difficult than paying for it to be honest, but even if you are paying for it, they're still real people. Despite TOS stuff that you can't really prove, so long as there's no lag switching or anything network-wise, what exactly is the issue? These other people are "too good" and you need them gone to ensure success? This just sounds like more "free lunches" bullshit if you ask me. I'm ready for my downvotes. Yes, the destiny community is nice sometimes, and helping others is great, but you're telling others to stop playing a game type that's unique and fun, simply so others can get things that are meant to be a challenge.
I'd like for everyone, not just one side, to answer the questions that they are asked instead of deflecting and talking about what the other side did that was wrong, or similar, or worse than "x".

I'm 27, I've got depression, adult ADHD, and anxiety about both.  I can't remember  *shit* anymore. It's actually becoming a real problem. I can't remember names at all, I legitimately have to write them down. I have to write everything down, actually. I keep a notepad in my back pocket and if I think of something in need to do later, I write it down because I will not remember to do it.

Today I will tell myself I need to go back to college and do ______ but next week I'll look back on this week and think I was being stupid because I should ACTUALLY be doing _______ with my life. I can't pick a direction in life because I'm so easily distracted.

When this type of thing happens, is it fair to say that the ghost is purposely turning the light on, do they know that's what they are doing? Or is it just that their energy is able to move something as weightless like a light switch, as opposed to moving a bed or dresser etc.  Do you think that in this case the family member had it in their head that they would try to communicate after death? It almost seems frightening that these things happen like the lights turning on or moving other things around, but surely its them just trying to communicate in the only way that they can.

It isn't supposed to be seen on the main program output.   A waveform monitor or rasterizer can detect the presence of ancillary data, but may not decode it without an option.   Since your card has 2 channels, you can feed the output of one channel into the other channel to confirm the presence and decode the captions.

A few pictures from my first time making sushi at home. I got some gift cards for Christmas, but couldn't think what to buy until I spied some tuna and salmon in a fish merchants window. I bought some seaweed salad and roe from there as well, and got to making some basic rolls. I actually forgot the sushi vinegar in the rice despite buying it, but it tasted fine. (Tastes a lot better with it though!) Even though the tuna was more expensive, I think I prefer the salmon more.

I disagree. If someone doesn't know about a subject, why should I care about their opinion on it?
I was a supporter (was out of the country unexpectedly so no vote but I would have for him). I expected him to attempt many of his ideas and have it get shut down for any number of checks and balances. A specific example would be I expected an imigrant ban to be presented, disputed, toned down, ultimately turned into some sort of enhanced background check before entry type deal, not an overnight white to black type situation. I'm not sure I've ever seen government change move this fast whether or not I was for or against it. I'm getting a lot of what I wanted a toned down version of, and I'm getting it significantly quicker than anticipated.
It seems like YT takes a flat 30% from both sponsors and super chat, Twitch takes 50% from subs (more than YT) in their standard contract but often less for any medium/big streamer so if they also take less on cheering I really think YT should consider dropping their cut, at least to 20%, especially for super chat considering how much less it costs.  Also feels a bit weird when paypal has barely any fees that YT has to take such a big chunk when it's barely any work on their end.
Dray was suspended in game 5 and I think that was the game where both LeBron and kyrie dropped 41, they found their confidence and rhythm and were in momentum. Also bogut getting hurt meant that the warriors had no size and LeBron utilise that really well to his advantage, which means they were even more unstoppable.   LeBron and kyrie both played exceptionally well and warriors weren't really bad either, just really unlucky.

Haha.  As the owner of a Realforce 104UB (which aren't even really blanks) this is why I ordered the "white" FC980C instead of the black one.  I consider myself a touch typist.  But I have realized that I do peek *a bit* at some symbols.  And that peek becomes a 2 or 3 second squint sometimes with the black on black keys.  And similar to your other comment - my boss was standing behind me the other day while I was trying to enter a complex password - and he didn't say a word, but I know that from his distance the keycaps looked blank, and I'm sure he was thinking "how about having visible legends on your keycaps, jackass!"
Thanks haha

Let me make sure I get this straight.   Deporting illegal criminals *is not* keeping the public safe.  Releasing illegal criminals back into the community *is* keeping the public safe.   Got it. 
Darius definitely hurts Sion a lot in lane. Worst case scenario (if he gets fb somehow or has an offensive summoner instead of tp) I'd opt into investing two points into w by lvl 4.Depending on your preference, armor can be added to quints and/or marks (you can configure it with HP in your yellows also if you want to boost your effective tankiness early).   When I play my trynd into darius I often take 2 armor quints and it really helps - my one friend who plays a shit tonne of sion high elo has a set with hybrid pen reds then full Armor quints (with some mixture of scaling and flat health in his yellows iirc) that apparently allows sion to survive lane against jayces, fervor ignite trynd, ghost darius, etc.   Putting points into meditation can also help, as you need lots of mana for e spam and w.  And no you make a good case for it, I actually agree. I went a bit too far the other way though in advocating for Sion in these matchups. It definitely is a counter and without proper play its hard as fuck. But there's a lot Sion has going for him in the matchup as well. IMO he can play a very passive, hands off waveclear playstyle, and still eventually end up contributing a bunch in teamfights. Also its really easy to setup ganks against Darius as sion, so ward up and ping for jungler help.  I was wrong when I said "neither of you should have kill potential". You should be able to use your kit to break the freeze and apply lane pressure without having to trade with him, but Darius is definitely able to destroy sion if you misposition badly enough (there's no coming back from that if he snowballs).

Meh, Graham isnt a top 3 te. Hasnt been since he left. Gronk, Kelce, Olsen, Reed when healthy (rare it seems) Eifert, Delanie are better. Witten is arguable too. He should certainly see more targets, but Graham in Sea isnt nearly the same Graham that was with Brees.

You're talking out of your ass and making silly assumptions, of course I have a problem with all holy books that incite violence, I made that crystal clear. I did not evade his question perhaps he wasn't specific enough. I know there is in the Bible, who says I don't denounce the Bible as well? Because Christianity is put in check by the high secularization of the societies that it holds domain doesn't mean I look over it, but the main subject here is Islam, if you correlate my strong dislike of a religion for racism then you don't know what the fuck you're talking about, besides I'm black myself so you're not making any sense. I'm not a bigot and I'm rarely accused of bigotry, you would find it very hard to find in my entire comment history anything remotely related to hateful declarations against people of any creed. I hate the Islamic ideology, call me an Islamophobe all you want, but this is one Islamophobe that can recite a good deal of the Qur'an off the top of his head.
No. There is documentation and numerous posts here detailing that 10.2.1 and 10.2 SEP matches so there is no issue with Touch ID.

Is it ok if players don't notice immediately that they have been killed so they are a "dead man walking"?  I'm thinking a killer using poison - and that poison could be instantaneous, or not.  For example: All players have some cards on hand, and some cards which are face-down. Every turn stars by the players choosing a card from the face-down pile, maybe shuffling them around first so they can't know who put which card there. If the card is poison (or some other killing method), then they are dead. Otherwise the cards could have various effects, or none.  Another important part, which might take on every turn, or not, is that players put cards from their hand into the other player's face-down pile. That would be how the killer does his/her business. Ideally there should be other reasons to put cards on other player's piles too (getting points? maybe sharing information about the killer?).  Also, a note: An usual defect of games where "people can be killed" is that being dead isn't much fun. Try to think about things that dead people can do to still be in the game (maybe they can not speak any more but they can still put cards on other people's cards. Maybe there's a player who is a medium. Etc)

Exactly. Baseball has 2,430 games in the regular season. Just following your own team is 162 games (provided you don't make it to the playoffs). Football has 256 games, with 16 per team. It means that - logistically - football fans can follow WAY more of the league than baseball fans.   So when the Super Bowl rolls around, they have a reason to care. Even if their team isn't in it - they've probably caught at least a few games with the other participants (which might have been 10-20% of the total season for those teams).   This lends way more national appeal to football.   The World Series on the other hand? The average baseball fan (if they're AL) probably hasn't watched ANY games from the NL Champ, and only a handful from the AL Champ. They simply aren't as invested - even if they watch a ton of their own team games. 
It's cool. I appreciate it, thank you. I don't have spare cash for it now, but soon as I do. I also already read Final Crisis and I loved it. I actually already had Batman Inc on my wish list too. But I loved how weird Final Crisis was, so if it's part of this same series I'm pretty excited! Thank you again!
There's a difference, there's actual evidence of trump's Russian connections, and none whatsoever about pizzagate.   I wish people would just stop with the false equivalency.

Actually he just said the the story is 100% fake, *and ended his thought on that*, moving to the next thought of "you guys are discussing it as if it's happened", clearly *referring to the narrative of the story*.  You decided to add the "there's nothing going on in the city" to his thought on your own, to make it sound like he didn't just debunk the story, but actually tried to peddle something that wasn't true.  Essentially, *you added a lie to his quote to make it sound like he said something completely different from what he actually said.*  Thing is, we can read the original post.

They'd better not do that thing a lot of companies do where they don't give you full system access over a device you own. That especially won't fly here. In fact they should make the software open-source, so I can make sure I'm not letting something that will put someone else's interests above mine (without my permission) have access to my brain.  &gt; The technology would allow governments and corporations to exert a level of control which most people would consider terrifying.  ...unless it's open source, so people can verify that governments and corporations have no access.

There ARE normal Elves on Haven, but they are a minority that is slowly dying off. The MAJORITY of the "elves" on Haven are the Tsurans.  Tsurans are tall, gaunt to the point of skeletal, with elongated arms, legs, and fingers. Their hair is completely black, as are their eyes. Their faces barely resemble their elven heritage, with elongated faces and long, prehensile ears.  Tsurans live on massive City-Rafts that float through the continent sized swamp of Molahar. While not necessarily evil, nearly every single part of their society is reprehensible by most mortal standards.  Tsurans are necromancers by trade, and resurrecting family members as zombies, wraiths, or flesh golems to perform menial tasks is not unheard of. They see this as simply a way to exist after death, and see it as no different than the domestication of livestock. They are ruled by the Lich Court: 52 Tsuran Liches who oversee the day-to-day activities of the city rafts they rule.  Make no mistake; Tsurans are cold, calculating, and may seem cruel by other races, but they are NOT necessarily evil. They just have a completely different world view brought on by their environment than the rest of the world around them.

&gt; Miki talking about Kozue pulling a sword out of him felt like a very in media res moment. It felt like we missed something but we actually get a scene of it when Shiori pulls the sword out of Juri  It was shown. It happened in episode 15 right before the duel.

For whatever reason, if I send pressure against the AI, it seems like they're able to contort their body in the most inconceivably impossible way to get the ball out of their hands. Oh and when they get it out of their hands, it's somehow a fucking high point to a 5'9 guy. Other than that though, normal defense works fine as long as you guard the comebacks if your rush doesn't get to the QB

This is a long story but this is my experience with my iPhone 6s's.  I bought 2 iPhones as my first iPhones back in January 2016 coming from using cyanogenmod and rooting android since 2.3.6  Because cydia has way much more support than xposed framework  And the 6s specs outdid any android at the time  So I was convinced to get a 6s  Both came with iOS 9.0.2  I always updated my 16gb and never jail broke it  My main 64gb I jail broke it the same day I got it  I had that 9.0.2 jailbreak until November because screen cracked and cydia eraser didn't work on 9.0.2 for 6s  Got it fixed so I was 10.1.1 the good thing was Luca said he was going to release a jailbreak  My gold 64gb 6s is rip thanks to someone dropping it in water and not drying it... I was not going to use a 16gb as my main device forever it was on 10.0.2 and still is today  I now had a risky decision either buy the 7 plus and hopes it had 10.1.1  Or buy a 6s and hope to everything it came with iOS 9-9.1 because I wanted a untethered jailbreak  When I saw 9.0 on the settings it's the best day and best decision I've made  I guess this is a upgrade because now I have 128gb lol  But the downside is I have the Samsung a9 🖕🏻😕😢 My other two 6s had the almighty best tsmc a9  That's the reason I bought two 6s in the first place because I didn't want the Samsung a9 due to having worst battery life compared to tsmc  And it kinda does for my use because by the time I get home at 3 im already near 60 or lower By 6pm I'm at Damn 20 percent  In my tsmc I was at least 30-40 around 6pm  I'm not going to iailbreak because I don't like semi untethered jailbreaks but a semi untethered jailbreak is better than nothing but I was spoiled with 9.0.2 and I want my tweaks working right as I turn on my device  I'm not really feeling jail breaking iOS 10 until it has a untethered jailbreak  Plus on iOS 9 a lot of tweaks already exist and I love my setup right now and I have the latest emojis anyways so no need for iOS 10 for me and with [[Bragi]] I get the only feature I like about iOS 10 (besides new emojis of course) On iOS 9 😄😊🤣🤣🤣

No because hospitals increase prices all the time. More easily now that insurance companies are federally guaranteed to demand money. The hospitals increase cost, the insurance companies say they have to cover more costs because the hospital demands it, the taxpayers are forced to send free money. Works out great for individuals that need it, but hospitals and insurance companies make more money. Insurance companies have increasing profit every year, in the hundreds of millions.

Calling Tarmogoyf super busted is a huge overstatement and it's a disgrace to all cards that are, actually, super busted.  Tarmogoyf is obviously good. Really good even.

I'm open to maybe getting married. But I don't want a wedding, what a waste of money.  Marriage isn't a binding deal anymore. People who get married in their 20's and grow into completely different people by their 40/50/60s shouldn't have to be with that same person if they no longer align.

Nice to be able to comment again, after missing the last few threads. I just want to quickly say the last episode with Nanami and her Cowbell has become one of my favorites. I completely lost it watching the episode, especially at [Touga in Nanami's dream.](http://i.imgur.com/cbBSj9H.png)   _________________  Now, the current episode is finally focused on Jury again and expands on Shiori's and her relationship. This was needed I feel, as Jury doesn't get enough screentime, even though she's a great character.   But I’ll be honest, while I definitely like this arc, I’m not feeling the "fights". Especially the one in this episode, I blinked and it was already over. Hope there will be some better ones more at the level of the first arc fights.   The best thing about the fight in this episode was the battle music for me, which was more intense than usual. Definitely one of my favorite insert songs yet!

Ok so I've refrained from commenting about this but now that it's come up in my 7th favorite sub I need to make an alt.  Personally I like it best as a consensual or romantic thing. It's hard to describe the appeal of giving up one's will but I think it makes more sense in that context. For some it could be a way to take a break from an anxiety-riddled mind, for others it's just a subset of BDSM. As I'm a bit autistic I think a big factor (from the hypnotist perspective) is that it's impossible to misunderstand what's going on in someone's mind, if their mind is under my control.  If you ask around, one common theme is that most of us discovered that we liked hypnosis scenes in books or tv at an early age. So without getting too Freudian, I think in most cases it's caused by deeper psychological factors than other fetishes might be.

The law degree is isn't free.  Even if you aren't paying tuition, you are losing out on two more years of earnings and work experience.  You are in an enviable position right now.  You can cut your losses with no debt.  Do yourself a favor - if you don't want to be a lawyer, and, from your comments it spounds like you might not want to be one, cut your losses.  If you don't want to be an attorney, you are almost certainly better off using those years to break into whatever career you do want to do. 
If I plan to spend $680 can I get a discount?
I think so. I think it's 50/50 to get into beta by the end of this year, 90% that it in beta by the end of 2018. I think that largely depends on how long it takes to finish work on engine components like the player controller.  Deciding to create a whole new game engine in the middle of development is what has really caused things to take so long. If the plan from EA release in 2013 had been followed we would probably be in full release by now but that would mean either some major glitches still present due to to old engine that can't "just be fixed" or some content removed so that the glitches wouldn't affect us so much (think removing every ladder from the game).  The new engine will ultimately result in a better game. From a development standpoint it was the right thing to do. From an Early Access standpoint it was absolutely the worst thing they could have done (apart from just abandoning the game). If DayZ weren't in EA right now and were just in regular development with the devs releasing pics and vids the hype would be unstoppable.

HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE???????!!!??
That comment is accurate. Username does not check out. 
three things:  &gt;Trumps immigration ban  Actually it is really Obama's seeing as he was the one introduced it and used it first.  &gt;Additionally none of the hijackers from 9/11 wouldve been stopped by this ban.  we aren't trying to stop the past, we are trying to stop the present. Those countries that the hijackers were from are not considered high risk anymore and the ones banned were considered high risk by the Obama administration. what your saying would be lets ban Germany because they were the nazis  &gt;1 in 20 million   Because of we are on the front lines fighting the war against them, with us hitting them in their home turf they have to spend resources to defend themselves and so are unable to attack our turf. If we took away the soldiers then looks like they can unopposed plot and and set up for attacks against any country. Take 9//1 for example since you used it. They had 0 opposition and so could setup and plan something this big. But if we were fighting them there they would not be able to send the men to pilot schools and house them in the US for so long before it happened and the whole thing would have gone done much less dramatic
...and they just stabbed the governor god damn it, you would think we would learn but the monkey is so adorable.

Yeah, I totally get that. Like a lot of people, I got upset when the big twist happened at the end of Steve Rogers: Captain America #1. For me it wasn't so much "OH MY GOD CAP IS A NAZI" as it was "dammit, we just got classic Cap back and he's already gone." It's become increasingly frustrating for me how constantly changing the status quo has more or less become the status quo for Marvel.

Update: well, that was all unexpected. Ultrasound showed no follicles growing (hooray, no cyst!).  She was very confused about what that follicle was we saw last time or where it came from hah   My lining was still thin-ish so we're redosing letrozle 10mg starting tonight! Woo for no provera! (I asked if my lining would be all old and crusty, and she said no and that there's some evidence that this way has higher success than doing a provera withdrawal bleed - yay for learning something new!)  We're also adding a trigger which should really reduce the stress on both me and Mr Penguin on timing.  If this is a bust we'll add injectables next cycle, but she's pretty nervous that I'll over respond (she only wants to see one follicle).   So overall pretty happy with next steps!

CPU load is normal with Plex since it will try and peg any CPU to the max in order to build a buffer up. For more streams, you need more horsepower, but what you have currently would be enough for 4 simultaneous transcodes.   Are you positive all of the streams you had were transcoding? Plex will avoid transcoding if possible.  &gt; I plan to have around 10+ 720p streams at the same time eventually, but that could grow later on.  That is *a lot* of streams to have at one time. If you really need that many streams, you might benefit from pre-transcoding your media. Don't forget you will also need a lot of bandwidth for 10+ streams.  If you are not transcoding, you can have many streams on not a lot of CPU power.   -----------  &gt; If price wasn't a factor, which route would you go?  In this case you can't go wrong with dual Xeon E5-2699's.

This. I just preordered the Pro controller today. I had used the Pro this weekend, and it felt great. The idea of playing traditionally, and then taking it all out on one go, instead of fiddling with the Joycons in worth it to me.  With the Wii U, I never really used the Pro Controller since so many games benefited using the tablet. The Switch makes this choice simple for me. Price is a bit high, but whatever.
Can attest it's garbage there's a reason nobody talks about it.

It's a constitutional issue. Turning away people who have *passed this extreme process to immigrate legally*, without any court hearing, violates the 5th amendment right to due process. Providing preferential treatment to Christians is a first amendment violation (freedom of religion). Violating the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, is a big fucking deal. P.S. He basically snuck this into place without letting *anyone*, even top gov't officials, know or review before hand. There's reports of the law being read for the first time as he's signing it on TV, it caused chaos.  The ban on refugees is just part of it. The clear singling out of Muslim majority countries while ignoring ones that have actually targeted us (some of which Trump has personal business in...) is another part. His method, and the source of the language, is another part.  As for the refugees, it's not that they don't have somewhere to go, it's that they need somewhere to stay. Citizenship isn't easy to get, and in limbo, they're often forced into camps or other temporary living. It's a rough life, there's no reason to add insult to injury by tacking another 4 months onto people who packed their lives up and prepared to leave, having done it all completely legally.
It's not overrated, and I would almost define what you describe as room-scale anyways. Standing free of any chairs, with room to move a couple paces in any direction. It's less about the freedom of movement and more about the removal of abstraction, like chairs and xbox gamepads. When you move to standing with hand analogs, it's YOU in there. Your character is standing there holding something, and YOU are standing there holding something. When you're seated using a gamepad, there's a kind of abstraction you go through to convince yourself of presence with a character who is standing there with a gun in his hand when you're sitting there with your fingers on some buttons.
Honestly, this wasn't a bad point. There's no point in getting in online debates. Hence why we come here to make fun of ridiculous beliefs rather than go to Tumblr and try to directly refute their points with logic.
Less development for a solid amount of his Johto Pokemon because Pokemon like Charizard hung around. There was also an episode where Ash faced some rookie trainer and her Chikorita with his Charizard and won easily, iirc.   Ash bringing along a strong/fully evolved Pokemon to a new region leads to those types of situations where the writers need to give them some battles or them coming along is pointless, but you can't really make it believable for something like Ash-Greninja to lose to the 1st trial of the Alola region or have a hard time against it. 
Yeah, but they only turn on him as long as he's to the left.

Darth Vader *did* kill Anakin Skywalker. Anakin wasn't there anymore after he became Darth Vader.
LMAO Pretty much what is was wearing. Ended up taking them off before I would trow. It was a spur of the moment game and didn't feel  like driving all the way home just for shoes. 
".....amazingly, yes, magic does work. I don't know how, as I'm not a mage, but I have brought magic users to the wastelands before and they were able to cast. A couple can even draw power from the background radiation, which is pretty neat. As far as I am aware, however, there are no native magic users in the Mojave, or indeed, in Post Apocalyptia at all." 
Reeeeeeeeeepost
Why just the Apple Watch? Being able to do this on a Pebble or an Android Wear would be amazing.
Danny brown seems to do the trick, for me at least.
It's true
The only rivalry that exists between the Irish and the Scots is around who can drink the other under the table first.
I agree it should be more,  but that's moving the goal posts. The above poster was trying to de-legitimize the election by implying a less than majority turn out,  which is incorrect.  
Same here. Honestly, I bought it because I want more story based games like the Telltale stuff. God, those characters were obnoxious. 
I listed a legend before the breakdown: Map - Breakdown ( Recommended worker count )  Abyssal from natural to natural is fairly long. The effective rush is reduced in the late game once the destructible rocks are broken. It is one of the worst maps for 1-2 base cheese in the ladder pool due to the rush distance and size of the natural ramp.
Little  2  1
Yes. Most games don't depend a whole lot on the CPU. Kaby Lake wasn't by any means a quantum leap forward; they're still going to perform almost identically.
um...edited
At least you can't get her pregnant.  It's a classic case really, one handed down from our Forefathers of Yore, "Thall shalt hit-tith thee then thall shalt forgetheth thee."
*See each other in the hallway at work*   Him: "Hey, how's it going?"  Me: "Good, how are you?"   *He looks straight past me and keeps walking*
Note his hesitation when saying "well.. that's true..umm". He knew what's in Hillary's email will complicate her.
Ahh same. 
Depending for use you going to give it. If PVP you need Responsive, Destructive and either Adept or Competent or Vicious of you can't get the neither the other two. PVE keep ferocious and have Responsive, Destructive and Sustained. Sustained sync more with other piece you mentioned. You receive healing as you crit on the target. Predatory you need make a kill in order to receive the healing. Brutal is an option but it isn't as good a before 1.4 and 1.5. Brutal was very good in 1.3. 
Keep drinking the fear kool-aid buddy, no one ever said anything about open borders. 
Yessss~ how am I going to show it to you though? 
the refugees and immigrants the united states brings in are usually very highly skilled and intelligent. they are quite capable of taking care of themselves and it shows. the homeless in america are usually mental incapacitated or addicted to drugs and its hard to help those kinds of people without legalizing drugs and totally revamping mental health care
I work at housing. The housing deposit is refundable before May 15. Cancel during May 16 - June 7, you're liable to forfeit the $250 housing deposit; From June 8 - July 1, forfeit the deposit plus an additional $500; After July 2, forfeit $250 plus an additional $1000. But I believe if you don't select housing, you'll still get the money back no matter how late it is. The policies have been constantly changing. Make sure you call 215-204-7184 or email housing@temple.edu

As I said twice, they're people who're taking advantage of the opportunities *being in the EU* has offered them. They're being penalised for not living in the UK, despite being citizens and using their citizenship every day.
It's not my primary reason, but I AM going to enjoy the ability to play good quality/performant indie games on a small screen. I have a Vita, but I barely play the thing. The Switch will be a lot better in that respect. 
Neither Lawler or Maia will talk enough shit to sate the Diaz brothers. Nick Diaz especially loves to trash talk &amp; troll, I mean look at his fight against Anderson Silva
Butthurt much, fanboi? :)
It was asserted that the British Army only used this tactic once.   Apocryphal allegation? (Damn, that does roll off the tounge.)  &gt;Smallpox played a role in the failure of American forces to capture Quebec. It was rumored that General Guy Carleton, British commander in Quebec, sent infected people to the American camp. Thomas Jefferson was convinced the British were responsible for illness in the lines. He later wrote: "I have been informed by officers who were on the spot, and whom I believe myself, that this disorder was sent into our army designedly by the commanding officer in Quebec."   &gt;In most cases the evidence against the British is strong, if circumstantial, yet some evidence is quite explicit. When the British sent an expedition to Virginia in 1781, General Alexander Leslie revealed to Cornwallis his plan to spread disease among the Americans. He said that "above 700 Negroes are come down the River with the Small Pox," whom he proposed to distribute "about the Rebell Plantations." His motive was clear, but it is not known if he carried out his plan.  &gt;In 1777 a British officer, Robert Donkin, published in New York a little book entitled Military Collections and Remarks. In a footnote he offered a suggestion:  &gt;"Dip arrows in matter of smallpox, and twang them at the American rebels, in order to inoculate them; This would sooner disband these stubborn, ignorant, enthusiastic savages, than any other compulsive measures. Such is their dread and fear of that disorder!"- [Colonial Germ Warfare](http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/spring04/warfare.cfm)
Steam actually does support optional beta builds. If you go into the properties of a game in your library, there's a whole tab for it.   Apparently they just didn't use it here for some reason.
i think it played a part, i mean warriors fans can make all the excuses but they still had game 6 and game 7 to win. they had the better team and blew it.
