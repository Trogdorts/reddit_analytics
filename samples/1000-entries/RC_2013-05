Do you consider Jared Allen the face of Minnesota with AD on the team? People are forgetting just how huge Tiki was. The Giants made it to back to back playoffs his last two years and Tiki quite literally put the team on his back those years. He put up yardage numbers that matched Marshall Faulks during his prime.

Which patch is important, though I've only been on one of them. I'm currently on Butrans patches (20µg/hour) and it's been great when it's worked. The fact that they're 7 day long patches is great, but I keep building tolerance really quickly to the patches which is not making me or my pain specialist happy campers. I have a feeling I'll be knowing what Fentanyl patches are like pretty soon because of it...  I don't think the pain relief for me has been much better than taking a good amount of norco throughout a given day. I've even been given permission to add in norco as needed with the Butrans which I've needed more than I've actually taken. Maybe it's just a thing with buprenorphine though... It's kind of a weird opiate.

Not trying to attack you, but what's particularly moronic about SRS?  All the villainy and shit I hear about everywhere else is pretty far from what my actual experience on SRS has been.
1. Liking 15 year olds is not pedophilia, it's ephebophilia (and still only considered ephebophilia if you like them EXCLUSIVELY), and it's normal to think 15 year olds and up are attractive, and in many developed countries it's perfectly legal to even have sexual intercourse with girls of that age (not saying I agree with that).  2. I doubt they think you're a pedophile, they probably just think you're fucking weird because ASMR is really weird. I have subscribed to this subreddit for a long time but I don't experience ASMR and I rarely watch the videos that I get on my front page from this subreddit. Trust me, from an outside perspective, it's incredibly weird that you guys have some weird experience by watching people whisper and make noises. It often seems very sexual, although everyone here will claim otherwise.

&gt; This is weird to me, I up/downvote things based on how relevant things are to the sub,  You and... Not enough other people. Enough people vote simply on "I agree with/like this guy" and "I disagree with/dislike this guy" that they overwhelm the people that follow the voting guidelines.  The current score of a post can easily influence the perception of it. If you see something offensive at +30, it's a joke. If you see something offensive at -30, the poster's an asshole. Hiding the score takes that way, and forces everyone to judge a post on its own merits like you do - not relying on the hivemind as many do (and I'm sure all of us are influenced at least a little by the current score, whether we do it consciously or not).

Awesome! Now we might finally see a law againt burqas.
As a writer this is a huge compliment!
Fuck that.
Fair point, but my my contention is that these people are CONSTANTLY asking other people for financial help on this. And honestly, I think it's more than a little messed up that they first asked for money to bury their first kid (they had issues during pregnancy and kid was born at like 20 weeks and died in a day) and then came back asking for more. Had they just asked for money once I'd be more sympathetic, but at what point does it stop? Yes I realize that adoption is expensive, and as a parent I do sympathize with their plight, but given ALL the money they're asking for (they appear to be looking for others to foot the bill, not just provide additional cash from what I can tell) I feel like they're just asking for too much.

Just to clarify, are you suggesting the aircraft is landing directly toward the camera?  Because I'd wager it is not.   The photo was shot in Boston, which has intersecting runways. And although aviation photographers may be bold, rare is the photographer that would stand a few feet off of centerline as a 777 barrels toward him/her.  Edit: Yes, I know your caption is probably a joke...just providing some observations. It's a great photo!

That's crazy they were getting that much. Around the area I live people only ever pay half the value of the EBT card in cash. It's just something that everyone seems to know and go by, and since the person selling the EBT now has cash and the person buying it can only buy certain things even with that much value, everyone seems to think it's an even trade. Bet they'd kill to get 80% value for it.

I don't think that the point isn't that their actions were ridiculous, unwarranted, or stupid.  It's that the government is capable of oppressing us physically with force.  Of they can lay down this kind of security, then imagine what they'd do in a revolution. Imagine the government just lays down some crazy shit, something big enough to unite the citizens against the government, then how are we supposed to do anything other than submit when the government can pull shit like what's being discussed.  This situation may have been dealt with with positive intentions, you know catching the terrorist, but the people making the calls behind that force still, at least in my mind, don't have the best of intentions in general.  With the way things are going, just corruption being laid upon more corruption throughout governments and business as time goes on, something like that may happen and then look what we're up against.  And Ron Paul is right, that does scare me.
He's 29 now and will be 35 by the end of that contract. It seems like there's a good chance he doesn't play out the entire thing. He played great last year, but at some point he'll start to lose a step. Hopefully that time comes later rather than sooner, but you never know.  Aldon is much younger at 23, but only has 2 more years left on his rookie contract. With lots of other contracts coming up in the next couple years it's not a sure thing that we'll be able to keep him after that, so I guess we could end up with a Lemonier/Brooks tandem at OLB for a couple years.

Yeah, it'd need to be adopted by one particular indexer first I guess, and have modified client(s) created to use with it. Once word got around, other clients and indexers would implement it too, no doubt.  I think it could be a real alternative to having backup accounts. Hell, even backup accounts aren't much use for some things that get DMCA'd into oblivion. Potentially, this way, just the missing rars (with obfuscated names if you like) would need to be reuploaded.  The potential could be quite big.
What are we talking about? Mana-less *AP* champions. So you can knock zed off of your list. Furthermore, akali wasn't changed this patch, and rumble  only received a fix which gives a very small buff, so what you said doesn't have much basis on whether they were OP before or after this most recent patch.  Also, there is a reason I only discussed Katarina. Akali and Rumble can always utilize boots lvl 1 since they do not have much mobility before lvl 6. So I don't see much reason talking about them as there are much easier ways to nerf an individual champions sustain during early game (nerf akali's  passive, nerf both of their health regen while buffing they're per level regen).

It depends a lot on the difficulty, game speed, and what you gain by moving. I usually play on king or emperor (standard speed), and I'll often spend two turns to get a good spot, three if I think it's worth it. Past that it might become an issue. The lower difficulty you are on (and the slower your game speed) the longer you can wait to settle, but generally don't wait more than four or five turns unless your spot *really* sucks (at which point it might be better to just roll a new map). I always try to move my warrior to a hill to get a peek at the surrounding area before deciding.  The best things to move for are probably rivers and a hill if you didn't start on one, and any extra luxuries you  might see. Also consider mountains; being two tiles from one will allow you to build certain wonders, and being next to one will allow you to build an observatory and maybe another wonder (can't remember if it's two tiles or one). Too many mountains can be detrimental however, because you lose a lot of workable tiles.   I'm kind of 50/50 on putting my capitol on the coast. You some advantages, and it's easier to build the great lighthouse in your capitol, but you also don't get much from ocean tiles unless you have a *lot* of luxuries. Later in the game they can be better, but when you are just starting out it can hurt. Putting your capitol on the coast also means it can be attacked and captured by enemy navies (though the AI's generally suck at building ships). I favor putting my second or third city on the coast if I'm near it.  Tile-wise I like hills/grasslands, with as many tiles next to rivers as possible. Having a mountain range nearby is great for defense. Also being near a large jungle is great (especially as Monty), but starting *on* jungle tiles sucks because you need techs to cut them down. Later in the game with the right policies and techs, jungle tiles can be amazing for gold and science. Tundra and desert tiles are bad, unless you manage to get Petra in which case desert tiles can be amazing.

Sorry to hi-jack this topic but I was wondering if Zeal is a good item for Kog'Maw? It's(He?She?) pretty much the only ADC I do decent at and enjoy playing. Disregarding boots my first items are Vampiric Scepter + Zeal / or B.F Sword + Zeal depending how well I'm doing. I find Zeal really helps Kog'Maws early game issues (increased attack speed, critical chance, and movement speed). Is this a good building path or should I consider a different item(Zeal)? Thanks.
We don't have a huge problem with it, but it still happens. A comment at -1 that is an unpopular opinion will keep getting downvotes, even if it contributes really well to the discussion. This solution will make it so at the very least, people might respond to it before downvoting and moving on, or maybe read it and see the validity in the post and upvote it. It isn't a perfect solution, but at worst it means nothing and at best it helps a few people and discussions.

It's 8 years old. Debian is 19. Windows NT is 20. WPS Wang Word Processing System is 40 years old.   None of that is really relative for how useful it is - in a general case scenario - for our parents. It's still designed for nerds, by nerds. Maybe - hopefully- one day, but not today.

I am very interested in the outcome here. Two years down the line, will there be more or less violent crime? This could be the first step in a long road to proving private citizen gun ownership leads to more FREEDOM... and less crime!

No, but I can pass any measure you give me.
It's been my experience that people bragging about their ability to drive while stoned are often doing so because someone else has tried to convince them that they're a menace to society for even considering driving two hours after smoking a bowl.

Don't mind at all..  My first was in English/Creative Writing   Second, and the one I didn't end up going for because of the life crippling debt, was Music Therapy. If you don't already have a music degree, you have to go for the bachelors (which is why I didn't go for a master's) and there are approximately 40 colleges in the U.S. that offer that degree, because it's a relatively new field.

The "government" employees all kinds of work.  From rocket scientists to gardeners to cattle farmers .  List doesn't stop there, cafeteria workers, model builders, and more and that was just at NASA (JSC).  
Government's regulatory agencies create an "innovation black hole" preventing private consumer advocacy groups who would do the same thing they do, but now we are beginning to see the natural emergence of government regulatory replacement. We have consumer reports, the consumerist, thousands of blogs, amazon product reviews, yelp, mystery shoppers, surveys on receipts for feedback, etc. We are the regulators.

I was [looking into this last year](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+uglify+your+bike), and I found [TreeHugger](http://www.treehugger.com/culture/10-diy-tips-for-making-your-bike-the-ugliest-on-the-block-camouflage-against-bike-thieves.html) had the best guide.  (Un?)fortunately, your bike is going to look like a good bike to anyone in the know.  Proper security is probably going to do you more good than making your bike ugly.  Your bike isn't worth *that* much that you want to spend $400 securing it, so here's a few tips.  First, you can get rid of any quickreleases, in favor of either [locking skewers](http://www.amazon.com/Pinhead-Bicycle-Locking-Skewer-Pack/dp/B001Y9X328), [gravity skewers](http://www.amazon.com/OnGuard-MinPin-3-Piece-Locking-Skewer/dp/B00773XY9M/), or something else that will make taking the tires off more of a pain. Second, use a u-lock *and* a cable lock.  Both wheels should be secured separately, both to the frame, and at least one of the locks through your bike rack (both should fit, if your u-lock fits right now).  The purpose of the two types of locks is to require two types of tools to free your bike from the rack.  Third, get renter's/homeowner's insurance to cover the bike.  Should be less than $10 a month, and will give you peace of mind. Finally, if you just want to prevent people from riding away with your bike, there are.... [other... less safe-for-work methods](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SD_w94R_2MI/AAAAAAAACXc/G6EEX5zfGjQ/s1600/dildo%2Bbike.jpg)...

It's all how you look at it, despite how frustrating it may be. If I recall correctly, you don't lose any MMR in a promotion.   Under the old system, you would simply lose the game, lose some elo, and have to suck it up.  Now, you lose your game, but *you still have two (or four) more chances to get bumped to the next tier anyway.*

My expiration date is 6/13 and I haven't graduated yet. I highly doubt that my card will get shut off at that date. I'm assuming it is just a date ~5 years past the issue date and it gets shut off soon after graduation. I may find out if that is the case if I head out to the city some time this summer and try to use it on the bus.

I don't like smoking and it has claimed people close to me. While most men I know that smoke are trying to quit, it's mainly for health reasons, and certainly not out of *shame*...  Judgemental attitudes like this and arbitrary age distinctions only serve to further entrench opinions and help no one.
Not that I like it, but I wonder how and/or how much pictures/articles like these (I assume it's from an article?) helped morale.
Ugh... can't wait for the easily offended crowd to turn this into *another* overblown drama-fest. /s

After reading the article, I'm in the exact same boat.  I always knew I had a lazy eye and such, but I didn't really know what I was missing until I tried Nvidia 3D vision for the first time.  The depth in games was absolutely amazing.  Along the same lines as the article, the interesting part isn't how amazing the games look in 3D, it's the fact that I should be seeing the world in 3D and I'm not.. :(
Thanks man, although I can't say the same for the 'Nucks.
Brooke is blinding you from where the actual problem lies -- your boyfriend. He is choosing this petty, immature, slandering bitch who threatened you over your relationship. He's 26 years old, but acting like he's fresh out of high school with the drama.  The ultimatum of "friend her or else" is bullshit. Seriously?  "Be her friend on FB or we'll break up" is pathetic and manipulative. Have you asked him why it's so important to him that you all play nice with her? Why is he willing to put you in an uncomfortable situation and risk the relationship over a meaningless friendship with this girl.  It's pretty concerning that he is "blackmailing" you into being friends with her and apologizing for stuff. That's seriously none of his business and the fact he feels he can force you into things is a huge red flag. I can see advice or "Hey, wouldn't it be nice to talk to her again?" but to force you into things? Nu-huh, not ok.
This amuses me

My timeline last month from CanadaAmmo was:  Feb. 20 - ordered on site an In Stock item  Feb. 22 - payment processed  Mar. 1 - CFC gets faxed registration request (Friday afternoon)  Mar. 3 - AB CFO faxes back approval (Monday morning)  Mar. 5 - Canam put it in the post  Mar. 8 - I sign for it.  So from what I can see, most of the delays happen at the dealer side.  So if you have a good dealer, it's fast.  I just ordered a TT33 from a guy on CGN EE, he had the paperwork into CFC the day he got payment.  I'm guessing it will be in the post tomorrow afternoon.  YMMV.
Babies are nearly indestructible. They should make bike helmets out of babies.
Yeah that's what I thought. Too bad
Not too bad! One bit of advice regarding glows on elements - the glow colour should be slightly lower balance/slightly different hue (of the same range) than the line that is glowing.  I.e if its an overall orange glow look you want, the glow can be orange but the actual element itself should be a bit brighter/yellower.  :)
I completely agree. You can hate a villain, but in a way you enjoy hating the villain. Pelant is hated because his plotline is awful, the writing is half-assed and the character is downright boring. He's so predictable!
It's a good show. Watch the "miniseries" first. The first two seasons are exceptional. There are slow parts later and a few bad episodes and some plot lines that don't go anywhere and many feel the ending was a cop-out.  If you're not a whiny little bitch you should watch it.

Then that makes things even easier. The only thing you gotta deal with though, did the ATF pull on of their rulings where this is ok for Sig, but no one else deals?  The best thing about this, is this is a barrel someone could buy for $400, have immediate use for it, then buy the shroud for $150, with $200 stamp, and wait. It's essentially makes a &lt; than $800 SBR/suppressor, that can be used right away. Which, I think is a big turn off for people.   The thing that keeps normal people away from NFA items is the wait time. Really, who wants to spend $1000+ on an item, wait almost a year to get it. Then when you realize you hate shooting a gun with a huge can sticking off of it, then it's another $500, and another long wait.   Having a normal length barrel, on multiple guns, with the interchangeability of what essentially is a taxed tube, is a game changer.
Wow! I can't say anything bad about this sub! Liberals with white guilt, join up and we'll change your mindset!
Now I'm expecting great hip checks.
I don't know, the point is I don't think it matters as much as you are proposing.  Australia is an awesome place to live for all sorts of reasons, and a few extra percentage points of tax isn't going to change the equation substantially.  If you're concerned about macro-economic impacts, it's probably much more relevant to look at how extra taxation might impact people's spending, consumer confidence and the like.  Emigration isn't a big problem, especially given the vast number of people trying to move *to* Australia!
Talk to her about it.  Tell her that you like her a lot but are really nervous about moving forward physically.  Discussing it will help you get comfortable with it.

Yes it is a combination of ATT and Secur-Tek. The technicians constantly mess each others' work up.   EDIT: Spoke with parents, it is mainly ATT, who disconnected our home security line and didn't connect it back. This means they had to call Secur-Tek who then had to come out, generating another bill.

I think what the commenter you were responding to was getting at was why do you need to keep getting _new_ flu shots, and why do we need to keep developing new antibiotics?  (ie, new strains of flu evolve, and bacteria evolve to become resistant to antibiotics. (Evolving changes in the metabolic biochem and various other changes) This is actually a major problem.

Also, for a tag to be legal, both feet need to be on the mat of the outside man, and the tag must be made over the top rope. I remember one match recently, Rey and Cara were in it, where the person tagging in had one foot off the mat, and the ref actually told them the tag wasn't legit, and they had to redo it to make it legal. Made me smile.

CS major here, and I have to say I'm in the same boat as you. I'm afraid of having a job that I hate, but pretty much nobody gets to work at Google or Amazon or any of the big companies. I've accepted that fact awhile ago; I'd say you definitely should simply because 1) you like programming and 2) computers aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Not sure, but I think a degree in computer science is one of the best you can get in terms of job security.  All that being said, make sure you go to an engineering or technical school. The school I'm at has a good computer science department, but I find myself disliking the majority of my classes (they're pretty tedious, dealing with machine code and assembly rather than designing software) but the base knowledge you obtain in class is invaluable. You learn to think analytically and logically and that's helped me in my personal projects so much.
Clueless. Absolutely clueless. Please do some research on John Gray, Lennox, Algtiva, etc who clearly outline exactly what atheism was centered on and around in the 20th century.  Before you do that, stop wasting words on shit that is completely ignorant of your own belief.  When did Atheists lose their intellectual discipline to adopt a popular and ignorant view?

Imo it should all revolve around a lisencing system. To run a business you mist get a liscense for woad industry from some sort of mod or admin. You can also have the possibility of buying exsisting liscenses from other players.   Here are a two "hypothetical" scenarios that show each.  #1 player Dagny Taggart wants to start a railroad so they get a liscense from the Government (mods) this loscense costs money. To start working Taggart buys material for rails from rearden metal. To get his metal, Rearden buys ore from and coal from the Dannager coal mines and D's aconia mining. When Taggart has her railline set up companies like Rearden metal can ship their resources on said line. Multiple people enter each industry driving compitition.  #2 Using the above scenario, let's assume Rearden loses a reliable supply of metal so he decides to buy a mine from an exsisting mine owner. Money is exchanged and Rearden now has a liscense for mines as well as his foundries.

Depends on the colour of all of the things you wear an how obnoxious the logo is on all of them. I don't own Ray Bans, but my friend has a black pair that is incredibly tasteful. Sperry's are really nice shoes but if they're also the "Look at how expensive my shoes are" attention-grabbing colours, then it's annoying. Same with RL. If its tasteful and you don't think yourself superior because of how you dress, then you're fine.

Problem with removing weapons are that people bought it with SC, nerf or buff sure, but I doubt they can remove something like the AV turret without people being afraid of future purchases.   I think the TR should get a mortor but its one that splits off into numerous low damage grenades. Lots of shells, low damage.   The NC should get a super powerful rail gun but with one draw back. It blows up after a single use and does half damage to the enginer. So a full health engineer would have its shield gone and no more turret. The cooldown wouldnt start until after its been blown up.

AS Val is my personal favorite, as I usually run with the PK-A 3.4x, (or the EOTech or even the RDS in close maps, though PK-A is almost always on there.), and the extended mags.   Sometimes, I'll switch over to an MP7, UMP, or a P90, in that order.
I think I'm in the same boat. When the votes are visible, a lot of the time I wind up downvoting a lot of the "oh god, why is this being upvoted" posts and not upvoting already high posts because everybody else has it.  Now I'm being way more proactive, and trying to make sure the posts that shouldn't get upvoted don't get it in the first place, and being less complacent about letting good posts slide.

I bought the V-Moda M-100s recently in white and I have to say, compared to the G35s I've been using for years (finally cracked and about ready to dismantle themselves) they sound just wonderful. I'm sure for real audiophiles they might be able to tell that they've not been worn in properly yet or whatever but the quality of sound coming from them is absolutely phenomenal to my untrained ears. My one complaint is that they are much tighter and a smaller fit than I would have gone for normally but as I also use them while out and about they are very appropriately sized. They give a bit of an ache after a while of using (5+ hours) but I'm used to the loose fit of the stretched-to-hell G35s and these are becoming more comfortable with time anyway. The build quality is amazing. The hinge that lets them fold is probably the most solid bit of steel I've seen on any headset and they really just feel like you got what you paid for, a fantastic piece of kit. If the M-100s are in your price range then I would say maybe you should go for them. However, like I've read a couple of times in other headphone upgrade comments, I now feel like I need to upgrade my entire music collection to at least 320kbps+ mp3 or lossless formats and grab a decent soundcard as well (probably not a bad thing).

~~You have a 64 bit system. Download Java JRE (Java runtime environment) for your windows version (= 7 or 8) 64bit. And use the 64bit bat file to start the game. It should use C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\java.exe. Not sure if thats the actual problem though since it seems to be running on your first and last screenshot.~~   ~~It says "not enough storage available..." maybe your disk is full?!~~   ~~could also be a variant of the intel bug. It might have to do with problems with the allocation of virtual memory, which would explain the "out of storage" error message....~~ ~~**tl;dr:** Use the 64bit batch. If your disk is not full it might be the intel bug.~~   --------------- EDIT: Alright, after some research, I am pretty sure the error means that you are running out of heap memory. Funny thing is, that should not happen on a 64 bit system ~~which you obviously have~~ (given enough ram is installed). How much ram do you have? Does the error persist if you use the 64bit batch file?  In the 64bit batch, try to change the xmx parameter to "-Xmx1024m" or higher if it's not already like that.  Do you have a 64 or a 32 bit system?? An easy way of determining that is to check if theres a "Program Files (x86)" folder. If it is NOT there (=32bit) google for "3gb switch", else try the above.

Never heard of it, but saw it while i was at a craft beer bar this past weekend and tried it out. I really liked it. Right out of the cooler, the hops outweigh the coffee, but let it warm up a little and the coffee flavor comes out some more. Definitely something a little different, and in my opinion, it works.
&gt;Those are not your friends. They are assholes who only wanted to bring you down because they say you trying to improve your life. And you let them succeed.  &gt;Dump them, if you haven't already.   It's not like that. Despite however much hard they may have accidentally caused, they were coming from a good place. They have always been there for me, and honestly felt that I was needlessly breaking my back for an unreachable goal.  I would have got rid of them in a heartbeat if I had felt they were just saying those things to hold me down.  &gt;You just said that strangers, even behind the veil of anonymity, have told you that you're not ugly. So why are you working overtime to ignore the evidence?! You're contradicting yourself. You're not ugly but you're determined to think you are.  Eh, AIU is kinda a circlejerk where people just tell each other they're good looking. Plus I feel that people in real life have a better sense of what I look like than my photogenic pictures. That may not be the case, but it's how I justify it to myself at least.  &gt;Let me ask you something, if I was drinking something and had a sour look on my face every time I took a sip, would you want any of it if I offered you some? So to, is your attitude convincing others not to give you a try.  There is definitely some truth to the attitude coming through in my approaches, but I have worked my ass off on "faking it until I make it." I have done tons of work on eye contact, smiling, and posture, even before I learned to not like the way I look. I'd think that it'd get me at least one metaphorical nibble from the opposite sex, especially with me putting myself out there quite often. Still though I haven't even been flirted with, let alone k or f-closed. If my friends had told me I was ugly, but I was getting attention from women, I would have laughed in their face. But my reference experiences kinda prove them right to my shame :\  My instincts want me to tell you that there's no possible way that person 2 in your example is as bad looking as I am, but that's my BDD talking and I have no way of knowing. All I can tell you is that I want you to be correct, I really really do (why I've broke my back working in this). I just don't know how to produce that level of charisma/attitude despite all my efforts to do so. If it isn't my looks than I'm afraid I just don't have that "It" factor or whatever it may be. Either way it's scary to me to think there's in impregnable barrier between me and success cause I want it *sooooo* bad.   &gt;I think you're lying to yourself and overlooking reality. I'm willing to bet that you get interest or attraction sometimes, but you squash it with your attitude and/or talk yourself out of believing that it's real. I don't know how many times I was out with Friend #1 and saw girls express interest in him, only to watch him negatively talk himself out of believing it was true, and simultaneously convince them that they were wrong to be attracted to him. It was frustrating to watch.  I very well might be purposely obscuring some of my successes or rationalizing some experiences. The thought has crossed my mind often. I can assure you though that I never ever self-deprecate or belittle myself when talking. I always try to maintain good body language, eye contact, and make sure I smile. I just can't help but think that there would have been some experiences that I would have had that could not be rationalized, like someone obviously flirting with me, a random make-out, or even attention from someone heavyset or someone who doesn't take care of themselves.   An easier way I can put it is this: with as much as I put myself out there, I would wager 19/20 guys (at the very minimum) who worked on themselves as much as I have would have gotten someone even accidentally attracted to them to a point it was obvious.  &gt;If you have such consistent through patterns undermining you (thoughts of being unattractive), you fucking OWE it to yourself to constantly stand up to yourself and reiterate the fucking truth: such thoughts fly in the face of evidence to the contrary.  You're absolutely right about trying to be positive. It's just that whenever I try telling myself I'm attractive enough, my mind reminds me multiple ways why I'm wrong. My goal is to reframe everything to be positive though, however difficult it is.  I know I was negative throughout this, but I just felt you get an accurate picture of how my mind thinks through these kinds of arguments. You should know though that I really appreciate all you have wrote, and hope you are correct.  At the very least, you convinced me to press on a bit more. And I am incredibly thankful for that.

I don't really have an inherent problem with the id check, it is the trickle down into every other aspect of life that is the problem, and how kids are never given the freedom to learn on their own.

That freedom no longer exists for most kids today because for sure a bogeyman will get them... which is far more hysteria than possibility.

Because you can't allow for the remaining huge percentage of private sales to receive a background check due to the bizarre anecdote that your state has laws that are stricter than said proposed national laws.

Deny what you meant all you want, I read it and can comprehend what you are suggesting just fine, thank you.

Earplugs. If you're like me, loud, shrill noises trigger your HULK SMASH instinct.  It was a real problem for me until I popped in some earplugs.

Not at the federal level, but there's been some push at the state level in response to gun control threats. We'll see what the 2014 elections bring. If pro-gun Senators gain seats, we may be able to force Obama to make meaningful gun reforms if he wants to pass anything on his agenda. Like this push back against gun control, that can be organized at a grassroots level. All we have to do is ask for it.
Why? In what way? A superstition is "a widely held but irrational belief in supernatural influences, especially as leading to good or bad luck, or a practice based on such a belief." (OED).  Belief in a god is emotional rather than rational.  Some set of events happen and the emotional side of believers might see it as a supernatural intervention.  i.e.Praying that someone gets well and then they do.  The believer says god answered the prayers.  No evidence one way or the other for that statement.  It is not rational; it is emotional.  In no way am I saying that emotional thinking is bad.  Without it we would not have "love" or "beauty."  Emotional thinking takes an event, creates a meaning that causes an emotion.  And emotions are what gives life its bounce.  Human beings are mix of emotional and rational thinking.  It varies by person.  Neither is bad or wrong while the other is right or good.  The rational side is interested in what is workable and gets results.  The rational side sets and objective and goes in a nearly straight line to achieve the goal.  The rational side is not very interested in the side effects of reaching the goal.  The rational side accomplished great things at a great cost and accepts the casualties along the way. i.e. Ford decided that fixing the Pinto was more expensive than paying the judgments resulting from the law suits.  That is a very rational way to view the world.  The emotional side determines that some costs are too high to pay regardless of the great thing that must be forgone.  So Ford loses a lot of good will when their position was made public. And we save an endangered species and forbid developing a wetlands.  People with a reasonable balance between emotional and rational thinking are called "moderates."  :)

You think it would be a good thing if christie made major cuts to education and transportation?  His cuts at the state level in new jersey were so bad, the state supreme court ruled them unconstitutional.  The current budget is now exactly where it was before he made his cuts.  We watched as christie governed and failed in the worst possible way.  His ideas weren't even constitutional and he essentially proved that schools already had the least amount of funding they needed.  Now he wants to push private school vouchers in another attempt at defunding public schools.  Right now his biggest legacy is that he canceled the tunnel project and jacked up tolls for the bridges while neglecting roads in need of repair.

I played it twice since the first time I kept getting frustrated trying to figure out which color I was influencing directly. Both times I had similar scores though.   I found the later tests harder only because it felt like I had less time, and I didn't like that the 'timer' was the amount of the color you had to match. I kept looking back to compare the colors and where I was looking wasn't what I should be looking at and I'd have to find out where it was and it was frustrating.   But still fun.

Never say I'm sorry, it indicates that you did it knowing it would cause a problem and are likely to do it again.  If you are sincere, state that you will never let it happen again and stick to it.  Don't try to cover other individuals blunders in the workplace, it will only make you look bad.  IMO of course.

Just because you don't like my derision of religion doesn't mean you get to decide how I speak about it.  The way I see it, religion is responsible for mass killings, the victimization of children, the accumulation of obscene amounts of wealth in the face of extreme poverty, subjugation of people deemed to be of a lower class than certain believers...etc.  If all I do is poke fun and mock, they should be extremely thankful.

Well I would wake up a few times a month in the middle of the night to my girlfriend at the time talking yet not in English. She would talk in what sounded to me like gibberish but the way she was talking was like she knew exactly what she was saying. But it was one time in particular that freaked me out. In the middle of one of her talks she stops dead and right after there was a loud bang on the wall. The wall that to connected outside. Not sure how I fell back asleep.

While it's true that almost everything in Minecraft suffers from a lack of depth, almost all of these problems are a direct result of attempting to maintain competitive PVP in SMP which has obviously *never* been a serious design goal in Minecraft.  
I would assume the phone could be used as contact information to help get a job. No one uses the mail anymore. It makes sense to do this.
You can't be to safe. I almost got hit by a car going the wrong way on a one-way street. But luckily my ears saved me.
1.  She called the passageway a "bottleneck", and then stated that if the woman had said "excuse me", OP would have allowed her to pass. Meaning, [there was room to pass, and all that was blocking the way was OP.](http://i.qkme.me/3tzrzr.jpg)  2.  You stay close to your favorite stand and continue drinking until you are plastered, because if your plan is to get drunk you don't care about tasting different beers - your goal is to get drunk.
As a white person, I always read articles like this. Then I look around at my little apartment, listen to the police sirens and shootings outside, consider my cheap diet, my second hand clothes, my 30 year old bike that I use to get everywhere because I can't afford a car or public transport, my 20+ rejection letters from job applications I have sent out.. and I sigh, and wonder where I went wrong, and get back to studying to desperately try to make something of myself.  Although I am grateful for the simple pleasures - a roof over my head and food on the table - gettin' really sick of it all.
*Call of the Wild* and *White Fang* by Jack London are pretty powerful. It's about sled dogs but there are strong underlying tones of the battles between the north and south of America in the past.
 Well thats easy, I would store more of that video in my hard drive, since I think could fit more of that in it. Also I would upload it faster to anywhere I want since it was smaller in size. Also I would stream anyone else's content faster, since I could use it faster.  (I hope that makes sense, I shouldnt drunk-reddit)  edit. but on the downside, I probably wouldnt be able to play any of that shit with my laptop, since its even struggling with current videos 
Dude, you should do some research before post ideas like that, these ideas have been suggested already

What would you say to people who can't qualify for a good job? Do they have no dignity because they had to pee in a cup to get a better job?  Never been an intern, but every time someone talks about it, they say your just being the office bitch anyways. It's not like your boss is sitting there watching you pee in the cup.

Agreed, save for how everything paid off (or rather, didn't) Series Five was by far Moffat at his strongest as showrunner.
This. So much this. I mentor freshman college girls and teaching them that it's okay to trust their instincts about guys and other girls has been much more of a struggle than I expected.  I have never regretted following my instincts. I have regretted being "too nice."

Just buy CFL bulbs with a different color of light, and make sure they are the ones that say "Dimmable" on the box. Lowes and Home Depot carry them.
I think it's safe that you don't need to show up. As to whether your duty has been served (thereby exempting you from additional jury duty for some period into the future): in my jurisdiction, this would not count as having served jury duty and you would return to the pool for future selection.
Dude you choose to read it...wasn't even in all caps.  Seriously though, what good does it do to try and create a separate state government within the US?
Oh, of course. It's just that if one has a favored means of doing it, it's usually going to be one or the other. The specific example involved an oral/anal contrast because that's what I run into most often when such preferences are stated. I certainly was not trying to push some kind of false dichotomy, thus the plural "alternatives" in use.
Part of me wants to believe this the work of a particularly talented troll.

Not a security guard but a bouncer at a bar with good cameras. Two of the maintenance men at the bar/hotel I worked at got piss drunk one night and started whipping pint glasses and beer bottles at one another. I was working that night and the bar was quite empty. I let them have their fun knowing the cameras were rolling and they had pay checks to dock. They managed to break 25 pint glasses and a tv, and got to pick it up the next day.
Probably because they are.

It's an interesting video, no doubt, but  Morgan Freeman's mistaken, if only about this one thing. He's right about Black History Month, but he's wrong about the 'Stop talking about it will solve it' perspective. Time and time again, any method of 'colourblindness' as a cure for racism is shown to be unhelpful and even negative.  Going to post a part of an essay by Tim Wise (yes, a white guy) and a link for those interested. You don't have to buy into it, but it makes for some food for thought contrary with Morgan Freeman's thoughts regardless. The Morgan Freeman video gets posted every so often, and just for the sake of diversity, perhaps seeing a different perspective might be of value.   &gt;**Liberal Colorblindness and the Perpetuation of Racism**  &gt;By “liberal colorblindness” I am referring to a belief that although racial disparities are certainly real and troubling — and although they are indeed the result of discrimination and unequal opportunity — paying less attention to color or race is a progressive and open- minded way to combat those disparities. So, for instance, this is the type of colorblind stance often evinced by teachers, or social workers, or folks who work in non-profit service agencies, or other “helping” professions. Its embodiment is the elementary school teacher who I seem to meet in every town to which I travel who insists “they never even notice color” and make sure to treat everyone exactly the same, as if this were the height of moral behavior and the ultimate in progressive educational pedagogy.  &gt; But in fact, colorblindness is exactly the opposite of what is needed to ensure justice and equity for persons of color. **To be blind to color, as Julian Bond has noted, is to be blind to the consequences of color, “and especially the consequences of being the wrong color in America**.” What’s more, when teachers and others resolve to ignore color, they not only make it harder to meet the needs of the persons of color with whom they personally interact, they actually help further racism and racial inequity by deepening denial that the problem exists, which in turn makes the problem harder to solve. To treat everyone the same — even assuming this were possible — is not progressive, especially when some are contending with barriers and obstacles not faced by others. If some are dealing with structural racism, to treat them the same as white folks who aren’t is to fail to meet their needs. The same is true with women and sexism, LGBT folks and heterosexism, working-class folks and the class system, persons with disabilities and ableism, right on down the line. Identity matters. It shapes our experiences. And to not recognize that is to increase the likelihood that even the well-intended will perpetuate the initial injury.  http://www.timwise.org/2010/08/with-friends-like-these-who-needs-glenn-beck-racism-and-white-privilege-on-the-liberal-left/

In regards to your second edit: In my state teachers are state employees when it screws us (such as not being able to collect social security even after a spouse's death or what you paid in your previous profession and that it is illegal for teachers to strike or discuss union actions in depth on campus). Teachers are not state employees when it screws us (such as not having access to the state employee healthcare, being relegated to a separate government controlled/mandated retirement system from that of state employees).  Damned both ways.

Honestly, the first time I smoked marijuana was from my friend's bong and he made it a BIG EVENT. Got out the good stuff, packed it TIGHT, and held the slide for me and everything so I could really rip.  I'd been smoking hookah for a while, and I'd smoked cigarettes before, so I knew SOMEWHAT what to expect, sensation-wise, so I hit it like a freaking CHAMP and went over the moon.  I spent like an hour freaking out because it was so damned intense, and I felt like it was going to last FOREVER.

[**Buckethead** - Trina's Lament](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXY_jCkZcuQ)  Sadly, he only ever played this song one time (or at least it's only ever been recorded live once).  As far as I know, it's never seen a studio release, although with the tremendous amount of material Buckethead's put out in the last couple of years, I can't possibly say for sure.  This is unfortunate, since I'd have to say Trina's Lament is one of the top ten Buckethead songs, which is impressive in a category of thousands, if not tens of thousands.  It seamlessly melds the influences of his mellower albums like *Colma* and *Electric Sea* with funk, hybrid picking, and his more trademark soloing sound found on tracks like Soothsayer.  Although it only briefly touches on the lightning speed he's famous for, it still ranks among one of his greatest solos just for the sheer amount of emotion he puts into it.  Also: I'm pretty sure this post violates the subreddit rules by "invit[ing] list-like responses", but I'll wait for a moderator to make that call.

I don't have an official list, although I probably should start jotting names down.  There are TONS of people I'd LOVE to gift, though... some based on their kind and thoughtful advice, some because they make me laugh, and some just because they have freakin' awesome stuff on the WL!  I also have plans to host a contest and gift someone (or someones) who is dealing with f'ing cancer (or other shitty illnesses) in their family.  It's been hell watching my mom go through it, and I'd love to brighten someone's day who also has a similar burden weighing on them.   
That's a good idea. I still have a ton of research to do! I'd prefer to do it as quickly as possible since I've already spent so much time getting this degree done.

i have thought about the best punishment for rapists especially child rapists would be.  I do not feel like the death penalty or lifetime of jailtime is enough. These people must be punished everyday.  After much thought i think the best way is a scarlet letter approach.  Brand these people in the face with RAPIST and release these bastards into society.  Let society remind and punish them for their deeds.  society will do a great job.

Alright, let's say I was a married doctor. If my wife were to take ill, wouldn't I be expected to do my best to heal her?  God can allegedly do *anything*. If he is married to his believers, and just allows reality to happen as usual to his believers, that's not exactly being faithful, is it?  A miracle is an indication that God is intervening directly. As such, we'd expect to see a significant number of miracles which occur for Christians who pray. I expect miracles from a faithful God because they are a demonstration of faithfulness.
I do agree that the public application stuff is probably a stunt, but they're planning this in 2023. With a lot of money and nothing else to worry about, I think you could learn a lot of stuff in 11 years.  EDIT: Apparently the top 24 will get 6-8 years training. It also sounds like they want to actually let the audience vote (doesn't say if that's charged or not), so maybe being fake is out of the question. I'm sure most countries have regulations around that stuff.
You've got company.  They even kick aside the anti-mosquito electronics I wear on their way for my blood.  And I hate wearing repellant.  It's a hard life, at times.
I'm not really sure how to word this, but it was only the second game, I wouldn't have really called it a series yet, the first one didn't have multi-player, the second did. If the first and second didn't have multi-player but infinite did, or the 4th one if they ever make it had multi-player, then I would be upset and it would disturb the flow of the games, going from a completely single-player immersive experience too another game with a bit of multi-player on the side THEN it would feel out of place. It's just the fact that there had only been 1 game before they put mulit-player in so I don't think you could quite call the series as being defined for it's single-player experience.
Ohhh... thanks :)  I'm looking forward to it!

I don't have any good advice, I'm coming from much the other end of the spectrum (massively underweight trying to gain) but that's still truly inspiring. It takes so much dedication to do what you've done, congratulations on such a remarkable change.  I'm on a sort of paleo diet, and I can confirm the absence of processed foods and refined carbs makes it hard to gain fat. I'd personally just stick with paleo - I honestly don't believe the fat free ranch is going to make much of a difference, just make sure there aren't too many calories (ie loads of sugar) in it and factor it into your daily allowance.  Avoid artificial sweeteners if you can as well, I've heard a number of bad things about them in relation to diabetes, general health issues and weight loss.  Again, congratulations, I'm really impressed.

&gt;that's not the case at all. If you miss your first shot your enemy has to find you, acquire you, aim, and then kill you. All you have to do is tap M1 again.  Not necessarily.  If I miss my first shot and they're standing in the exact same location, and have not moved, and have not been situationally aware then yes, your hypothetical stands.  Fact is that this will only occur if a person is situationally unaware, in which case it doesn't matter what you use to kill them, as they'll die anyway.  I really don't give a shit about shotguns as I know how to survive against opponents who use them.

My motivation is based on my own experience of feeling this way about girls many times - only wanting her, only thinking about her. But inevitably I find myself wanting to check out other girls or watch porn after increasingly short amounts of time - down from 2 years with my first girlfriend of being "satisfied" in this way to only six months in my last relationship.   I'm just wondering if it happens to all of us, no matter what girl we are with, and it's just a matter of constant self-control, or if it's possible to find a lasting connection with someone that is so meaningful that other women seem less desirable. Is that just in the movies?
What does that do?
"You're wrong" doesn't make you right. I've put plenty out here and you've responded with dick-all other than tone arguments.  Which is pretty sad when all the work has already been done for you to vomit out the same trite "CORPORATIONS + GOVERNMENT = LITERALLY HITLER" nonsense.

Nike Free TR2 and Air Pegasus+ 29s at the moment.  The TR2s have lasted 1.5years so far (still in use.) of both running, everyday use(majority of wear), and 2 semesters of PE class. The soles are worn down, and there's a few tears in the fabric, but they're still in good shape overall with a good amount of life still left in them.  29s I just got recently and only have about 50 miles on them (plus a bit of every day wear.) Good so far.
Oh, I see.  This is true.  A lot of people go to rehab because they're out of their drug of choice and have no access to it.  A lot of people go to rehab because they were forced to.  There's a lot of reasons people go to rehab, but rehab when someone WANTS to get clean is pretty effective.  As far as supervision goes, there's really not much you can do besides educate them on how to do it, and hope they take your advice.  For example, the friends thing.  You can't just stop doing drugs and roll with the same people that you did drugs with.  It's not a mere temptation, I've heard it described as 'going three years without getting laid and then having the hottest girl you've ever seen waving her ass in your face and begging for your dick.'  I've seen people try to get clean and end up using again because of this.
I'm going to go ahead and guess its the huge quantity of young kids that are just naturally a little immature compounded by the anonymity of the Internet that brings out the idiot in so many gamers.

Jerry Reese was just on ESPN radio yesterday saying he didn't see the contract as a concern and that both the Giants and Cruz have each stated they would like for Cruz to stay a Giant. He encourages Cruz to try and get the best deal possible, etc etc. Sounded fairly confident that both him and Nicks would stay as Giants beyond the 2013 season.
That's your option, obviously.  I was not trying to make it about me, I was simply stating that not everyone did it for attention, and "not everyone" could just as easily include women because they're all going to have their own reasons.  
Censorship isn't on the map. The end goal is to make room for more diversity among gamers, encoruaging developers to cater to them, and in the end get more diverse and better games that avoid this kind of sexualization because teenage boys are just one of many groups playing.  Seriously, how would this censorship even work? I don't think you've thought this through.  I'll agree that there are more important problems with sexism in the world than boobs in games. That doesn't make this not sexism, however. It's often mischaracterized as feminists having our precious little feelings offended, but that's not really it. These issues are ultimately about representation in and access to an important part of our culture.

You shouldn't be embarrassed if you honestly think you have a problem. Everybody deals with drugs/addictions differently, in your case you are just more susceptible to becoming dependent on marijuana, and there's nothing wrong with that.   I've heard of many cases where a court has ordered rehab for a marijuana charge and it usually ends with the person resenting the program entirely, but if you have a real drive to get over your dependency, then I think it would be very helpful.   If you think it will help, then there's no reason you shouldn't try rehab.

Louisville will be pretty stacked in my mind because Bridgewater is the only player I see going early.  Kyle B. tore his acl so it is unclear if he will be able to step up, and the other QBs aren't looking too hot which means I agree that the Cards might struggle at first.  One more thing, Charlie didn't have Bridgewater his first season at Louisville.  Remember we played both Froman and Burke at QB, and it was also Bilal Powell's Sr year where Strong named him the face of the program preseason.  The next season was when we got Teddy and he got in the uk game after Sunny Will Stein hurt his shoulder-- Teddy, of course, started the rest of the season.

&gt;They shouldn't be able to get it without supervision.  I don't think that's acceptable, at all.  Not everyone has loving parents who are going to go "Oh sure honey, let's drive down and snag you a day after pill."  And you can't paint all 15+ teens with the same brush.  &gt; However, if you think back to that time when you were that age, you would remember that you think you know everything, that you are invincible - now you know you were just a stupid little kid.  That doesn't apply to everyone, it probably doesn't even apply to most of them - I wouldn't know I'm not a child psychologist.  Either way, like I said, you cannot justify not offering this service to people who need it because some people might abuse the system.  &gt;I would much rather that the government spend money on opening more planned parenthood clinics where these kids can go get prescriptions for birth control that can be monitored for side effects and efficacy.  Sure, that'd be great, but why not both?  If I understand correctly from OP's short blurb on the topic the pill still has to be purchased, so how much money is this costing the government?  Because it sounds like 0.  &gt;I have no problem with grown adults doing what they want with their bodies.  Where is the distinction between child and adult?  You can put a 15 year old away for first degree murder, sentenced as an adult, because the law says that they are old enough to understand what they have done.  How is this different?

The reality is, zero people in NYC own those super dooper human powered bikes you linked to above. Furthermore, the majority of pedal bikers ride very slow, and ebikes go very fast and beget reckless driving. Quad runners and ATV's that supposedly have a 15mph limit should also be disallowed from the bike lanes.

I'm glad you're still employed. One of the things that getting laid off taught me was not to ever be without a Plan B, and probably a Plan C. It's too easy to get comfortable and lazy and totally reliant. But wherever you work, you never know when you're just around the corner from a layoff, a downsize, a merger redundancy, a freak firing, etc. If you stay actively engaged and networked with people in your industry, if you have lines of investigation open to other lines of work, you'll not only be in much better shape if you get a shock, you'll be in a better position to leave and find something better even if you don't lose your job.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6GW03WsFgU&amp;t=3m53s  This is one of my favorite scenes in the first season, eluding to Jaime's monologue this season.  "And what about Aerys Targareon? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he called you a traitor? Did he plead for a retrieve?"   "He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours. "Burn them all.""

Actually, it's a related, but distinct hypothesis from the Nine Nations. The American Nations is actually an historical exploration of what makes distinct *cultures*, while the Nine Nations are an exploration of modern politics. And while the two definitely interact (and Woodard pays homage to Garreau's ideas and work in the introduction), it looks at the immigration patterns that formed the cultural core of these regions, and the values that were inherited from their origins, instead of the way that these regions were shaped by the environment and historical events that have directly shaped individual regions.  As an example, Woodard will explore how the founding of the Tidewater area by dispossessed younger sons of English nobility led to a distinct social stratification inherited from England, while the Scottish and Irish immigrants to Appalachia brought a distinct clan structure to that culture, and those cultural influences still shape power and politics in those places. On the other hand, Garreau dispenses with these pre-settlement factors, but focuses on the effects of the civil war, reconstruction, and the industrial revolution on Dixie and the Foundry, that leads to values and policies that also shape those regions. So, even though the two works are attempting to explain much the same reality, they do so from vastly different perspectives. Somewhere out there is a coherent synthesis of the two.

I have always loved cod my whole life but we really need something new. After MW2 the games have really felt like dlc's. I really couldn't take it so i went on to bf3 but i still always come back to cod cause it is so fun.   I believe they need to add/improve this:  * Connectivity issues and host migration. I don't know any other game that stops gameplay just so there can be a new host. * IMPROVE GRAPHICS * Make the new engine good. * Make the maps bigger with more people. At least 12 v 12 or 14 v 14 * More destruction. I dont want to be limited to glass, barrel and car. * Dedicated servers* * Improve the guns. The gun sounds and the recoil.   What they need to keep:  * Zombies or something like zombies. * Interaction with the players. For instance on mw3 when they had infected and new stuff like that.  If it is the same old game i probably wont buy it just like how i didnt buy BO2.   Why am I getting downvoted? What do  you disagree about?

I was going to buy in a few weeks ago and decided against.  I just thought about buying in now. I would recommend buying.  Because I have chosen to wait till it drops a little bit.

I've never actually seen anyone doing any sort of 'tricks' on a motorway in England before. Heck i've never even seen anyone do an extended wheelie before. And never heard of any crap like groups of riders blocking traffic for no reason (Beyond publicly organised displays of protest).  Is all of this crap an american only thing?
I have never heard of that trail, but I just looked it up on the map. It's so long, have you done the whole trail before? 
Why didnt spellcheck get that... Ill go fix it quick
&gt;Only if your class requires the updated one.   I will have to check. assuming the department switches to the 15th edition and i use it for all my semesters, will it make sense in the long run to keep buying new editions? (i guess you can prorate the cost over the amount of years kieso updates his text)  &gt;My beef with downloading it is that unless you want to be on your laptop all the time to use the text, its a heck of a lot easier to use the actual book. You wouldn't be able to highlight, underline, or scribble notes.  well at least with financial accounting i bought a old edition of a random introductory textbook that cost like 2 dollars because (from my limited experience) the fundamentals of accounting never change  &gt;You're going to be using it for at least two semesters worth of class + if you decide to keep it to study for the CPA exam.  good point  &gt;Basically, Kieso is the Bible of Intermediate. It's not one of those books where you can get away with getting an older edition, unless you have access to the solutions to that edition.  maybe thats why im attached to the 14th edition, because the solutions are already online and there is no real guarantee that some dude is gonna upload the solutions to the 15th edition http://thepiratebay.sx/search/accounting%20intermediate/0/99/0

WELL, since he's from Boston (and you derive benefits from that) and you're both now living in Texas, I'll lay out the rules. First off, as you probably don't know the rules (you're a damned New Yorker, and think you're the shit because you support the Yankees, and it's irrelevant whether or not you do because &lt;continue obligatory anti-NYC rant&gt;) I shall explain them to you.   #1) You are guaranteed an independent 3rd party to back you up in arguments; MA provides one to all those who hail from MA. I'm going to assume you don't have one (you cannot argue your fiancé is one, if he is there's something wrong), so I hereby volunteer my services on behalf of MA. #2) For arguments with those who *also* hail from MA, your independent 3rd party (from now on, it is assumed I am the 3rd party) shall back you up *provided* the facts support your argument. #3) For arguments with those who are from the New England region, I shall support you in full, unless my politics differ from yours, in which case I shall support you *only* if the facts support your case. #4) For arguments with those outside the New England region, I shall support you regardless, and shall find + interpret whatever "facts" are necessary to support your position #5) If sufficient facts are unavailable, I shall research the area your opponent is from and provide you with sufficient personal insults to make them feel bad about themselves. #6) When you need my support, if it is via text message or e-mail you should contact me first, so I can find the needed facts and get back to you. If it's face to face, or time is of the essence, you can pre-obligate me to support you, i.e. just claim you have independent 3rd party confirmation of your argument, and let me know after the fact so I can support you.  I've got an endorsement on the way, I'll edit this comment when it arrives. So those are the rules... do you see now the benefits of attaching yourself to someone from MA? Think about that next time you yell at him for leaving the toilet seat up.
Currently in vet school because of my cat. We got her when I was 4, but she died in my junior year of college :( Would have loved to have graduated college and vet school with her. She graduated high school with honors, though ;) We had many great years, and I still see her in the eyes of many of my patients, large and small. Best of luck to your sis.

yes, but NYC and vegas are drastically different. the monorail was opposed by many of the large casinos for years because they viewed it as a way for customers to leave more than a way for them to arrive. they don't want anyone leaving their casinos/hotels. i'm surprised it ever was built in the first place.

Absolutely no doubt in my mind that my best partner was my most recent one. It was a FWB situation. However, the sex between us had absolutely nothing to do with whether we were in a serious relationship or not. We fucked the first time we met in person and it was **insane**. The chemistry between us was palpable. Both our minds were blown and we just looked at each other were like 'what the fuck is going on'. For people who had never interacted before, it was like our bodies were designed for each other and just worked perfectly together. We never believed it could get any better from that first time, but as the months went on, it just got better and better as  we learned more about each other's bodies and tried new things. I honestly don't know if I'll meet another guy who I work so perfectly with, sexually.

I know exactly what you mean. Once you smoke for the first time there's definitely a change in your normal feeling; everything feels real but everything also feels kind of fake. I feel like really it just lets you observe the world and understand it more than ever before. Non-smokers might not view the world in the same way and since most people come in contact with non-smokers more than they do smokers it can make you feel sort of isolated. Maybe that's why stoners are so close with each other.
&gt; Ron Paul is a young earth creationist who doesn't believe in gay marriage or a woman's right to choose.  You're not being entirely fair to Ron Paul.

Thanks alot!
See, I have a question for you.  Why?  Why do you feel so sad? So miserable?  Can you find a reason? Really search. If there is no reason, then you need help. From someone who *can* help. Some peoples brains are different. From birth, sometimes, or they just developed differently. That's what the medication is for, that's what the therapy is for. To help those people. I don't think I can help you. I haven't made any progress: every thing I say to you, you pick your way around all my upsides. All my logic, all my philosophy, all the hopes. I feel like *I'm* hurting you. I probably am.  You *need* to find someone who can help you. Because at this rate, I sure as hell can't.

Thanks for this poignant and interesting article!  I have a question though.  I just received a couple of 2 liter charred oak barrels for whiskey aging.  I was going to put some White Dog in the barrels to age but after reading your article and some of the comments below I am now leading toward placing a cheap whiskey that has already had some aging in the bottle like a WL Weller, Buffalo Trace, Rittenhouse or the like and just adding to the aging in the barrel.  I am thinking this because of the drawbacks to smaller barrels you mention.  So is this a good idea or is it not necessary?  Also I was planning on just keeping the barrel in my wine cellar, but after a coworker told me I should move it around my house to expose it to different temperatures and environments and the same concept was mentioned here, I'm wondering if I need to do that as well.  Could you provide any sagely wisdom here? Thanks!

We all know GRRM would never consent to a 100% evil character. If Talisa was out for Robb's death from the start, that's what she is.
You make two points here and I'll refute each one easily.  &gt;Higuaín and Benzema are some of the most irregular players at the top level, so it's almost like a blind bet when either of one plays; Madrid can't afford that.  How do you want them to be regular when they aren't regular players on the pitch? Each player plays half the season, and together they manage to shoot half of what Cristiano does. Asking for regular play when you spend half the time on the bench is ludicrous at best.   &gt;It's an opinion, but I'm sure another striker wouldn't have missed what Higuaín missed today and would be a lot more effective season wise.  Cristiano missed an in front of goal opportunity today and so did Ozil. Benzema has missed many and Di Maria as well. Today, Lewa missed an easy as fuck goal. Twice. Speak to me about this legendary striker who doesn't miss ever. It doesn't exist. Numerically and visually, your argument holds no weight. I've never met a striker who doesn't miss. The fact that Higuain and Benzema manage to stay afloat is miraculous considering that neither is a starter.

If you have signed an agreement, then you should read it in addition to asking the agent how they get paid, so that you know if they are telling the truth.  If you don't have a copy of what you signed, ask for one.  Some representation agreements have a clause that if the landlord doesn't pay, then you owe your agent a certain amount.

It depends on the strategy. If you're doing ICC, then as short as possible, which is 4 tiles. If you want cities to grow as much as possible and still have room to place citizens, then 5-6 would be needed. Anything above 6 would leave empty space inbetween where no citizen could improve, and might even make it possible for the AI to place a city there.

Hardcore is for people willing to accept death as a forgone conclusion. No one wants to die but it happens. Dueling with permadeath is in the same vein. From everything I have read final pvp info has not been given out or even hinted at. Brawling has no consequences hopefully when pvp is released hardcore will enjoy the option of risky pvp.

Yeah, I've been teaching martial arts (muay Thai specifically) for somewhere around five years, and I always tell people to be wary of any dojo/studio/martial art that does not allow you to practice the things that you're being taught. Even when I have my classes drill stuff that can't really be dialed down all that much (think of a muay Thai trip/takedown/throw), I make sure that everyone gets at least a few full-speed, full-power reps in so that they know it works against a resisting opponent.

I remember it being Friday night my mom would let me have two or three friends spend the night.  Before my older brother could go out for the evening, he had to drive us to the video rental store.  My parents would give me $10.  We would rent two videos and an NES game.  I remember the night we rented Super Mario Brothers 3.  We stayed up all night playing the game until about 2 in the morning when my dad came downstairs and yelled us to turn it off and go to sleep.  I remember we turned it off and turned in for the night.  The next morning, we were up at 6 and playing it in our pjs.  My mom bought down Ego Waffles and we ate and got a sugar high.  We played the entire day.  My friend's parents came over and picked my friends up.  My parents took me back to the video game store and I returned Super Mario 3.  It was one of the best nights of my life.
Well saying CMV is exactly that. Changing a view not a fact. A view is a different angle at seeing something. Whether they be proclaiming a band "sucks" or they don't like walking.
