Very handsome guy, I would love to see more of you! ;)
This is it.  Flair to the right!
PERSONALITY PLEASE
Pretty much both lines being ineffective is most of our problems.  Also special teams problems...
Potential to get a David Tyree picture in retaliation :-\ ..
Step 1) Stop deriving your sense of identity from the media you **don't** consume.  Seriously, I ran into more people today who desperately wanted everyone else to know that they don't care about BB than wanted to talk about the finale.
This is bringing race into it. This is actually, literally bringing race into it. I refuse to believe this is real. This isn't real.
From this moment on I am a defensive driver.
I'm was tired from running, so I am just resting here...   Why don't you come rest over here in the shade?   Um, no thanks. Here is just fine.
I do development in more security conscious industries, but I usually spend and hour or two a day casually reading articles on programming/security. On the weekends depending I might read for a couple hours, not to mention if I have any side projects which might take 10+ hours of the weekend.  As for the pay, the net sec(pen test) guys I've worked with make 6 figures generally, so I'd say yes it's very worth it, but they also work some stupid hours sometimes. Myself I still make a very comfortable high 5 with 9-5 work days, but the reading outside of the job is something I do because I am interested in it, not because I have to.
Flukes 4 lyfe.
Interesting. Thanks. 
No one knows yet...
&gt;My personal thought is "No"   we're done here
I wish I could tell you, but by the time I'm at this point doing this, I'm usually not very good at remembering what's going on. As far as I can gather, the response is very positive.
Actually, as a non-Christian, I refuse to ban Christians, but rather bring up cases as needed via modmail. 
I saw one the other day that just had a woman on it... She didn't even have a dog :.(

When you have squad surplus people are willing to find out how good you are.
And then you put on Monday Night Football to watch the undefeated Miami Dolphins. Bizarro world confirmed. 
Nice track.  I was confused about the gain on the track decreasing starting at 00:36.  I really liked the second drop @ 00:56.  Awesome.
 Firepower doesn't matter if you can't get the projectiles where you want them to go. Think of it like basketball. Is throwing 2 balls from the half line going to increase your chances of a point? Not really.   The only way dual wielding could work is if you are playing a CQB match. Because realistically, you can expect to hit a door-sized target area from 10 yards on your first few shots  And also reloading would take at least twice as long, plus all the fumbling around you will do when you don't have a free hand.   That being said, I would try it. Because why the hell not? Also, it might intimidate your opponents l. edit:more content

By your reasoning Asian countries trounce us in terms of sheer invention and degree of precocious development. And I wouldn't use something like Eupedia to argue that Caucasians invented everything ever. I can't believe I even have to say that.

Poop. Yeah, I should....
At least you're comfortable asking out future partners now.
I hope he has fever dreams and takes like a month to recover, a la Eddard and Bran, and was never really dead at all. And that his fever dreams reveal a lot of cool little details. GRRM has left us with the false implication of dead Starks before.
He looks like kuabara from yu yu hakusho.
I have never understood buying drinks at bars. If you really want to drink with your friends, buy a bottle and have some drinks somewhere you can actually hear well enough to have a decent conversation. Why would you ever want to pay five bucks for a shot of something you could buy a whole fifth of for 20-30 dollars?
Cheap and cheerful fun !
Heres what I've got so far.... I was wondering if I should go with a GTX 760, pay a bit more for a 7970, or even more for a 770... Keep in mind I still need to buy a good mouse and keyboard...

It makes parties pretty fun. Fine line between good amount and too much though.
Well, he had to go at ludicrous speed.
This one's my favorite.
There have been scores of mission proposals for both human and robotic missions over the last few years.  NASA is certainly not lacking in inspirational exciting road maps.  But they can't work outside of the budget Congress apportions to them.
Well I appreciate your honesty.  I just think escalating it to that would not serve a purpose until that is the only option.  I've been married 10 and together 13.  We have one kid and it only really affects our sex life in that we have to make time late at night or in the morning.  I adore my wife for that attribute.  Nobody is perfect, but I appreciate her. Best of luck to you old timer (on reddit).  
Pedro is painful to watch on tv, can't tell if he's nervous about the cameras or just doesn't have the best grasp on english. I feel anxious every time he answers a question.
yes, they've been really firm for a few weeks i like them this way :D
I can't wait for the shit Gruden is gonna say tonight.
Ah, I thought that was a friends or randoms thing. Never even thought about the crew getting involved!  Sounds fun :D
Secondly, they are also 13, they have some maturity growing to do.
This is the best episode so far I guess.  The dude swinging the chair was funny as hell.

Do not listen to this guy.  Everyone in this game follows kill on sight on principle, shoot everyone you see on sight, unless you know who they are. If you give someone the benefit of the doubt they WILL kill you.  No one will give you shit for killing a newly spawned person, most people shoot new spawns.   I recommend you find people to play with as a group, r/dayzlfg can help you there.
That isnt ingame.  Wrong font, and obvious picture.
Okay I'm not in the loop.  What does that last line refer to?
Nice!! Have had it for a while myself, no regrets. 
Sushi.  If served properly, I would love to try to eat a tuna one sitting.
Nice! How much are you looking for?

Going straight to Multiplayer?  Wat R U Casul?
Sounds a lot like you got lucky rather than made a good call. If you're wiping people out 35 yards from goal, it's a free kick unless there's an obvious goalscoring opportunity immediately available. 99% of those will lead to nothing for the attacking team, so you should give the free kick. The one time the advantage led to a goal doesn't make advantage the right call.
Significantly less ballsy.
She pulled out a knife *for protection* while she finally told her husband she isn't going to be part of his crimes anymore. *He* grabbed for her, *so then* she slashed him with the knife. Totally different than her grabbing a knife and immediately going to slash him.
this is awesome.

Well, FCS is the only place for them to go if they don't join a conference. Not sure if there are any independent FCS teams. Also, didn't down vote you looks like more than a couple people did that. Ill give you an up though. 
I've had a Nami skin idea for awhile.   If someone wants to give a go at drawing it, I think it'd be fun. Her name is VietNami.  All her moves would involve Pho instead of water.  I'm not creative...
"So I've heard." He shoots the cue. 
lets contain these to 1 thread plz thnx
&gt;all the emergency health care costs from these people will be offloaded from taxpayers to the private insurance companies who participate in the ACA marketplaces  I have heard this line a million times.  Yours is the straw that broke the camel's back.  Those costs will be offloaded from the tax-payers onto the tax-payers (through the insurance companies).  The people who are not currently paying for healthcare will continue to not pay for healthcare (via subsidies).  There might be a shift from the ER to the PCP, but the costs will still come down on the heads of the tax payers.
I got so drunk I was hung over for two days. 
If the game executes it's concept well and I enjoy myself, then I've gotten my money's worth. Time spent VS money spent is a consideration, but not a big one for me. I feel it's more important the game do what it's trying to do well. A good example is Spec-Ops: The Line. Took me 6 hours. I think I payed like 30 bucks for it or something. That's on the border between too much money spent for too little time, but I really enjoyed Spec-Ops for what it was and even though it was a short game, I still feel I got my money's worth. 
You talking about the post-classic update?
I think this happens whenever i use a 90 pound jack hammer or maybe its just the intense vibrations.

What? You realize there are electronic options outside of facebook right? you'll notice I said "public" website.  And no you shouldn't go back if you don't want to. You've got plenty of options. For one if you don't care you could let the government spy, two you could do something about it, three yes you could go back to meeting in fields if you so chose. and after that there are plenty of options between the two spectrums (even though you're suggestion is that its either all or nothing). Life is all about choices.  Just because you don't like an answer is no reason to exaggerate. I said nothing even remotely similar to what you're suggesting.  
"Sir, we need you to come to the cockpit please?"  "The cockpit?! What is it?"  "It's the place at the front of the plane where the pilot sits, but that's not important right now."
This reminds me of that scientist that did the head transplant experiments on monkeys and dogs. The pictures looked similar to this (but clearer). Haven't seen those around on the internets in ages. Anybody remember that doctors name? He was shunned by the medical community, but maintained his research was valuable to paraplegics/quadrapalegics.
Indeed.
instead of getting coached, you could just keep playing until you get better.
Bear story here. Last summer I was a camp counselor in the Adirondacks. We had to lead 3 day hikes with the campers every session. I had to carry all the tents for a fifteen person hike one session and I had a bad back so I had some icy hot. We get to the camp site, cook the food, hang around and I'm tired so I tell the co counselor to put up the bear bag, he agrees. I throw all the trash, leftover food and toothbrush/toothpaste/icy hot, in the bag and I go to bed. Cut to like three hours later, I wake up to a bear going through the bear bag which the co counselor left immediately in front of my tent. I stay still and figure I'm gonna have to scare it off somehow. As I'm waiting to see if it will just run away or get aggressive I see it go from hungry to sick and it starts gagging kinda. I put my head down and it stops messing around and I'm so relieved I fall asleep. I get woken up by my co counselor (who I'm very upset with) laughing his ass off. I get up and look out the tent to see him standing next to a pile of bear puke that must have been up  to his knees, and poking right out the top was my icy hot, the rest of the food hadn't been touched. I'm pretty lucky for this one.
I wasn't one of them, but I will admit I was very impressed his first season. It just seems something happened over the last two that broke it all. 
Correcto. A note: MT3s/T3s coil heads work in the EVOD, but not the other way around, apparently.
Marcel King of Tervuren. The background art was really, really different than what I'm used to. A lot more simple and blocky than I've ever done. There was other backgrounds that we did in the concept art stages that were pretty intense.

Good thing I've trained my whole life....otherwise there is NO way I'd be able to eat ice cream, move my stuff, AND carry a woman on my back all at the same time....come on, Rene--you set up the consoles and I'll plug in all the cords! Cupy, you, uh...just, stay on my back, I guess. Whatever you wanna do."
Catnip is a hell of drug
I continue to listen attentively waiting for the shuffle of grass or clothing. A solitary breath just a smidge to loud...OR MAYBE A LASER SH-IIIIIIIT!!! I quickly take fighting stance my legs spread, arms primed, as I swing in front of me hoping to split what was intended to be a headshot. I miss and feel a flash of light and heat pass right between my legs...huh. Now I know where my opponent is...and that he CAN see in smoke after all! I rush out of the cloud to face my opponent.

Zyra is a perfect illustration of why this won't hurt Yorick. Not only is she always in bot lane, where she's guaranteed to be up against a ranged champ, her plants also last longer than the five seconds Yorick's ghouls last, giving the ADC plenty of time to work in autos in between last hitting.  How would Lee Sin "easily oneshot the ghouls"? By using his Q and E?  So... you're just going to let Lee waste both his damage-spells, and not punish him? If he has the freedom to use his spells for 5 gold, you've already lost the lane, sorry to say.  Also, GP already gets the bonus for killing the ghouls, so you're in the exact same spot as before minus the five gold. Even if the FIVE gold did matter, why is it so bad that you have to strategically drop your ghouls now instead of just spamming them? Drop them when there's no chance they'll get the gold, or drop them when they'll take an extra hit by doing so. Drop the ghouls and chase after them so that if they stop you bash their skull in with your shovel. You should already be denying so many minions that the ghouls are the only thing they can get. Not only do the ghouls do damage, but instead of getting those 17g for killing a caster minion, they get five gold for killing the ghoul instead.  Because you're YORICK. You stand in the minionwave. And you bash in anyone's skull that gets close. Yorick won't stop being used because the enemy gets a 100 gold for free after the laning phase. Man up and let them have the five gold. Laugh in their faces, because those five gold are the only gold they're going to get. 
Not sure I would have phrased that as "water shooting out of her nice bleached anus," but ok.
If you are arguing about 2, then it is pointless to even talk about transubstantiation in the first place because you don't think that Christianity is even true. Arguments over transubstantiation are *in house* arguments within Christianity.   As far as scriptural support for the words of Jesus being literal rather than figurative, [Catholics do have their arguments](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05573a.htm), but I have not read them nor do I know the objections.

Considering that if the North Korean government had any kind of hard evidence they'd be trotting it out at every opportunity... And given that we *do* have hard evidence and escapees accounts by the dozens that the Northern government routinely and continuously performs such atrocities on their own population - and far worse - my answer is a qualified "no."

the SCOTUS has only ruled on one challenge to the law so far. They haven't even taken up the numerous other challenges on other grounds.  Just because they found one provision to be constitutional does not mean they won't find others to be unconstitutional. Just sayin.
He was just too scary for anyone to mess with.  The interesting thing is a lot of the changes he made to the government were actually pretty good ideas, and if they'd stuck with them it might have actually prevented a lot of the chaos that came later. But as soon as he died they just started undoing everything. But he was essentially saying "Look what I just managed to do. I seized power. No one should be able to do that! So I'm going to make some changes to the laws to prevent anyone from doing what I just did ever again!" And since they didn't stick with them, the exact same thing happened just a generation later with Caesar. And then it became a staple of how the Empire worked.

This question is specifically targeted to the land's Zoning.  If you own a lot or are looking to buy one for this purpose, call (preferably go in person) your jurisdiction's Zoning Office and ask if it is allowed. Very often certain zones have minimum house sizes required to keep uniformity in areas / neighborhoods, but there should be some that would allow it. Ask them.  Also keep in mind that zoning regulations can be bent / modified by Zoning Variances or Zoning Adjustments. This process may take many months because it requires hearings and review processes.  Best of luck!  Edit: Also don't forget your utilities when selecting a lot. A cheap lot may be cheap because it'll cost $40,000 to route electricity, public water and sewer to it. Definitely do your research on that to.

There was a thread recently about Phenibut, and a number of people indicated it did help, but its addictive properties sound too much like the Benzo's that I was addicted to at one point. I switched to Kratom to help stay away from that kind of stuff.

Who are these people who just watch the last episode of the show without being caught up? I don't like them.
Both. Not a hotel worker but have worked in retail/customer service. If you ask for a discount near the end of my sale, have been polite and understanding, I am more likely to give you a discount for any reason then the first thing you do is come up to me and demand a cheaper price. Be polite, Be friendly, If you find something wrong just politely bring it up and ask for a small discount.
YES!!!!

I noticed that too, I believe she will be back tonight.

I'll have to really trust someone before we have sex. I'm not a hooking up guy. Too many insecurity and trust issues. It's unfortunate, because I love the idea of getting plowed by different guys on the random. Sometimes with more than one guy at a time. I doubt it'll happen though.

I loved the scene in the restaurant when Saul oh-so-casually told crazy-eyes Carrie, "Sit down, have some tiramisu."   But at the end, I was like WTF SAUL!?!?!?!?
The basis of your (top level: sigh) critique was, you explained, "The title is disingenuous, is all."  The NYT article's 1st &amp; 4th paragraphs:  &gt;Since 2010, the National Security Agency has been exploiting its huge collections of data to create sophisticated graphs of some Americans’ social connections that can identify their associates, their locations at certain times, their traveling companions and other personal information, according to **newly disclosed documents and interviews** with officials...  &gt;The agency can augment the communications data with material from public, commercial and other sources, including **bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls and GPS location information, as well as property records and unspecified tax data,** according to the documents. They do not indicate any restrictions on the use of such “enrichment” data, and several former senior Obama administration officials said the agency drew on it for both Americans and foreigners.  The OP's Title:   &gt;NEW SNOWDEN LEAK: NSA gathers bank codes, insurance information, Facebook profiles, passenger manifests, voter registration rolls, GPS location and more...  So, *every* word in the title is taken from the NYT article.  Do you think the NSA is behaving properly in gathering such widespread, vast stores of information on Americans (especially ones not suspected, let alone charged)? Were they honest to us or their supposed oversight committees?   Is gathering and archiving everything that's done online advisable? Let's assume you trust Obama (or Romney). How about the next guy?   More broadly, how many of the big terrorist attacks (9/11 through Boston) were caught by this widespread spying on innocent civilians? How many trillions have been spent on this? If none of these violations resulted in stopping these attacks, then isn't it a waste? A fraud?   Your key point, "ZOMG, inaccurate title!!," would be, if accurate, pedantic, given the topic, the article and its implications. The fact that your key point is demonstrably **false** makes it... Well, something worse than that.  Look, I understand. Some of us are simply wired to defer to authority. It's comforting. That's fine. But for something like this, which *will* be cemented into place forever unless we beat this back this year, these unconscious instincts need to be carefully examined.  This might be one of those cases for you to try.

Well, there is a good chance that one of my friends could be in this very situation, as I am friends with many ACPD officers.  I care very much for their safety, and none at all for some loudmouth drunk 20 year old who was already given a chance.  He was ejected from the Tropicana and let go.  They could have arrested him for being dunk at 20, but they let it go since they have better shit to do than worry about a 20 year old drunken local.  But the fuck persisted in being an asshole, so they arrested him.  He clearly resisted arrest in the video and did not submit to being handcuffed.  After a couple minutes, for fear of the officers' safety, it was necessary to command the K-9 unit to assist in subduing the subject.  Kid is an asshole.

&gt; I have obese, cancer-ridden family members that would benefit greatly from reform, but don't want it because of how the media they absorb has portrayed it.  So much for "freedom".  Sure, they are "free" to vote any way they like. OTOH, their heads are conveniently filled with the drivel spewing forth from the for-profit, barely-disguised-propaganda-machine, "media".  Chaining up bodies is so old school. Imprison the minds instead, and the slaves will defend their own chains.

So basically if I invest $300 into a loan that's $20,000 that means I have to wait until they pay off the entire loan? That's something good to know. Thanks for the info. I think I'll just stick with smaller loans like you said. Now it makes sense why they want you to spread out your investments as much as possible on there.

Perhaps you don't understand what those numbers mean. Try to explain how either invalidates any statement I made.  The unemployment rate demonstrates that the majority have a job, as I stated. The labor participation rate does the same. [The lowering of the rate recently has a lot to do with the retiring workforce.](http://www.cse.sc.edu/~buell/References/BureauLaborStatistics/art3full2014.pdf)  Heck, most workers today have lived during higher unemployment than the current recession, so (as usual) you have no point.  And, as I expected, you provide zero stats. Owned again. Your position is based on ignorance and sound bites, not reality. The fact remains people do get jobs, can save for retirement, and can get enough education to get decent pay.  Perhaps you better try and link some evidence instead of waffling about.

Great article. One worry, if we make  TFET work, does that mean we can't stick to silicon? Because silicon is dirt cheap and everywhere. These new materials could be a lot more expensive. That would return us to an era where computers are very expensive.
Months ago, my kids were watching MLP when my dad calls.  I'm talking to him, and what the boys were watching comes up.  I tell him they're watching MLP, but it's cool, 'cause (he liked the Powerpuff Girls) it was done by that same woman who did the Powerpuff Girls.  Reddit gets brought up. He Reddits. I tell him I Reddit.  He mentions that clop is a thing.  He knows.  About clop.

While I agree that not all farmers are the evil creatures portrayed in the videos, most of the animals that are consumed in the USA are treated brutally.  Plus you cannot kill a being that is not already suffering and call it "compassionate".  I don't think I could stomach being a food facility inspector.

Yeah, but for you the trade-off of lowered performance (compared to that of a desktop) is worth the ability of easier transportation. I only move my desktop twice a year, so for me the benefits in performance far outweigh the transportation cost.

currently a student. But so far I've worked most recently as an accounting aide on campus and as an office assistant before that.  I think for the most part firms in public accounting are looking for someone with a pleasant personality more-so than technical capabilities. I know a friend who has a 4.0 gpa but honestly it looks like securing a position for him will be very difficult since he is socially very awkward to be around.   So try to be personable and engaging, and it will not be a problem where you've worked

For a long time I was working on a Grateful Dead song and was obsessing over it, trying to get every note in there.  Being a jam band it was difficult so I ended up learning the backbone of the guitar chords and the lyrics.  I put it away for a while and didn't play it seriously for a good couple months.  Now, recently, after straying off and learning to improv better, I've found I have more fun playing the backbone and improvising little things here and there to add my own little flair to a favorite song.  
This is the secret. I've found the settings to turn off assisted everything. Just won my first online seasons game in about 15 attempts. Much more enjoyable playing. Thanks.

I've been asked to do it a few times (usually when the guitar player in a band is a mastering engineer by day). It can tighten things up a bit if done correctly. The key is to be very gentle with it. Dynamics are what make live music exciting.

The thing that bothered me was that all the bullet holes were higher than where Walt and Jesse would have been for Walt to have gotten shot. His wound doesn't even match the trajectory of the bullet. It would have at worst gone laterally through him, not posterior/anterior.   Although I guess Jesse did put on a few pounds, so maybe that was it. 
Ah I see. Unfortunately I already have a PS3, sorry :(

I'd drop MacDonald for him. He is worth a play, especially this week but Im not sure if he's worth the waiver spot. Personally, I like him. I am debating picking him up myself especially against Cleveland's terrible CB2 while Haden is man on Stevie. But I also want Ellington and I only have 1 open spot so I have to choose one...

Those things sucked! Was just thinking about those yesterday while showering. Was gonna post in /r/nostalgia.  Living in south Florida, we didn't 'need' coats, we used windbreakers! ( Technically, we still don't need coats) 30 degree weather in winter sucked with these things! Our parents thought the windbreakers  were good because it was cold as fuck during the morning and by noon, it was 75....I get it!
Oh. My. God. Some point during the beers part my mouth dropped open when I realized what happened.
Too many redirects. 
Chiefs do play Denver twice in their season, so I really don't know how to feel about that. Where as the Bengals have a wayyyyy easier schedule, I'm still leaning towards the chiefs though. I might just put in a waqiver wire and if I get them then I get them. If not, oh well.
Or just take the ACT since most schools only take the ACT now. Unless you want to go to a east-coast school or a school that specifically requires the SAT, I wouldn't waste my time preparing for and taking an SAT. A quick [google search](http://collegeapps.about.com/od/standardizedtests/tp/sat-act.htm) will help you decide what will best suit your needs.

Yes, and I used it as an excuse to stay with her for two of the three years until I had enough of her emotional abuse and ended it for good.  If it weren't for that suicide "attempt" I would have been gone sooner.  edit:  I was on my phone when I responded and realized that my response may seem insensitive.  I certainly can appreciate that being sexually abused as a kid can cause a number of problems.  The point when I knew I had to leave was when my mental well being was becoming seriously compromised, and she was doing nothing to deal with her issues.  Good luck to you.

*@Nashville - March 22, 20011:*  "Citrus" by Asobi Seksu is probably my favorite shoegaze album of that decade.  All the songs are top notch and hit the right notes at the right times.  I don't know if I can say I have a favorite, but if I had to pick a few favorites, "Strings" (as posted here) would be in that list.  I caught them performing at The End in Nashville (after we had some delicious sushi at a wonderful place just down the street).  It was a nice intimate space for a band like A.S., and it was also ear-blisteringly loud, but in a good way.  Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance.  I drove 4-5 hours round-trip and don't regret a second of it.  
See you in a few decades then?

So... yes?
&gt;by far Strong claim!  &gt;Which lift ( split or squat) jerk has a higher probability of success ?  For most lifters, the split jerk does.  &gt;Does the slim margin of error on the squat outweigh the depth you can reach!  Probably.  &gt;What about the stability of the split jerk?  It's superior!  But more seriously, those are very strong conjectures you're putting out. Remember, the split snatch turned into the squat snatch because height of the pull was a very important factor in the Snatch. More so than balance, so squat out-did split. On the other-hand, jerks don't require as much height as a clean, or snatch, so it's a different story. The "idea" is, the weight you could clean, you could drive up to split jerk height, at least for general population. So, because height of the bar is not as valuable in jerk, oppose to balance, trading it off for the squat style instead of the split may not happen.  *May* being a very important, key word.

I usually shop on Pccasegear.  However after looking at a few of these other ones I wish I knew they existed before, I did not find them bad at all. The best part about them is the volume of products they have that differs from what pccasegear has. I knew MSY existed but in my experience MSY has the right price but the wrong attitude, I went there to get a new Graphics card the other day and when I had to exchange it, it took them 2 hours to run an exchange had to exchange because it was for my mini ITX box and the card they tried to sell me had 3 prongs which wouldn't fit in my case, they had no issue with the exchange but the fact that they had no idea how to process it was confusing as hell and that it takes so long to get service from their canberra store.  so I lined up for 25-30 minutes initially then I had to come back and line up again (I walked to my car realised my part was wrong and walked back in) then had to wait another hour while they were trying to figure out how to run the exchange, and rather than just asking me to pay the $28 difference for the new crard they charged me the full price then gave me cash in return. So I have been turned off them for a while plus the store used to be layed out better (in my opinion) because you could walk around and pick up the pieces which you want, I.E. they had the things on shelves but now they have it all behind so I can't even go in have a sticky spend my time looking at the parts which I might want to buy then choose to buy them, I now have to go in knowing exactly what I want before I go in. (bear in mind that I am only going based on my experience with MSY in Canberra)   Sorry for the rant guys.

She sounds like many other Chinese girls I have known.  And her saying people are talking shit about her - well, that's not completely unfounded since that's what most Chinese people do anyway.  They play the victim to get what they want.  That said mental illness is largely ignored in China.  There's a kid in one of my classes who clearly has mental issues, he's incapable of doing anything in any of the classes, not just mine.  The Chinese teachers have told me not to ask him anything and the other kids can't stand being paired with him.  I had to find out by myself that he's got a screw loose as no one gave me any indication of his concerns.  So why is he in the school?  Because his dad is part of the growing middle class and lays a load of money on the desk and says 'Nothing wrong with my boy, he's the same as all the others'.  And the headmaster says 'Yes sir' and puts the cash away.
That's funny, you're mom responded to an add I posted on craigslist with the exact same title.
&gt; Perhaps, but by 1930 the Allies were actively working out a progression by which Germany would eventually re-militarize the Rhineland anyway, in return for joining the League of Nations and agreeing to revised restrictions on their armed forces.  Do you have a source for this? I thought the whole point of the Treaty of Versailles, from the French point of view at least, was to cripple Germany for as long as possible.  &gt; The main frustration of the Allies at the time of remilitarization was that they had lost what they had planned to negotiate away to curry diplomatic favour.  can you explain this in more depth? Shouldn't violation of the Treaty be sufficient as casus belli?
I got one referring to a thread with pictures of my hands asking to see more pictures of my hands, in slightly sketchy English. This is odd, since I've never posted any pictures of myself.

More or less. If she's in front of my then the leash usually goes over one of her shoulders when she tries to jump, and it just keeps her from doing so. Really nifty. Taught her not to chase squirrels while on the leash as well after she got flipped over a few times by it. 
Are you telling me that the gun *won't* go off when it is unloaded, with the safety on without pulling the trigger? Whoah!   Its a good safety rule. People think it is okay to be reckless as long the safety is on. Its not. The people around you will both feel safer and BE safer if you treat your weapon as what it is. A dangerous lethal weapon.   This doesn't mean you can't touch or be near guns. Just don't treat them like toys.
I used to intern at Experian, can't say its true that they live in that area. A lot of them were actually over in Charlestown and Beacon Hill.

In high school,  the football team threw a little party at another players house when his parents were gone. One guy walked home drunk and his parents caught him.  His dad showed up and the kids whose house it was and I opened the door. Half the team was there,  including the "stars" and "golden boys". Since we were the only two that were seen, we took the bullet. If we hadn't then half the team would have been suspended and the reputations of all the "golden boys" would have been tarnished. They got what was coming to them; the kid that got caught ended up getting busted with coke and having a kid. Eventually word got out about the goody two shoes really being scumbags. But at the time I was swimming shit Creek. It didn't help that I was labeled the party druggy punk ass kid that everybody else's kids should stay away from. Senior year was rough after that, but at least I still gotta play ball.   To Mike, Zachary, and Hunter. You fuckers are welcome

**[iam_sancho2](http://para.ms/reus/iam_sancho2)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1nfw5r/a/cciiiqf/?cci9ui7)  There is also no "evidence" of chemicals *not* being sprayed. In fact, if you bother to look at all of your old photographs, the persistent, spreading "contrails" of today simply are not in your old photographs. The contrast between the way the skies looked on an average day before and after the turn of the century means it is more likely that something is being sprayed that is a **classified** project (i.e. ~ you aren't important enough to inform). The fact that many of the planes do not show up on flight tracking software further supports the theory that spraying is taking place, rather than the natural conditions for contrail formation changing.

Simple answer: No and no.  Complex Answer: Try both cases("No and no" and "Yes and yes") for any scenario and tell me how much of a difference it makes. Then there's the option of letting Quote shoot down incoming missiles for energy points, as he usually can in Cave Story, with a few exceptions, which seems simple, but adds a layer of active defense to Quote's side it may be a pain to factor into the match.  Meta Answer: The previous threads stipulated that Quote was immune to energy loss by injury, and the arms barrier is in his inventory in this match as a compromise between the two(it halves energy lost to attacks). I removed it from this matchup because the longer your setup paragraph(s) is/are, the fewer responses you get.

I appreciate your honest response. I'm not very familiar with many news anchors (I get most of my information from the internet, because I don't have cable and antenna signals are zilch in my area) so he may be a better guy than I expect. My views of Fox come mostly from when I go to extremist family member's houses and the few times I see it at work on the TV they have outside our elevators in the lobby. My problem is probably that I am mostly liberal. I don't mean to assume this, but I swear they are the ones who use "liberal" as a dirty word judging by what I've seen from them and their viewer's habit of having no clue what the word means (along with other words like socialism and communism). I just feel like everything they ever say is extremely right-wing, and that makes me furious not only because I don't agree with it, but because it's not news. It's opinion. Left wing stations are just as guilty and I stand by my opinion there too... an even better reason to get my info from the internet. You are right however that I shouldn't judge the guy based on the company he works for.

Well, I've got some cheery news for you then!  This is wrong.  Yes, we are made out of atoms.  But they aren't "mostly empty space".  The Bohrs model of an atom being a [nucleus with little spherical electrons whizzing around like planets in orbit around the sun](http://visual.merriam-webster.com/images/science/chemistry/matter/atom.jpg) was wrong. This has been known for quite some time, but for some reason we keep teaching kids the wrong thing, and then maybe correcting it later.   Electrons aren't little spheres. They don't have a well-defined location.  [This](http://sdsu-physics.org/NaturalScience100/znatsci_images/electron_cloud2.gif) would be a better way to visualize an atom.

Larry David left after season 7 and he was a huge part of why the show was so good. If you watch 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' you can easily see how it's similar to seasons 1 through 7 of 'Seinfeld' but 8 and 9 just dont even compare. They offered Jerry 5 million per episode for the 10th season so I guess he thought it was time to leave as well. I'd agree that the show peaked around season 5 or 6.
That right there might be the very best way to describe it.

I hate arguing when I don't totally disagree with the opponents core point.  They absolutely are all douches.  However I feel this was extra douchey.  Both sides added this was the worst economic crisis since the depression in a time when the world is in an economic crisis.  It's the difference between gambling your paycheck away and gambling your family's savings, house, car, and youngest child.  
Well, is he actively wanting to explore physically hooking up with a man? I am the bisexual female in my relationship, and for me it's currently way more important to me to be able to talk about my preferences and curiosities and "ooh she's hot" than it is to actually go nuzzle against some boobs.  I am happy so far to keep it at a fantasy level.  However, my boyfriend and I are discussing the possibility of having a threesome with a girl.  Any experimentation I do with women must strictly include him in order to feel comfortable and involved in my sexuality.  Good for you for being aware that it isn't a rejection of you or that he isn't attracted to you!  I wish you the best of luck!

I've never done McSwiggan's specials, but 10th and Willow has wing night on Monday. $5 at the door gets you all you can eat wings, with a two drink minimum. They usually have drafts of some domestic beer for $2 on wing nights though, so you get a solid meal and beer for about $10. 
I think we agree more than we disagree.  To avoid cognitive dissonance, the mother goes into denial.  Fair enough. When I say it is a case of cognitive dissonance, I'm pointing out cognitive dissonance is "The root" of the problem (as one redditor pointed out).  Denial is a solution to avoid cognitive dissonance. AS this video points out, cognitive dissonance can be...uncomfortable.  And denial is one way to avoid this discomfort.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzVxsYzXI_Y

There is evidence in non-REM sleep (i.e. unconsciousness, but without anesthesia) that the brain takes in stimuli and the area of the brain dedicated to the processing of those stimuli is activated in a similar pattern to that of an awake brain. However, researchers found that the usual patterns of communication between that specific area and other information processing areas are absent.   This find suggests that neither the eyes nor the brain 'shut-off,' rather the information is processed, but not shared with the rest of the brain.   As other users have commented, the specific effects of different drugs vary, but this may be a useful way to understand what is going on.

That's the thing, Freeman appears to have ZERO character. It means you can make him what you want and do whatever you want to do with him without facing the consequences of being 'out' of the story as it portrayed as a great guy when you were a dick. However by doing this give away a large amount of emotion and storytelling. It's a trade-off, that in this case- paid off. However, in some games I feel it did not pay off.
Never really thought of it like that, I'm always just covering the break anyway. I can switch between auto/manual without an issue, minus the floor smash for the missing clutch. 
Not really a topper but a good one to read about is MSgt Scott C. Fales. He was a PJ and at the Battle of Mogadishu. Strangely enough though they didn't portray him in the movie.
Ha! This is so me! I sit in the car checking my email (using the wifi I can pick up from the house), redditing, paying bills, and whatever else I feel like doing.

&gt; Linux is lightweight, can be as low-level as you want, and isn't bloated. This means performance gains.  As I understand it: In Valve's initial ports to Linux, Linux was initially slower than Windows. They've worked hard to fix driver issues and graphics libraries (SDL) to make it faster than Windows. They're making additional performance gains by hacking (improving) the kernel, which is possible because of Linux's openness.

Well I know what I would say, but there are some books that I've learned to keep my opinions of to myself to avoid an unnecessary headache so I probably wouldn't.  I like them, and that's enough for me.
Yeah except that it's been shown a few times to not be inflationary and even if it was it would only to be the extent of the extra pay given (Not to the total cost of an item). So those at the bottom would have more buying power and because those at the bottom tend to spend all the money they get it tends to actually drive economic growth. More money to those at the top only slows economic growth (they tend not to spend the extra they get) and tends to raise the need for expensive government programs. No matter how you end up slicing this, pay people below living wages at best does nothing for the economy and most likely slows it, meanwhile paying more to the bottom always improves economic growth.

I'm not thinking the participant would choose their method of near-death exposure (that'd be too easy for them to recognize).  The agency would decide how to go about it.

Percentages look okay but I think you be better off dropping the Phoenix and making the Archmage a level 3 to run a 750 list; IMHO you don't have enough boots on the ground for a 1000 point list as any reasonably shooty army is going to see your Swordmasters, Reavers and Phoenix off of the board before they can do much of anything.   I know you don't have any more models just yet so scaling back your points total will make your games the most fun. If you're dead set on running this list just bare in mind that 1 miscast is all it takes to see in excess of 25% of your points go up in smoke.
Ooo fancy *laughs*
Where are you getting this information?  How do you have *any* idea of the religious affiliation of the million-plus visitors to Auschwitz?  I am directly calling bullshit that you have *any* factual data to back up your statement.  And ... Look up U.S. states by income. ... Look them up by the GDP per capita, etc.  That region of my country has an abhorrent history.  I have told you several times that it means something different to me than it does to you, and that you just don't understand.  It is getting clearer and clearer to me: you ... don't ... get ... it.  *That* is of absolutely no surprise to me either.  I am fully aware that white people don't know what it means to be black in this country.  You never will.  Oh, but you have a black friend.  Never mind.  You *must* get it.  And he's gay!  Good job.  Double whammy with that one.  And his partner is Asian?  Well, that's just the trifecta now, isn't it? ... Black isn't contagious.  It doesn't just transfer like that.  I am ashamed of that part of my country.  I am ashamed of it's history.  I am ashamed of it's ... lackadaisical performance in all measured areas.  I am older than your average Redditor, but 1965 wasn't *that* long ago.  That was barely a generation ago, so ... what do you think happened to all of the people that were alive then?  Nobody around you voted against Civil Rights?  Really?  Was that all in the other county over? ... The South still has a lot to apologize for, and it is looked down upon for good reason.

"I'm so sorry that you're part of our "club". Lyme Borreliosis is a prison I know all too well. You're feeling worse because the bacteria is dying and releasing those toxins more quickly than usual. It gets much worse before it gets better, I'm afraid. This is actually an excellent indicator that you have a lyme infection. You will be 100% again with proper treatment."  ------  For OP: this is known as the herxheimer reaction. I can't verify much of the rest of it as I think those are brand names outside of the U.S. (but it sounds like the right approach). I'll second the spreadsheet idea, but unfortunately, it's unlikely that I'll ever be 100% well from this (too many years spent un-diagnosed/untreated)--but it is approaching a very manageable state of maintenance, and honestly ANYTHING is an improvement, amirite?!

Woo, those are some simple questions with not so simple answers :) it's very hard to describe Druidry because it's different for everyone. It has no rules or requirements except a love and respect for nature. You do not have to believe in gods or goddesses, karma or an afterlife or reincarnation. It is all up to preferences of the individual. Different organizations and groves will sometimes have moral guidelines, but there is no large overlaying sort of code of conduct. People may have altars if they wish, they may worship gods or goddesses or only one god or goddess or none at all, they can follow whatever culture for influence they like, they can celebrate whatever holidays they like (though most do follow the 8 Sabbats). Some believe in and practice magic, some do not. It's whatever feels right for you.  This is a very good blog article that I think accurately describes the basic mentality of Druidry and most Druids http://philipcarrgomm.wordpress.com/2013/09/19/does-god-exist-and-the-crowning-achievement-of-druidry/  These are also some good sites to view:  http://druidnetwork.org/what-is-druidry/  http://www.druidry.org/druid-way/what-druidry  Some people who need a bit more structure to their spiritual practices will mix Druidism with other religions, such as other Pagan religions (like Wicca or Arastu), or even Abrahamic religions like Christianity
Well, as far as farces go, it was okay. I just didn't appreciate feeling like I'd been played for a fool. Of course, if you read the original novel, you would have expected it to be a joke. I seriously wished the material had been treated in a more more serious manner. It could have been an interesting premise.

Not as interesting as the others on here and doesn't contain deaths. I finished college one day (brit) and I got on a bus to go home, im about 17 here btw. The seats were not singled out so instead of this: l__l__l they were like this: l____l. The bus is packed and the only seat left is next to an Indian man who looks like he's in his late 20's sporting a grumpy look and using his legs to take up 20% of my consensual 50% leaving me with 30% to rest my weary legs. I decided to not be phased by his bad manners (stiff upper lip) and tried to take full advantage of my seating situation. Yeah my leg was kind of pressed up against his but its not gay if its petty. So my asian brother starts shooting me mean looks I can see out the corner of my eye. I turn to my right, he had a window seat, and I sort of shoot off a puzzled look with a "hmm"? He replies "vat are you doing?" I reply "fuck you". He uses his right hand to attempt to punch me in my cocky teenage face but fails. I grab his right hand with my left as if we were playing mercy and posture up to rain hellfire on his face. After a few seconds I heard a pop, saw I drew blood from his face and let go and backed off. His left hand immediately grabbed his right hand where his middle finger was was snapped in one place and just hanging there. He then turned his head to look out of the fucking window miserably as if I'd just divorced him. Any impact on my life is probably positive. Stand up for yourself and all that good stuff.

ok, the o2 sensor value shouldn't cause huge drivebility issues in the short term. You could unplug the harness and see if that affects anything. I would assume that it wouldn't, if it's already gone bad. In any case, I'd suggest replacing the sensor. They tend to go bad after about 100k mi, I think.  Lambda fault code might be related to the o2 sensor, but I'd assume that you are tripping that code due to unburned fuel from misfires. This is a symptom, not a cause. I would still start at the ignition system. Do what the code book tells you:   &gt;Start the car and let it run for 30 seconds; Turn off car and let it sit for another 30 seconds; Perform diagnostic test again; If the same flash code re-appears DME should be replaced  If it really is bad, a DME isn't that expensive from a forum like r3vlimited. Maybe 40-50 bucks for a stock 173.   one last thing...how badly carboned were your plugs before you cleaned them? You might be running a rich air/fuel mixture over a long period of time due to the bad o2 sensor. That would cause build up on your plugs, eventually causing a misfire. Like I said before, swap in brand new plugs and see what happens. It could be that you don't actually need a new coil, but rather your plugs are so badly fouled that it is causing a weak spark and misfires under load. 
"the ratings mean many viewers met walter white for the first time in his last episode"  That statement made no sense. Just because more people saw this episode live doesn't mean the difference between that and other episodes watched live are people who hadn't ever watched the show before that episode.

I didnt pay the farmhand directly for picking the apple I ate this morning, and yet I can say with confidence I paid for the apple. THe price I paid at the register contains the previous prices of the steps along th way.  I did not pay the land owners for right-of-ways for the power line, but I most certainly paid the power company.  I didnt pay for the road, but I paid a gasoline tax that goes to build it.   In the absence of a gasoline tax I'd pay a toll, or a membership fee, or I'd find an alternative mode of transport.   When prices are too high, people find alternatives.  Its call substitution effect, and it happens in economics all the time.  There is nothing magical about government in its ability to create services.  We dont need government to organize our supermarket shelves... and yet we get perishable food from all over the world, organized neatly and cheaply in our neighborhood stores.

I have read it and it doesn't actually say that, although those that rely on more than one news source do tend to be better informed. Sometimes one of those sources may be Fox. What I did find most interesting is that among those that relied on a single source, the Daily Show viewers were better informed than the Fox Viewers, but not better informed than those that watched no news at all.  And at this point, I would like to bring up an interesting anecdote (for the funny) related to this story when it was reported by Fox; they claimed that it was biased because of the university where it was produced. However, the university did not actually do the study, just a think tank located near it but not actually a part of the university. Thus demonstrating that Fox reporting does, in fact, tend to leave its viewers misinformed. It is also interesting to note that someone fairly high up at Fox News graduated from that university.

In fact, look at the children, especially teenagers and see how many of them are overweight or obese.  I don't think their lives will be very long.

In creating adversaries, you want to portray them with their "ugliest" features severely pronounced; a caricature of a stereotype. You need your people to see them as less than human.   Look at your enemy. Pick a facial feature that differs from your own. Exaggerate to comedic effect.

He keeps changing his story to invoke more outrage and sympathy, even if it is a blatant lie. 
Thankfully the "not going to tank this boss until you commend" problem won't happen. The posts says that you vote after clearing the content. The worst that can happen is that someone doesn't roll for the item at the end. Which could waste 5 mins max. Not a huge inconvenience.

You haven't even mentioned what kind of mechanics the game will use, so it's really hard to say anything useful.  It really depends on the rest of the game.

I think it's dependent on the atmosphere the band provides. If it's a singer/songwriter playing quiet acoustic music, obviously it's rude to talk and be loud. If it's a loud, high-energy show, then being loud is more permissible, and in fact encouraged. When I play shows, that's the dynamic I like, and it makes it more fun when the audience buys into whatever you're playing at the moment. We're trying to communicate something to you, and your volume level lets us know if we're getting through. The whole cell phone photographer/videographer thing is never OK, though. It's cool to snap a picture or two, but then just put the thing away, please. I've never heard anyone yell something like "Go Spurs!", but that's another one for the "never OK" column. Who does that?

In all honesty, the best pictures I've taken with a smartphone camera in a while are with an HTC One, and it has a lowly 4.3 megapixel camera (with their weird-to-smartphones but ancient-to-digital multi CCD tech).  So yeah, it is totally about the sensors. If you *need* a picture that's thirteen megapixels for whatever you are doing, what you need is a digital camera and not your smartphone.
I went to Parker's a few months back as I side swiped a parked vehicle.  I had to get both passenger door panels replaced on my 2001 Civic. They did a great job, you can't even tell they have been replaced.  I went there on a recommendation from my Dad as he took his RSX there after being rear ended. I knew nothing about repairs as I'd had a clean driving record up to this point and they handled all the details for me. Best of luck!

Yup.  Jeb did the same thing on my first Mun landing except only the ascent stage got knocked loose and slid off so slowly that Jeb had time to run around to the other side and try to bump it back into place only to have it flip upside down and land on him pinning him down on his back while Bill stood over him scowling.

Yes, anything positive is an improvement, but for the field of prosthetic we need something revolutionary. The biggest complaint in a prosthetic is weight, and batteries haven't really improved vastly in that area.

To be fair, DV is one of those things that sets off red flags all over the place for gun purchases (For obvious reasons)  Your situation was idiotic and they need to fix their criteria for at what point a DV case should throw up a flag for a gun purchase (I'm not sure where I would personally want that to be. Too many DV victims refuse to cooperate with police with terrible results)

Around here, the deer are so plentiful that you could do the signal any time and you'd still be correctly warning other riders.   Elsewhere, I'm not sure there's really a need since the population is low, and the deer seem to get away from the road pretty quickly after they pass. 
Do you have DDR2 or DDR3 ram?  That's one of those transitional motherboards that has 2 DDR2 slots and 2 DDR3 slots. Also, do you know what model the processor is?  If it's an AM3 processor you can inexpensively replace the motherboard.  It is probably either your ram, or your motherboard.  If it was possible to install the ram in another computer and test it out, that would help narrow it down.  The 80 gig drive is probably broken.  The windows 7 key is good.  You can download a Windows 7 ISO [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/xd44g).  Once you download it you can either just burn it to disk or follow the procedure on that link to install it in a USB flash drive.  Make sure you get the 64 bit version of whatever license (home premium, professional, etc) is specified by the sticker.

What is dropping a bomb on someone? Killing seems like the primary goal there.  For a majority of missions I'm sure it's just nice stuff like build a school or build a bridge.  But to say that killing people is always a secondary goal seems a little silly.  Or you just mean it's a means to an end.  Capture that hill, neutralize that enemy force.  But we all know what neutralize means.  It's always a success when the enemy surrenders without a shot fired, but the reality is you expect to kill someone.

I was going to ask if it's not to rude. You seem like a pretty young guy so I have to wonder how you afford a car like that. Did you buy it used and they're way cheaper on the used market than I realized? Or just ultra good income?
Yes but it's unwise to view it as a black or white, 0 or 1 approach.  Sorry to Godwin you, but the Nazis built amazingly rigid structures and were able to accomplish quite a bit economically speaking. They of course had the dirty nasty stuff inside them that we all do, and projected it out. The real tragedy of understanding them is not to say that what they did wasn't abhorrent &amp;mdash; it was &amp;mdash; but to think that *we're so different with OUR structure* and not to realize that we easily can red tape away some of the biggest atrocities in the history of mankind.

&gt;The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They **enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong** and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.  Contrast:  &gt;The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands. They have forgotten Allah , so He has forgotten them [accordingly]. Indeed, the hypocrites - it is they who are the defiantly disobedient.

With very little exception, ALL of the wholesalers (Priceline, Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.) get the same price. I worked in reservations/front desk/concierge/PBX for years and it was the same routine every day - you send out the same damn prices for ALL the companies. More likely than not, if the hotel is listed on multiple websites, none will have a better rate than the others.   But to add to that, you can almost always get a better rate by calling the hotel directly and talking to a person who works on-site. This was 100% true for me in Scottsdale, AZ, with the exception of peak (Roughly the beginning of January through the middle of May, but that's because we were primarily golf suites and hosted a lot of large groups for BCS, Phoenix Open, the Arabian Horse Show and then spring training, in addition to large golf groups. I would wager that a lot of AZ resorts don't have as long of an "in season").  Reservations agents that are in-house are generally given carte blanche in regards to giving shit away. We were constantly told that we could do "whatever was necessary to fill rooms"... within reason.   Don't be a dick, of course, but low-balling your game by $20 or $30 will probably get you a cheaper rate than you'll see online.
All I could think was "The Americans look awfully asian"...

Little boys are amazing though.  My first was a boy and I absolutely can't imagine him being a girl.  You get to do cars, and trains, and dinosaurs and all the fun stuff like building forts and stuff.  I mean, you can do that with a girl too, but when your son picks up a dead lizard, it's pretty awesome. LOL I also grew up around boys, so, I guess that's why I love my little boy.  I'm hoping for a little girl this go around, but I'm okay with another boy too.  Grieve if it's a boy, but I think you will get your little girl. :)

This is a cute true story about Ron Miller, son-in-law to Walt Disney.  Ron was part of the leadership team who helped launch the Florida Project.  For the two weeks prior to Walt Disney World's soft opening in 1971, Miller was in Japan, already laying the groundwork for Tokyo Disneyland.  As a result, he almost missed the soft opening.  Coming over from the airport in the helicopter around 7 a.m., Ron noticed a line of bumper-to-bumper traffic on the one road heading into the property.  Thinking he'd missed a memo, he radioed the corporate office saying this "Hey guys, did I miss something?  This was supposed to be a soft opening, 500 invitations.  I got nothing but traffic here."    Realizing for the first time the scope of what they'd done in that swamp in Florida, he heard this reply, "Boss, those aren't people coming to the opening.  Those are your employees trying to get to work."   --This story was told to me one night at dinner by Russ Weis, GM of the Disney family winery, Silverado.
alright thanks!

Man, I ask for a factual response and I get the common MJ nostalgia. It's becoming obvious to me that MJ lover's use a lot of cliche's, and have a huge lack of understanding about what basketball actually is. MJ is a better scorer than Lebron (albeit only 2 more points per game with about 3 more shots per game). But what else does MJ do better than Lebron than scoring? To say MJ is better than Lebron because he consistently scores 2 more points per game on 3 shot's is idiotic. Lebron is a far better facilitator, and versatile defender.

Sigh.  More poor quality journalism at Coindesk.  They continue to cite a really old interview with coblee that misinterpreted "small transactions like a meal" for ideal for microtransactions.  It is quite the opposite, Litecoin is quite hostile to microtranactoins.  The behavioral fee disincentive again for all outputs that are below 0.01 in value.  One of Litecoin's core goals is efficiency.  If you ran a business, would you waste your accountant's time tracking millions of transactions a thousandth or millionth of a dollar in value?  It makes no sense for everyone to bear the costs of storing these many meaningless microtransactions in a global ledger forever.  Litecoin is NOT for microtransactions.  If you want microtransactions you either want an offchain tx processor or another alt coin.  For example, Bitcoin is a good choice for microtransactions with many recipients.

Alright if the developer(s) are in this thread, can I just ask you for one thing? I totally understand that this might not be feasible, but have you considered creating a small Windows program that would run in the background and hook into the windows context menu to give us the option of right clicking and selecting "push to device"? The program would then do everything else in the background for you, no website required.  I believe that would be the simplest way of pushing stuff to our devices. Thank you anyway for creating such an awesome app!

When I was 14 my 13 yo brother (cousin, but we spent every weekend together) was hit by a car and died. A month later my parents get divorced, and a month later my mom, little brother, and I moved, a month later I started high school. I look almost identical to my mother and (I think for that reason) my dad was an absolute dick to me. He would take my brother to do stuff, he would ignore my phone calls, just be an absolute shit head until I finally called him up one day and told him to go fuck himself.   Fast forward to my last semester of college: My dad and I talk often, he comes and visits, pays for some stuff of mine, he's really trying.   Secret: I hate him for treating me like shit. I can't get over it. I know at this point it's stupid to still be mad but no matter what I just really want to scream at him and tell him how terrible of a father he was and what a pathetic excuse of a man he is. So although I tell him I love him, I really wouldn't care if he dropped dead. I would just hope he leaves me a lot in his will. 
&gt; actual facts  .
but I do think you missed the point made in the article (and the reason I shared it)  whoch is that if you make a good game that people are willing to pay for,  rather than build in a naggy. iap,  trust in your game because the customers will tell friends which will lead to higher returns. in the end.  People are way burnt out on iaps.  Even Apple is behaving that way. To me it cheapens a game's stock.

There are lots of laws that don't sound good to me already, you don't need to invent new ones.  It's just part of being a citizen.  There are ways to change the bad laws.  What grinds my gears is elections where you only need more votes than the next guy, not a majority... those keep the two party system firmly in place, and I don't like that, and it would be EXTREMELY hard to change that since the only people who can change it are the ones who are exploiting it.

Every month it's exactly the same thing with /r/gaming. Flavor of the month is released, everyone is excited, posts about it, enjoying sharing the experience.

I live 3500 miles away in California now and I haven't been home for years, but I knew exactly what intersection you were talking about before clicking the article. 
I remember listening to this when I was about 11 or 10
It had many many other issues that lead to that failure that TESO / Zenimax do not have to deal with.  top of that list is hundreds of tiny servers with ZERO mechanic to move players around as populations elasticize. TESO has megaservers with no such issues... that alone puts it in a who nother ball park.  Has SWTOR had that, and a content pipeline that didnt suck and not been pressured by retarded EA execs to go to market early, it might have been a completely different story.  the game as it sits today is pretty stellar.
German. I'm a native German and literally every sound in Japanese exist somehow in German. You know that shit people tell you about the う and that it sounds like the oo in English? Not at all. It's literally the German ü a bit more in the direction of ö (both vowels so going into the "direction of ö" is easy). え? Well, that's an ä. Sure there are minor differences but the sounds map quite well.  Same for Swedish (u and ä), Norwegian (u and æ) and many other Germanic languages.  So Norwegian would be a simple languages (especially if English is still mandatory) with pretty similar sounds that would give a good basis for many other Germanic languages (like German since many Japanese companies have their European HQ in Düsseldorf) without stressing out the students too much (you want to have something useful after all, right?)
Good thing Wisconsin busted all those unions, we all know the Wal-mart union is responsible for these skyrocketing taxpayer costs for their employees.
Hey bro, congrats on the update and making the wife happy.   Look at and remember your former self in shame and horrendous regret of a life you were formerly living each time you are feeling weak and think you could fail, you'll never touch your dick again.  See you ate 90 bro, keep going strong.
Does it happen if you disable RES? Sometimes scripts running can cause this.
Size probably doesn't matter that much as long as speeds and everything match, and the pins are correct. I've had issues in the past mixing brands and sticks though, it's always best to have matching like the original Patriot.  With that said, you can try 1 stick at a time to see if one of them are dead.
Almost as costly?  &gt; annual cost per inmate was $167,731 last year — nearly as much as it costs to pay for four years of tuition at an Ivy League university.  For the same amount of time it is nearly four times as much.
No way- a former employee saying bad things about their former employer?  Shock journalism!
sorry, but a repost.
Xross wars. Apparently it's been dubbed, called Digimon Fusion and released recently. I'm watching the sub though.
And don't forget the Ice Hunter arc, that one was about as long as G-8 too.

Never heard of this before. I'm gonna have to try it out after I finish playing through the last three /newstuff .wads. (I got pretty lazy with my DooMing.)

They *do* do an extra arm day with their feet, though.
The biggest issue I see, are the members who choose to bank in only fiat, these funds will be converted into Bitcoins and as we have seen bitcoin is extremely volitale, the only way this strategy will work is if bitcoin continues up slowly without too much flucuation. If bitcoin drops 50% in a day (not unlikely) and someone with substantial holdings cashs out on that very day, the bank will either need to cover this until bitcoin rises, or sell at a lose. I'm not saying people will cash out during the flucuations but it is highly likely that this will occur.  Other than this, why would anyone be willing to deposit funds into a bank that converts their Cash(Stable) into bitcoins(risky) to safe guard their funds? I see this as a silly proposition, it would be like me offering that I will hold their cash and invest it in exploration mining stocks, and then saying don't worry if this doesn't pan out your money is safe.  If bitcoin steadily rises and they gain enough backing they will be fine, if it drops heavily in the first year of adoption this venture will most likely fail. Just my 2 cents
&gt; DID YOU EVEN READ THE ARTICLE?  I live in Finland you jackass and the way you describe it is not how it works AT ALL.   That quote is very poorly constructed and you simply don't have any clue how this system actually works. Until you do, there really is nothing to talk about.  Look at those figures again for a start.   Why is basic maths so difficult for you people?  &gt; In America, people on minimum wage make $5 to $9 per hour. At that rate, the parking ticket would be $400-700 dollars. You fucking what?!?!? A parking ticket is 40€ for everybody. It's a fixed ticket.  You need to do a serious infraction to go into day-fines.   Your logic is so backwards it's unbelievable.   Why is this so goddamn difficult? 
The thing is though, this is for people who are working primarily in the terminal, so it's open all the time. If you just open CMD as admin and leave it running, you could easily forget that you're running an unsafe admin command.  If you go the other route and open a normal, restricted-access terminal, whenever you try to run an admin command you get reminded, and then you can just quickly sudo to repeat the command, and then you're back to restricted mode afterwards. So this method gives you more safety and convenience—you can't accidentally make admin changes, and you don't have to keep manually point-and-clicking "Run as administrator" to open new terminals.  If you're happy just leaving an admin terminal open though, go for it :)

A wifi hotspot receives a 3G signal from the tower, then outputs a wifi signal that you can connect to like any other access point. A "3G mobile stick" I'm assuming is a USB 3G modem (like the AT&amp;T Beam), which receives a signal from the tower, then passes it directly to your computer.   If you have a tablet or a non-Windows operating system, you're going to want the mobile hotspot. If you're carrying a Windows laptop, then the USB modem is going to run off of your laptop's power rather you having to watch it's battery level.   That aside, there's the issue of your plan. Buying a device month-to-month is going to cost a healthy amount up front (since there's no hardware subsidy), while buying a plan is going to add up over time (or slap you with a cancellation fee). Is there no option to get Internet where you're staying?   Also, consult with the carriers before you leave to make sure you're device will work where you are. Network standards change from country to country, so you will need to know you're on the right standard on the right part of the spectrum (GSM versus HSPA networks and some things that are really not my field). 
That standup was funny, but the whole time I couldn't help but think "speak for yourself." He makes some great points, but for me, I don't enjoy the act as much if she doesn't enjoy it either. I put alot of thought into making sure she is taken care of. Evoking a good reaction makes it more enjoyable for me, plain and simple. It's empowering.
&gt;American football (known as football in the United States and gridiron in some other countries) is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide with goalposts at each end. The offense attempts to advance an oval ball, the football, down the field by running with or passing it. They must advance it at least ten yards in four downs to receive a new set of four downs and continue the drive; if not, they turn over the ball to the opposing team. Points are scored by advancing the ball into the end zone for a touchdown, kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal or by the defense tackling the ball carrier in the offense's end zone for a safety.
I like it!  The exposure is damn near perfect!

A song of ice and fire did have elves, but they all died a very long time before the books came out. As for something more recently released, the witcher has elves in it. Plus, just because something has elves in it, doesn't necessarily make it generic. You may as well say things are generic because they have humans in it.
I did answer it:  &gt;&gt;Why would you want his perspective on anything?  Because:  &gt; Napolitano can provide a lot of insight on what we should be doing now to get our own house in order.
Check out twisted throttle. My buddy has a TR650 and he was showing me their catalog. They've got luggage racks and hand guards and some good stuff for the bike. Although I will say that his engine just blew a few weeks ago while he was riding. Left a nice hole where you can see into the engine. Had to get it shipped off to the nearest Husky dealer so they can verify the problem (still under warranty). Fantastic bike though. Light enough to be an incredibly large dirtbike but can cruise on pavement if needed (get a windshield if you plan on that!).
Unique two-handed staff. It's pretty great for fire builds. I've never found one, but apparently the lower-level ones are fairly cheap.
Sounds like you're both trying, I'm happy for you both. Marriage isn't easy and people give up on it too easily these days. I'm really glad you both decided to work out your issues rather than walk away as soon as things get tough. Good luck to you both, I hope you and your family have great happiness. 
Anyone who thinks Unger being out didn't affect last game isn't playing with a full deck. Centers have shared responsibility for calling line protections and All-Pro centers prioritize who and how to block better than back up centers. I wish I had time to trawl through tape and irrefutably repudiate stuff like this, but instead I'll just have to be annoyed.  Remember that play when Cushing flew in untouched and blasted Marshawn to cause a fumble? Without going back and watching the tape to strengthen my intuition one way or another, there's a good chance Lem was partly responsible for that. The problem is, the center's job is subtle and as fans we can't always pin the failures on him without more information. Nevertheless, when a team loses a starting center in the middle of the season, you'll almost always notice a mysterious drop in offensive efficiency -- a lot like what we saw on Sunday.  http://beta.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2007/01/a_center_shall_lead_them.html  If the drop off in play between Unger and Lem, against by some measures the second best defense in the NFL, is no big deal, we could have saved a lot of money by not extending Unger. Instead we made him one of the highest paid centers in the NFL.

For the love of Christmas don't take 30-50 mg of lope. You're over the worst, fact. Maybe take three (6mg) of Imodium if you need too otherwise by Wednesday or Thursday you'll feel yourself again. You did, however, with your description and all that jazz, nail opiate addiction on the head. So you might wanna nip this in the bud and not do anymore cause surely it can ruin your life. That depression you feel only gets amplified by shame and guilt as time goes on if you continue using.

It's funny.
.. and you are okay with them prioritizing which websites work fast or slow for you based on how much the website pays Verizon?.. you are okay with them trying to destroy the internet (not very slowly either)? They are going to be using the money you are paying them to set a precedent in court that WILL destroy the net.  Ya i stand by my statement.
Really? I always feel like naut's ult moves really fast... but them again, I don't play against many nauts, despite how strong I think he is.  As for nasus, he is very difficult to deal with if he gets ahead, but most of the time, when he starts becoming a huge threat (has 300 q stacks and is tanky as fuck) I'm already on my way to completing LW.
I loved those parts. It was just like an easy free time to cruise for a bit.

&gt; Et quelle conclusions retires-tu de cette étude, exactement ? Tu ne fais que mettre un lien sur la page principale.  I placed that link there so you could read the report for yourself. The reason why is because it is far more relevant than some Belgian statistic or an anecdote from Iran.  If you're too lazy to read the 310-page report, this paragraph sums their finding on visible religious symbols adequately:  «Concernant le port de signes religieux par les agents de l'État: qu'il soit interdit aux magistrats et procureurs de la Couronne, aux policiers, aux gardiens de prison, aux présidents et vice-présidents de l'Assemblée nationale; qu'il soit autorisé aux enseignants, aux fonctionnaires, aux professionnels de la santé et à tous les autres agents de l'État.»  The rationale is that no one who holds coercive power (i.e., violence, imprisonment, etc.) over a citizen should be allowed to wear a religious symbol, and I generally agree with this conclusion.  &gt; Drôle que tu enlève la symbolique religieuse et politique du voile. C'est loin d'être simplement culturel.  I didn't omit it. I thought it was understood. [Like I said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Quebec/comments/1n6gx0/le_multiculturalisme_est_mort_au_qu%C3%A9bec_il_y_a/ccfzhza) to /u/jeannaimard only a few days ago:  &gt; Only an ignoramus would deny the deep link between religion and a people's history and culture.  Religion absolutely affects culture. Don't you agree?
250lbs a panel, plus lightweight construction methods and often difficulties in disconnecting them, or removing them to ventilate hot gas from a house. It makes it very, very dangerous for us.   I actually expect you'll see defensive only attacks on homes with panels on the roof...so think twice.
Haha thanks man :) That actually helped more than you can imagine.
You got some Sansa humor

Wow that was really good and tremendously interesting sounding. Thanks a lot for the post. 
Yes, however we are much more evolved than the bees and therefore we deal with cuddling that is not physical. Much of this cuddling is conveyed through thoughts and body language that the primitive bees would not be able to absorb, therefore they have to resort to cuddling.

Ohh... I'm sorry... How long ago did that happen?
Why shouldn't they have acted like that?
1)Best case scenario, all your files are still there as you think.  1i)OK, a new client will not see the torrents.   1ii)First move all the data (using the FTP client) to where the client expects to see them (e.g. deluge/data or rtorrent/data folders).  1iii)Now reload the torrent files either by a) redownloading them from the sites/ trackers where you got them and adding them to your webui PAUSED or NOT STARTING or b) by moving them (using the FTP client) from wherever they still are, IF they are there, to the watch folder of your new client  (e.g. in rtorrent/torrents to deluge/watch) but with your download speed cut to 1 kb/s so you don't re-download everything by mistake. Option b might be possible if you installed client Y without uninstalling client X or if Client X kept a copy of all the torrent files.  1iv)Then recheck everything if it does not do so automatically. When everything checks to 100% you are good to seed.  2) If data is missing, FTP it up to the data folder of your new client (just like download but the opposite) recheck the torrents and go.  Sorry if this is too ELI5
