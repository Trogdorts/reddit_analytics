So you're saying it's more of a bell cuve in rarity, but possibly exponential in growth, as exponential in such low scales isn't as extreme as log.
Lol. You just got downvoted for a completely legitimate and I assume completely true statement.

There's plenty of ass between the hole and your boxers. Not being mean, but just sayin'.....
No one is saying that they can't say whatever they want.  Its about where they can say it.  Would you want them saying whatever it is that you want them to have the right to say in your living room?  That's the issue, not whether or not they can yell and wave signs, but whether they can do it 2 feet from the coffin and grieving families.
maybe a detector that can detect clocked spies?  a la starcraft.  though putting a detector next to a sentry gun would give a pretty unfair advantage to the engie

I never really decided not to believe in god. When I was very young I said I did, but I don't think it was ever true. Rather, I realized I had always been an atheist when I read the following quote on the internet:  &gt;If God is willing to prevent evil, but is not able to Then He is not omnipotent.  &gt;If He is able, but not willing Then He is malevolent.  &gt;If He is both able and willing Then whence cometh evil?  &gt;If He is neither able nor willing Then why call Him God?  I know there are refutations and debates, but to me it is so clearly laid out; the idea of god makes no fucking sense. Complicated things evolve and form from simple things as defined by physical laws. Why would that pattern, observable in all things, reverse itself once and in the most important circumstances?   I can remember being very young and having the profound sensation that the motions of religion were empty in a fundamental way, and when I was older it would all be explained to me. I still remember how it felt when I realized that grown people take religion seriously. 
AWESOME! No really, I loved that game

Accelerated C++ (by Koenig &amp; Moo) is one of my favorite programming books of any kind. It's only 300 pages, but packs in the essential core of the language. It doesnt require a C background at all, but it wont bore C gurus either. I cant speak highly enough of this book, and it has near-perfect reviews on Amazon.

Email your Representatives.  It is easy.  Click and paste your message to all of them.  Email is the best way as the are automatically directed to the person in charge of the issue.  Write with the following in mind.   "I'm a Senate staffer. Even though my boss isn't on Finance, I'm sitting here in our Dirksen office listening to our poor interns answer a deluge of calls about the public option. Like most offices (including those listed above) we're only keeping track of the opinions of our state's voters. If you care about the public option, you can make a difference right now. Here's the kind of call that would get my attention, be added to my tally, and maybe even flagged to pass to an LA depending on the circumstances: you start by telling me you're from the state and an active voter; you have supported my boss for years and you contributed to our last campaign; you politely but firmly tell me that your vote rides on whether my boss supports a public option. Extra credit for being able to discuss the issue intelligently, providing an in-state address or having your phone number show up as in-state on our caller ID. I'm honestly breaching all sorts of good conduct by telling you this (from work, no less!), but I confess I still care about silly things like good public policy."

I agree, there was half of an interesting point but the writing was so poor that I don't care.
As you rightly point out, consensus doesn't make something true.  Consensus was that the Sun revolved around the Earth, which in turn, was flat. I'll reiterate, big theories that are too big to test in a lab are tested in two ways. * Make predictions  * Get confirmation from other fields Darwin predicted an undiscovered species by looking that the shape of a flower.  Geology and Genetics confirmed his theory.  Prediction and independent field verification. Astronomers theorized galaxies should fly apart based on the speed they're spinning, unless there was about 30% more matter invisible to instrumentation (AKA Dark Matter).  They also make predictions about what will be discovered if various scientific instruments are built.  Physicists require the Universe to have 30% more matter in their theories.  Again, prediction and independent field verification. All of the big theories in science have the same pattern of making predictions, and independently verifying each other.  If another field of science contradicts your theory, or your predictions don't come true, your theory is wrong and needs to be modified. Now lets look at Global Warming.  Global Warming theory predicted catastrophic sea level increases and warming.  Yet sea levels are not changing, and we've entered a cold period.  This failure of the model has caused a public relations action of renaming Global Warming to Global Climate Change. For over 100 years Mankind has been able to predict general temperature trends by looking at solar activity.  The solar indicators predicted the recent cold spell.  Global Warming models did not.  The contradiction requires resolution.  An independent field of science, astrogeology, finds evidence that other planets in the solar system are affected by solar activity just as Earth is. The century old method of measuring Sun spots is confirmed by prediction and independent field validation. Global Warming theory has made **no** predictions that are not made by the traditional Sun spot model, and is contradicted by the Sun Spot theory, and astrogeology. Man made Global Warming is not a scientific theory. http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_ice-age_031208.html  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/06/980625084439.htm

&gt;If you do, you might seem unpatriotic, flag-burning or Californian.  As a California native, I just want to mention this brought a tremendous smile to my face. When I was a sophomore in high-school long ago, on the first day in my first class (AP History) the teacher came in a little late. He stood and scanned the class, waiting for us to all fall silent. As soon as we had, he said: "You are all pinko, commie, faggot scum. I just want you to realize, as Californians, this is how the rest of the country views you."
New news to me, and this is why I come here.  
It's the 2nd amendment that gives the right to bear arms, 1st is free speech.  &gt; That was hundreds of years ago and the frame work for the language and what was going on compared to how the US has evolved since makes the amendment simply out of date as much as it's out of context.  Again, the long list of revolutions conflicts with that. The nation may have evolved, but the mentality of those who usurp our constitution not only continues but grows every year. We lose more and more of our rights every year, and our constitution is strayed from further. It's a right the people deserve to have the tools necessary to deter and combat this, as well as to defend ourselves from others who would do harm against us. Even if you removed guns related murders and crimes from the USA we would still end up with quite a high murder rate over other nations, and it could be assumed that at least 25% of those gun related murders would still occur. People don't pick up a gun and instantly decide to kill, they decide to kill first.  Every day citizens save themselves from becoming victims: http://www.claytoncramer.com/gundefenseblog/blogger.html

No, but i am pissed off when i formulate a well thought out response to something and someone claims i am trying to sound smart.  It isn't bad when the person who claims it isn't adding anything else to the discussion - that you can just ignore.  But when you are having a lengthy and serious debate with someone at least as knowledgeable and articulate as you and they claim that, it can totally derail the conversation while they maintain the appearance of their previous points going unrefuted.
I just finished it for the first time in Spanish (not my native language-probably missed a lot). I never did figure out what exactly religion had to do with most of it.

&gt; The language chosen for open source software should be whatever the author wants, for whatever reason they want. Period.  And when choosing the packages to be included in a distribution, the language used to write the code should be a factor in that decision if use of that language exposes that distribution to risk.   The proof. Here's an extract of a mail exchange where someone asked Miguel what the position was on patents with regard to Moonlight:  &gt;&gt; * What about microsoft patents? If I create my own linux distro or I &gt;&gt; use a distro that is not mainstream or just doesn't have a deal with &gt;&gt; the daemon.. err Microsoft.. like Novell has.. Will I have to suffer &gt;&gt; the shadow of Microsoft patents over Silverlight when using or &gt;&gt; developing Moonlight?  &gt; *Not as long as you get/download Moonlight from Novell which will include patent coverage.*  &gt; Miguel   *Emphasis* is mine.  There's the proof. You cannot ship moonlight in your Linux distribution without incurring patent risk. That same risk applies to anything written using mono.

I'm a firm believer of their being no such thing as "deserve" in sports. There is already a system devised for figuring out who is deserving. That said, I feel that Jensen is blindingly quick when the car is working just so, but he is very weak compared to other top level drivers when it comes to working around a car that doesn't suit what he's doing and I think that's where Rubens' advantage has come from recently.

Sorry don't know. However I do get confused at how the different wings of the major political parties can get away with calling themselves things like "fresh", "change", "real", "unity", etc. Isn't it a bit more honest to just say who you are? Or at least give yourself a title with some credibility rather than a buzzy catch phrase?  I remember a few years back at Melbourne Uni the Libs dressed up and promoted themselves as the green party only to then rip their shirts off to reveal the Liberal logo underneath. The fuckers thought they were so cocky, but the only result was to drive students away from participating in the student union. And look at where we are now...

&gt;I hope you realize that we do not have a single continuous direct observation of the Moon's orbit.  *WHHAAAAAT???*  Just kidding.  Your points are well made and well taken, especially by this former chemistry teacher.  &gt;prove  Yes, a weakly chosen word, mostly in brief haste.  The best "proofs" of any theories are those that are sufficiently predictive (among other things) that they can resist failure when applied to observable phenomena.  A simple example is the *verification* of Einstein's theory of relativity by observing and predicting Mercury's orbit.   Even "tangible" is subjective.  How does one describe the sensation of touch?  Would that best be described as the movement of a sufficient number of skin cells, so that eventually a sufficient number of nerve endings detect the electromagnetic stimulus due to repulsion of their electron clouds (or other such nonsense)?  I generally agree with you.  Thanks for the clarification of your use of Pluto; the use of the concept of time is quite illuminating. :)

I never said ANYTHING about the evils or lack thereof of HFCS. I'm telling you that you are quite wrong when you say they are chemically identical, because although they could be more different, that's not an excuse to say they aren't different.  HFCS is fructose mixed with glucose. Cane sugar is fructose chemically combined with glucose. To extend that analogy to water, that would be like saying, "We're going to substitute water for hydrogen and oxygen [or vice versa]."  There is definitely a taste difference between regular Coke and cane sugar Coke (personal experience, which obviously you do not have). Whether that can be attributed to the taste difference between HFCS and sucrose is unknown to me (and there certainly is a difference).  If there's anything I hate more than people who claim innocuous things are going to kill us all, it's people who don't understand simple, basic chemistry.  EDIT: Since you need chemistry-by-pictures, here is glucose:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/D-glucose-2D-skeletal-hexagon.png  Here is fructose:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/D-Fructose_cyclic.png  And here is sucrose (you can see the 6 and 5 membered rings of glucose and fructose):  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Sucrose_CASCC.png  HFCS is simply the first two molecules swimming around in solution, not combined as they are in sucrose.

Wait a minute, are you taking the position that you are on the side of scientific truth, and yet you defer your mind to polls and to wikipedia?  Give me a break you sophist.  That is not how science works.  Majority opinion nor wikipedia are in any way "credible" methods of truth gathering.  If you are on the side of science, which I very much doubt you are, then you would neither cite popularity polls nor wikipedia.  Furthermore, science does not come from "organizations".  It comes from *individual people* who may or may not be a part of an organization.  The "scientific organizations of any significant standing" of which you are talking about, are either the ones that share your prejudicial biases, and there a LOT of misguided folks like you out there, or they are financed by those who have a vested interest in making people give up their liberties to state power. It is widely known and accepted that all government financed scientists, climatologists in particular, have an incentive to produce results that support the political goals of those who fund their research.  Since over 90% of all climate research is funded by *government agencies*, is it really that surprising to accept that this is the main reason why over 90% of climate research concludes that the government is right about the weather?  You have to have your head really far up your ass if you actually think climate science is not biased to favor governmental goals.   Those scientists that produce results that show mankind is not affecting the planet's weather to any significant degree are almost always stripped of their research grants and funding.  Do you honestly think that over many years, this won't create a "survival of the fittest"  type scenario where only those scientists who are willing, if not consciously but unconsciously, to toe the party line and give the government the intellectual support it needs to expand itself?  Can you not see that those people in government have a personal incentive to make the government larger, because doing so will directly improve their well-being?  The government financed scientists are very much like the government financed intelligence agencies who had a huge incentive to produce "studies" that showed Iraq had WMDs, and that Saddam was linked to the 9/11 attacks.  These are just recent examples.  There are many more.  The point is that the incentives of government paid "researchers" is to produce reports that won't get them fired.  You have to learn a very hard and difficult lesson that *the government is not at all concerned with honesty and truth, it is concerned with furthering its own power and health*.  It is naive and, quite frankly, idiotic, to accept on faith, as you are doing, the research that government finances.  It simply cannot be trusted.  The analysis that the people in the headline link did on the Yamal tree core data PROVES that government financed research simply cannot be trusted at all.  The truth is simply not their goal.  Power is their goal.  The sooner you learn this, the better.
If I recall correctly, there have been more studies done that show that playing violent video games *reduces* the probability of a violent outburst in real life because it gives people an outlet for their anger. Even as a kid I remember one of the campaigns advertised in the gaming magazines was to donate used games/consoles to people with anger management issues and violent pasts so they could take out their violent tendencies in a virtual setting.

I tend to play FF games like I have OCD.   VIII is a very nice game with a good art style, but really all the 'extra' gameplay I could eek out of it was collecting all the cards.  IX I thoroughly enjoyed, but the PAL clock ran too fast (50/60hz) so getting excalibur II was almost impossible to get without missing other items along the way to save time.  X is one of my favourites, the sphere grid system really plays right into my desires for an RPG. Tens of hours of beating up mini-bosses to get upgraded stats? Yes please.  VII of course was groundbreaking. The materia system was superb, still allowing for character stats to be grinded as well. Also, god damn chocobo breeding, hell yea.

1 hour isn't a lot, but it isn't a regular job.  I played 9 tables at a time (easier than it sounds) but the full hour is packed full of strategy, calculations, and decisions. Jam packed.  But it was stressful because of the swings.  No matter how good a player you are, you will go through swings.  Poker is a game where you can only control so much (if you get your money all in preflop with the best possible hand vs the worst possible hand, you're still only an 80% favourite), and law of averages says that during some stretches, nothing will go your way. I've gone on several downswings where i lost 25k over the course of a week.  Also, there are programs out there that will collect your hand histories and actually give you an accurate amount of how "unlucky" or "lucky" you are. I went through another 2 month stretch where I was supposed to win ~50k (meaning that if all the hands i played were ran over and over again, i should be up 50k) but ended up breaking even. Equally as stressful.  But yes, it definitely is a viable source of income.  There are literally thousands of kids around the world that do this for a living, the underground community is downright fascinating.  I could drop down to lower limits and pull out ~4k a month almost guaranteed

The MacBook has a significantly lower grade screen than the MacBook Pro.  It has a thicker grille, lower resolution, and lower DPI.  It's still relatively top of the line for a mid-line laptop screen, but it's not in the same class.  For example, the 17" MacBook Pro is the exact same resolution as the much larger 24" Apple LED display. (1920x1200)  The MacBook Pro's screen is nearly a **quarter** of the size of the desktop display, at the same resolution.  The grille on the MacBook Pro is only barely visible from 6" away.  In comparison to the MacBook, the Pro is far brighter, and the glass cover makes it much easier to see through glares.

This is probably external to the application you wish to write.  &gt; * Rip DVD using VLC &gt; * Use Handbrake CLI to convert all titles over 20 mins (should catch most tv episodes)  Sounds like it can be done in a shell script, AppleScript, or if you need more power, python.  &gt; * Add converted files to tagging queue. &gt; * Scan iTunes for untagged files and add them to the tagging queue.  Not sure how to access the iTunes library, but it is probably also scriptable.  &gt; * Retrieve metadata from web (thetvdb, themoviedb, and tagchimp)  Scriptable.  &gt; * Video preview that aides in creating chapter markers. &gt; * Tag files using mp4v2 library &gt; * Add to iTunes.  I'd probably go for python here. This is probably just a matter of using 3rd party libraries, no need to use Objective-C or anything like that.  Text processing (like processing metadata) is easier in python/perl than Objective-C. It seems most of the application will be dealing with that, so out of the two, python would be the way to go, imo.  As for portability, Objective-C does work under the major platforms, but you need to watch out for inconsistencies between the OpenStep implementations (GNUstep, Cocotron, Cocoa). Python is much more portable.  &gt; Compiles... better performance  Not really an issue. The performance-critical libraries are probably written as C extensions for python anyway.
Once I was at a party with a campfire.  The night was winding down, we were all pretty drunk/high.  Some people were leaving, others had gone inside to pass out on one of the many vacant beds in the guy's house (His rents were away and he was cool with it, was a friends-only type deal).  Well, one fellow had gone and drunk himself asleep on a log next to the fire.  Luckily for us, there was a pretty major road about a football field away, and we just happened to have six pretty big guys sober enough to carry the log to the median of it, with the guy on it.  Mind you, this was two AM and there was only a car every two or so minutes.  There was a hill between the road and the fire (which blocked the direct view), and we sat up there for a good hour waiting for him to wake up from the cars whizzing past him- they were kind of loud.  One guy had the smart idea to start shooting some bottle rockets at him, and that turned into roman candles, then to entire firework displays. We had probably shot 50 rockets in his general direction before one got a direct hit and lodged into the hood of his jacket.  He stood up like only a drunk fellow could, flailing wildly as the rocket kept screaming next to his head, stumbling in and out of lanes. It was only after he got it out did he realize that he wasn't next to the fire.  We were trying to hide on the hill, and he wouldn't have noticed us if we weren't laughing our asses off, but he started doing that clumsy jog towards us, almost getting hit by a truck as he tried to get over the metal railing (That he really could have just gone around).  When he finally got up to us, a police car with sirens blaring came barreling over a hill a half mile away (but visible), but this drunk fuck wouldn't shut the fuck up so we could stay hidden (We were smoking large amounts of weed, and some of the people drinking were under 21 so we didn't really need a cop up in our shit) and when the car was about two or three football fields away he still was talking loudly (Wasn't mad, for some reason) and didn't realize the weight of the situation, so we picked his ass up, one guy put a hand over his mouth and we ran to the house like it was the last chopper out of nam and this guy had just caught a shot to the gut.  Then we watched out the window like paranoid stoners as the number of flashing lights on that road just got bigger and bigger- they gave up about forty five minutes later, but overall it was pretty intense.
would that mean there would be no more stocks?
Welcome to reddit!  I've lurked for about a year, but registered 3 months ago.  I live in Muncie.
I don't buy used bongs.
Twice, actually (the first time he just forgot to deploy his landing gear).  He didn't have the endorsement to fly that plane, so he was flying illegally.  They closed the Scotts Valley airport permanently because of him.  His mom also wrote a letter to the Beech aircraft company, asking them not to sell her son any more planes.
Under your arm, like I said.  You know shoulder holsters come in different sizes and have these buckles for adjusting where they go.  The gun is to scare people, he's never had to fire it 'on the job' before.  And yes, I've seen it up close, I was working on my computer and he came over and when he leaned down to see what I was working on I saw the gun and asked him about it.  He took it out and showed it to me.  We got to talking about guns and whatnot.  He's a member of his local gun club in his hometown and a damn good shot.  Again, the gun is for show, mostly, if he was jumped by real robbers and he didn't have the drop on them and there were more of them than him and they were armed he knows better than to pull his gun on them, because then he ends up dead for insured jewelry, and even lots of expensive jewelry isn't worth someone's life.
Why no tax? Do you know if what you do would be legal in Canada/US?
ok, how is it that only a rich man can run for office?  cmon, couldn't you have preempted this question?
A lot of the crazies against him were against Bush too. Look at Alex Jones and his legion of followers. Anyway Bush got *plenty* of shit. People mocked him, made fun of his speak impediment, made death threats, protested with equally hateful signs, etc. This is just Obamas turn, except he has the media fueling the rage this time instead of calling them out for the nut-jobs they are like they did with Bush.  Bush came off as an incompetent idiot, so that's what people focused on. Obama is black with a Muslim sounding name, so that's what people are going to focus on now.   Edit: Wasn't it actually one guy who brought a pistol to a protest? The black guy with the AK was proven to be a set up wasn't it? 
You assuming that you're the only one here who does this (and assuming that you know how other people will respond after such activity) is a pretty good indication of the root problem here.
Don't forget Cave Story is coming out soon. Check out videos of Bit Trip Beat if you're into that sort of thing. Also, anything NES if you're interested in Virtual Console.
In all seriousness, please outline the rules of humor online. Maybe it would have been more appropriate for me to post a video of 2 girls eating shit out of a cup.
Reddit, should we find this guy and call someone professional?  Dude. There's always a reason to live. I'm not a professional, but you should see one.
mmm especially when it's warm from the oven with butter and honey. ;)
Many.  I live in the United States.  10 is the number so far I guess.  I own a semi-auto AK-47, a Ruger Mini-14 series 182, a Remington 700 in .243 Winchester(for deer and similar sized game), a Ruger 10/22, a Remington 870 HD in 12 gauge,  a Remington 870 Express 20 gauge (for bird hunting and trap/skeet), a Stevens side by side 12 gauge,  a Glock 23, a Kel-Tec P11 (this is my carry gun, yes I have a permit), and a Ruger MKII.  I'm looking for a good AR-15 if anyone has any recommendations.  I have only ever shot a DPMS AR and it was tack driving accurate; but I am looking towards a Lewis Machine and Tool Piston 16, because I have qualms about a design that shits where it eats.  The piston-driven systems seem to make more sense to me.
I was like you as well, once.  Then I discovered that I can use the notes as a funnel to pour the change into the pocket in my wallet, making the placement of notes easier.  The alternative is to awkwardly stow the bills while trying to not drop any change.  If you're feeling especially bold, you can funnel the change and then leave the till, inserting the bills later at your own convenience.  Such a piecemeal approach is more difficult with the change-first method.
Many (most) countries won't allow you to immigrate with HIV.  That being said, I emigrated to another country specifically for the health care.  I was lucky my issue wasn't HIV or I would have been on the plane somewhere else 24 hours after talking to my first doctor.   It was a mandatory test (along with TB)
Japanese women don't have big tits. This is a problem for feeding the wunderkinder.
Oh okay, I get it, you didn't say it directly, but why else would you be filled with rage? It can't have anything to do with our fucked up healthcare system, so that is irrelevant and I am going to assume you just wanted to slip that in to a post that should have been entitled "I have 11 days of HIV meds left and I am enraged at my poor life decisions, this is my own fault, healthcare has nothing to do with this (please someone bail me out, I admit what I did was my own fault and totally fucking stupid!)".   Cry me a river and wear a condom next time. 
I do currently actually. It's not as bad as everyone wants to pretend it is. I had no idea about the whole super conservative side of it until I moved away for a while. The whole west side and downtown is fairly liberal. And its by far the most beautiful of any of the Front Range communities. If you want scary go to Pueblo. But in all honesty I can't wait to move somewhere else, hopefully up to the mountains.

Ahhh.  On that note, I wholeheartedly agree with your mis-attribution! :)
I used to read those books alot when I was younger. I used to check the library like every year to see if more books came out. The particular stories that stand out was one about the neighborhood scamster and manhole cover that was square. Also, about Encyclopedia's dad trying to figure out how two criminals in the same hotel were communicating somehow thru the bathroom. Apparently, there was a TV show I missed out on because I was poor and didnt have cable back then.
This part isn't correct:   printf("Address of total is: %p\n", &amp;pointthree);  You are printing pointthree's address, not total's.  * total is an int * pointthree is a pointer to total * &amp;pointthree is pointthree's address  And I'm pretty sure this isn't the intended behaviour too (same as above):   printf("Address of Point One is: %p\n", &amp;pointone);  printf("Address of Point Two is: %p\n", &amp;pointtwo);
I would like one; maybe you'd have better luck finding those who have them by crossposting your request to some other subreddits?
The kid started it by calling him a fucking dick.  The cop seemed like he was being an okay guy about the situation until he was insulted.  And not only was the kid being a jerk, but he's a fucking retard as well.  You don't provoke people who have the ability to make your life better or worse in a very immediate and real way.  This is true of everyone you deal with, not just cops, but with your spouse, your coworkers, bosses, your children.  You just don't go around starting shit by being a little asshat.  Sorry but the po-po win this one.

Their return policy for when your kindle breaks is pretty good. They send you a UPS box and a new Kindle at the same time, so you just print out a label and mail your defective one back, but the whole time you have a new one.

&gt;I think that anyone who honestly answers a question with an obviously incorrect answer does not deserve to be listened to.  Expert trolling there, sir.  ABC/NBC/CBS/et al at least have standards they try to hold themselves.  To 1) claim they're all created equal, or 2) they aren't capable of good journalism *at all*...well, even attempting to reason with that logic is going to be futile.  Reddit, on the other hand.  The news submissions are made by non-journalists hold themselves to no standard other than maybe getting karma, trying to get people fired up, or perhaps trying to share something they found interesting.  The editorializing in headlines?  Misleading or flat out false stories?  Of course, reddit isn't a news site - you're reading submissions from other sources (unless you're getting news from self posts, which can hardly be considered credible sources of news), so you didn't really answer the question.  Where do you get your news from?
If Maloney's overdraft bill goes through it would be every bank. Lets all hope and pray.   In the meantime, take your bank to court for these type of overdrafts. Also, take them to court for the "highest to lowest" type overdrafts. I have not seen a case lost for either of these scenarios. The banks wouldn't dare take the chance of a precedent being set and will settle out of court.

sorry, man, there's no way the skin is that smooth and it retains that same tint throughout the whole body.  those photos are altered. even if they were natural, part of the big problem with this thread is the selection process.  if we had a company and set criteria for picking women for our website, we could just go out and find people that fit the criteria and put them together like they were some sexy happy family.  but the things is they wouldn't be, and the magazine would be a silly joke based on a calculated and commodifying marketing process.

&gt;Regardless, you're telling someone how to speak.  No, I was *asking* someone to use different terminology so as not to offend. 117 upvotes indicate that I am in the majority here.  Is it really that important for you to protect some kind of naive sense of free speech in relation to an issue that adds nothing to this discussion? In a discussion about mental illness would you chirp up about your right to refer to people as 'retards'?   Imagine you had your way, does that mean I have to suffer offense just to participate in this argument? Do you *really* care that much about whether or not you can refer to biological parents as "true parents" or not?  Think about it, your argument is very petty.

Trust me, your doctor will not look down on you, family doctors see this type of stuff all the time. If he does give you that feeling, you should find a new doctor who you are comfortable with. Get a referal for a psychiatrist if you haven't already. Therapy can help more than you think. If you suffer from depression, anti-depressants can help a great deal. They are very very common, so you would not be alone.   If you are serious, talk to a psychiatrist, it will help.

Why do you think it's valid to use violence to protect private property, but not valid to use violence to protect public property?

It's usually triggered by an event that is beyond my control and puts me in a tough spot, or at times coping with meaninglessness. What I usually do is distract myself with things I love, things that make me happy. This usually helps because it interrupts the flow of depressing thoughts, once I have a balanced mood I try to cope with the situation or thoughts by evaluating what I could do to change them. But I think it really depends on knowing yourself and forcing yourself out of these thoughts.
There's not much you can do other than get a tripod. You have a really light camera, so you can get away with a cheap tripod. You should be able to find one for under 30 bucks.

They open a whole new set of possible photographic opportunities.

Like most things in programming land, dependency injection can be explained, but you'll never 'get it' until after you've been  using it a while, and then are forced into using a framwork **without it**.  If you're a Java dev  (or know it well), go ahead and get the Spring in Action book from Manning. The first third or so goes into the whys and hows of DI, and the rest is about the framework API's that use what you've previously learned. Spring is not perfect, but it is pretty damn helpful and makes Java a whole lot easier to deal with!

My father has been dealing gout for a while in his legs. Just take the meds and eat a very balanced group of foods.

He's also on loads of blood thinners and other shit too from Open Heart surgeries and loads of other stuff, so his experiences might be a bit different. We have bacon maybe once a month.
I think it's still legitimately confusing to tell people to not use a tool that you say isn't bad.  It's the same sort of wtf as God putting the forbidden apple in the garden of eden.

Well the problem with that is that what you consider reasonable is not going to be what the guy next door to you consider's reasonable, everyone has their own opinion and there has to be a set standard for ROF.  As well what you consider reasonable will change depending on the circumstances, it does for all of us, when I see some videos of police actions I am disgusted and think that they were wrong but then when I consider it again, ex: 2 officers trying to arrest a person who has commited a non-violent crime would act differently then the same situation but with a group of over 20 people around them with an unknown intent or armement who appear to be siding with the suspect.   the rule of safety is: any suspect taken into custody must be protected at all costs, then the officers safety, then the publics, then property.  I will use any and all legal means that I can justify to protect myself, my partner, and anyone or anything I believe must be protected.  Hope that helps some!
One of my favorites is "Only Forward" by M.M.Smith.  He already has the "superpower" at the start of the novel, but you learn about it around the middle of the novel, so I don't know if that counts.  It's a wonderful novel either way, tho. One of my favorites.
I used to sleep walk a lot when I was younger, but not too much anymore.  I would go all over the place though.  Sometimes the hypnagogic dreams are like sleep walking.  Sometimes I know where I am but other times I think i'm in different spot and try to go around as if the same features will be there (like the radiator and door incident). So that variant is basically a coherent sleep walking but for me it's just a complete visual hallucination. The strange thing is, now that I think about it, that I never hear things or talk to people when it's like that.  Often i'll think that I woke up in a completely different place and there will be people sleeping around me. I guess it's like the dream about being naked in front of a bunch of people, instead I wake up half clothed around sleeping people and try to make my way out without them waking up and wondering why I don't have all my clothes on. For example, I thought I woke up on the balcony of this theatre we used for school events. There were people all over it and I had to make my way around all of them to the door.  I got there and I eventually realized I was hallucinating because the balcony had a sliding door. Sliding the normal door didn't work.  When I pulled the handle I realized where I was and things just kind of materialized back into reality.  Also, I was at a friend's house.  The most intense hallucinations always happened when I wasn't at my house.

I've extensively used both, and prefer glossy over matte.  With a matte screen it's impossible to remove glare from bright lights.  No matter how you adjust the screen you get a diffuse glow.  With a glossy screen I can adjust the angle a little bit and the glare is gone.  Glossy screens also work better in direct sunlight when you turn the backlight off.  Maybe you all just hate laptops with shitty hinges?

That is the way I visualized it except, C sort of encourages you to think "int * c" means that you have a variable c such that *c is an int. The only place it seems this way is if you declare a bunch of variables in one line. I had a student get completely confused until he wrote it as "&amp;int x" in his notes, solved the problem and then fixed the declaration (He got a if that helps you think it through but don't actually use that disapproval)

I live in Utah, and I *was* raised Mormon up until I was about 10 years old. At this point in time, my parents allowed me and my siblings to choose our religious beliefs. I chose no religion.  I have struggled with it more than most people know. However, you are an adult and you can do whatever you want. Just stop going to church, it's really as simple as that. Have them erase you from their records if you want to go that far. I still need to do that. There's no Mormon Mafia that will suffocate you with jello in your sleep if you don't believe. ;)

The Arrau performance is even more impressive considering he is around 80 years old there (I think that actually might have been his 80th birthday concert, though I'm not completely sure). It gets very difficult to play that well past even 60 or 70, as coordination and concentration often slowly deteriorate, and arthritis can make it painful to play. He seemed fine, though. Amazing.

Look through your statements and see if you signed up for "overdraft protection" or something like that. Basically its a "service" the bank provides you to allow you to never have your card declined, but allows them to collect overdraft fees whenever you go into a negative balance. I hears something about Bank of America and Chase allowing their customers to opt out of this protection, but I would recommend you go to the actual banks and ask instead of just taking my word for it.

The idea of having teeth knocked out or broken freaks me the fuck out. I think I'd rather lose a limb. (No, going to the dentist doesn't much bother me.)  I don't like being within arm's reach of a person holding a knife, even if it's my partner and we're cooking together. Not that I think that they're going to stab me -- more that I think that I might clumsily bump them and they'd cut their fingers off or something.  This isn't exactly a phobia, more of a squick: I'm rather unsettled by the idea of people recreationally destroying things that someone built or made -- like artworks, or cars, computers or other machinery. If the thing is broken and useless already, it doesn't bother me -- but smashing a working computer strikes me as kinda gross, pretty much on the same level of squick as (say) hitting a small animal with a car.

You are correct that guns may escalate a conflict that would not otherwise turn deadly.  Most gun owners are normal people with as strong an aversion to murder as your own, though, so the great majority of confrontations in which citizens pull guns on violent criminals end without anybody getting shot.  (This has been documented.)  My own personal reason: I grew up in a moderately violent place, and learned early on that while most people can be reasoned with via diplomacy, some can be reasoned with only by violence, or the credible threat of violence. A gun is simply a tool for dealing with those rare pieces of shit. I also like to be self-reliant in plumbing, so I own the tools necessary to unclog my own drains and fix my own toilet.  The alternative is to call a plumber.  Self-defense is just another dirty job that one can either acquire one's own tools and skills for, or call somebody else to come over with the tools for the job.  I prefer to be able to do it myself. Most people who say they are "against guns" will still be willing to call the police if they feel threatened.  So they're willing to have gun violence done on their behalf, but imagine that they acquire some virtue by not pulling the trigger themselves.  It's simple hypocrisy.

I played intense Risk successfully all through college and afterwards.  With with 'intense' meaning everyone had to put a $5 bill under the board, to be forfeited if they got enraged and tipped over the board. (With inflation that would probably be the equivalent of committing $25 today.) And we played for money.  Anyhow, I never lost a single Risk game, ever, until years later when I had kids, and they got old enough to play, and they all ganged up on me from the first turn.  This was after I was mean and trounced all them a few times. But that's another story.  In those days we played strictly according to the green rules pamphlet enclosed in the original Risk game - the game box which has the little enameled square shiny wooden blocks as its armies. So listen up.  I read all the comments here and I am chipping in because I was quite surprised that no one mentioned my two key winning strategies.  (After the obvious ones like "Try to take South America or Australia early." and "Keep the cards coming." and "Don't roll 2 against 2." etc.  Those are all good, yes.  The two keys to consistent winning are: (1) Take big RISKS! That's why they named the game! Meaning you should make big nasty sweeping attacks, spreading out all over.  I would attempt to destabilize the board repeatedly by wide-based attacks over many countries and players as soon as I had the resources to do so.  And you should do this as often as you can, after you have secured some continent to reliably generate bonus armies. It really keeps your opponents off balance, where they tend to make mistakes in recovery.  (People usually prefer to hunker down behind piles of armies somewhere, and having to improvise puts them at a disadvantage.) Part of the key for knowing when you can do this widespread attacking is estimating how many of those countries will still be in your hands after the angry counter-attacks occur during your opponents' next turns.  You always want to have some of the new countries remain yours after the counter-attacks. An excellent time to launch is when you KNOW you will have a card set on your next turn. This strategy really disrupts everyone else, and it has always paid off for me.  Plus it has side benefits.  For instance your residual new country count will generate more armies.  And it reduces your opponent's  bonus armies on their upcoming angry turn. Plus it completely ruins everyone else's best-laid plans. It's kind of like ASSUMING that you will attempt to shoot the moon with every single hand of Hearts! (another college skill). People always think that big "stacks" of armies is safe and good, but a wide panoply of single-army countries can be very effective, often simply because most opponents do not have the skill nor sufficient armies to take all your countries back once you have stunned them. (Of course you still have your own safe "home base" continent with its piled armies -- don't attempt this breakout attacking until you build one!)  (2) My other big, huge tip is to BREAK ALLIANCES. Breaking the key alliance at the correct calculated time NEVER FAILS.  And don't worry, you will be amazed how people will still make alliances with you next game even after you have screwed them previously. It's all part of the undocumented game - like trading property deeds in Monopoly. Important alliances should be made with your plan to break them already in the equation.  So, combined with all the other excellent discussion which I see occurring here, I would add (a) to RISK repeated big sweeping attacks and  (b) to plan all along to BREAK that key alliance when the time is right for you.  I still have my 1960's wooden armies version and vastly prefer it to the plastic-y stuff.  Regards from the old school!

&gt; Having HIV/AIDS doesn't mean you made a poor personal choice.  Not all the time, but it is highly correlated with having made systemic poor choices, at least here in the United States - either promiscuous homosexual anal sex or unsanitary injection drug use.  Do you deny this, or that either of those things represent a poor personal choice?  If so, I'd be curious to know what constitutes a poor personal choice in your book.
Of course. But does it really matter if each country produces all its own necessities and only trades for luxuries? That is, what's the advantage to importing food, and thereby becoming dependent upon that country to feed you? That hasn't worked out well with energy.  (Clearly there is an advantage to importing foods that will not grow in the home country. I'm talking about the staples of life, without which the people would starve.)
After rereading your definition, i'm not so sure that i used the term incorrectly. Are you suggesting that the broadly associated groups do not work together (with at least the help of the government) to reduce inefficiency and maximize the benefit to the individual bodies?   I see your point that corporatism is not necessarily related to business corporations. But in this case we have business corporations heading the individual bodies. And given the dictionary definition of fascism, is the association unwarranted? (Yes, it's unwarranted if you take the next step and associate to, say, the Holocaust.)

That sort of society has no use for questions, or debate.  So a society which is patriotic, loyal, and obedient is going to be quite friendly.  Like, say, North Korea.

And this is related to brainwashed Southern affluence because...?  How in the world do these things connect?  &gt;&gt;If you do, you might seem unpatriotic, flag-burning or Californian.  So Southern people are nice because they are worried that, if they aren't, they will seem _liberal_?  You're telling me with a straight face that you believe this?

Unlike Europe the US is a litigious society... and arresting Polanski thirty years after the fact proves that to the world nicely.  The point in this case is that the judicial system during Polanski's case seriously FUCKED UP, that's why he fled, that's why the victim doesn't want the law being involved anymore, and that's why the US should keep their nose in its own affairs, instead of witch hunting celebrity directors living in France.

I was raised in a pretty strict religious household but somehow never managed to notice or care.  I never thought about it, and it seemed my family let it drop as soon as they realized I wasn't interested.  So, I'm really lucky that they considered me "damned" early on.  I don't know anything about coping with the loss of a guiding metaphor per se, but I will admit I'm extremely curious about the nature of stories like yours.  Specifically, the sense of loss.  To me it would seem a sense of intellectual freedom!  As for death, why would you worry?  Nobody ever came back to tell us how lonely and pointless it might be.  On the other hand, you may try to reason some comfort from believing that if you're dead you won't really notice how pointless and empty everything is.  One thing I can guarantee is that you will "live" forever, precisely because you can't perceive "nothing".  The nature of this eternity is an interesting question, since it's somewhat reasonable to expect that it would be built on the self-awareness you had at the time you logged off.  My advice is to try not to be afraid of it, because if the above is accurate then fear equals an eternity of hell.  Regardless, I recommend you check out Douglas Hofstadter's book *I Am a Strange Loop*.  It's all about the process of asking unanswerable questions, and it's forthright and personable without plying an agenda.  EDIT: I wasn't sure about what form of reaction I might take to certain things you wrote.  However, if you are sincere:  When you mention the bits about the pointlessness of life if there is no Eternal Justice (or whatever), you're just being selfish.  The point is that those we love (which should be everybody) are given rewards for your selflessness to use as tools to pass on.  You don't need a God to tell you to work for a better future.  Contemplate the meaning of some of the better teachings of religion and see if there's a connection.
That way lies madness, sir.  There are a series of things which could trigger me completely dropping out of society altogether, and that is one.
Thanks for keeping me honest. I love the look Helmet and Colonel Sanders give each other after Skroob says what **Creepybusguy** quotes.
Playing the blame game doesn't always work, especially when you have multiple people who think they were right in an argument. The 'do better next time' could well make multiple people take stock and see their parts in an unproductive dispute, and keep it in mind next time.

Blood transfusion, contact with HIV positive blood (if you work in a hospital, as a paramedic whatever), being born with it (if your mother is HIV positive)...
I'm sorry, your link doesn't refute my arguement, so you are neither right, nor will I apologize. Being exposed (fetus or infant) to HIV before or during birth or through breast feeding   HIV also can be transmitted through blood infected with HIV. However, since 1985, all donated blood in the United States has been tested for HIV. Therefore, the risk for HIV infection through the transfusion of blood or blood products is extremely low. The U.S. blood supply is considered among the safest in the world. For more information view our question and answer on blood safety. Now I believe you owe me an apology.

My favorite book on the subject is "The Sixth Extinction" by Richard Leakey.  http://www.amazon.com/Sixth-Extinction-Patterns-Future-Humankind/dp/0385468091
The similar theme is more interestingly, and approachably discussed in GGM's novel "Love and Other Demons".   While Rushdie got in a big trouble for the book and all that - the novel is about much more different stuff than the verses. It's more a novel on mongrelization of immigrating races than anything else.

USA  Springfield XD40 - self/home defense weapon Walther P22 - cheap plinker for the range  For those that question why anyone would need a gun, I was pretty much ordered to buy one by my LEO (law enforcement office) wife after she attended a police family defense course and had to listen to the 911 call of a sheriff's wife being chased and murdered by a person the sheriff had previously arrested.  I had never had much interest in owning a firearm but had been to the range many times and enjoyed shooting.  Now that I do own, I find myself wanting to learn more about them and how to carry and use them as effectively as possible.

Are you calling me a dumbass?  Your sentence structure is confusing.
The thing is: I'm European. We're happy with our low levels of gun ownership/homicide.  You do things differently in the USA and I won't get involved because your situation is so different to ours.  I'm, happy in my country never fearing gun crime, but I'm not so arrogant as to assume this is the only way things can be done.
&gt;And where is that money to buy those guns come from? Either you pass that elevated cost to the consumer My point is that the cost of extra guns is minimal and would not lead to significantly increased prices. Especially if the cost of those guns is offset by the new territory and decreased competition that result from wiping out rivals. 
After several years of living with my mother in homeless shelters and with relatives, then being bounced around several foster and respite homes, I was adopted by a foster family at the age of 9. At the time, the laws were such that a child could be kept under permanent foster care, something less than adoption, but more than casual foster care. The family that adopted me had cared for a girl my age under these laws when they changed. Under the new law, a child can only be in a foster care for, I believe, six months before they either have to be adopted or go back to the biological family. This forced my foster parents, who were only willing to adopt one child - they'd adopted three others and had eight of their own - to decide between me and this girl my age. She made the decision for them by running away. The well-known rule of this foster family was that, if you ran away, you were not allowed back. And so, I became their son, and the other girl went on to have an incredibly unfortunate life.  All this time, I have retained contact with my birth mother. My birth father, abusive and estranged from the family since my parents' divorce before I was born, lives many states away, and though I speak to him on occasion, there are many other men in my life who have been more of a father than he ever was, and so I have not pursued a relationship with him. My father's family history is available, and something I need to obtain from him. My mother was involved in a closed adoption, and although she managed to uncover who her mother was, she will probably never know who her father was. Both of my families get along fine, and my mothers are and have been on excellent terms.

my postings are not here to make a case for pedophilia, they are simply to show why this case is controversial, why we're still discussing it, and why we should all look at the case beyond the superficial level of an-old-fuck-raped-a-young- innocent-girl.  I agree that the acts Polanski committed were wrong, he plead guilty, he even served time in jail. This isn't about him not being guilty, this is about how the California justice system (specifically the judge in the case) is flawed and corrupt. Why should the US spend more money and time on him? Why is it all of a sudden, 30 years later, the American law cares again?  To answer your question if it was my daughter? Well, one thing I did learn from the Polanski case example, I sure wouldn't seek for justice in the California justice system and cause my daughter even more trauma and disgrace. I would probably hire someone to blow his nuts off first.

I'd agree with you except the point about starting a task with one hand tied behind your back. While not a useful tool for all music making, giving certain strict limitations often causes some very cool output. Compose a verse without ever using a I chord... do a 12-tone exercise... hell look at what POTUSA did with a 2 string bass and 3 string guitar.  Is this a useful tool for most musicians? Probably not. Is this a useful tool for nobody? Maybe, or maybe it will inspire some oddball here or there. I like toys like that, even if they don't bode well for their manufacturer/designer.  That said, if you just want a cheap portable laptop midi controller, there are some really simple keyboard ones (some even roll up) with normal key layouts.  ps: I do agree with you that the tenori kicks mountains of ass.

Ozymandias disregarded morality, and in so doing lost the only thing keeping him in check. Causing him to murder millions on pretty flimsy ideas which are implied to backfire completely (both by his name, and the black freighter story).

That's correct.  Although if someone truly were not using the land at all, it would be easy to trespass on.  But ultimately the owner has the right to remove someone from his property.  It's based on the principle that you have to work to contribute toward society, in order to reap the benefits of society.  If you wish to go live in a forest, surviving on your own, you can do so if you wish.  Even if someone owns the land, it'd be near impossible to find you.

I have absolutely no experience and zero grounds (aside from mere intuition) for this advice, but it seems inherently effective:  After you come to peace with your decision to permanently leave the Church, never to return, I suggest the following steps be taken in chronological order, in the event that you find no support from your family:  1. GET OUT OF UTAH! Secure a job and housing in a different state. This step will require the most time and preparation.  2. Make your intent (and immediately act upon it) known to the Church. Complete any actions necessary to officially dissolve your membership with the Church as soon as possible.  3. Discuss, dispute, and resolve your decision with your family, without negotiating your decision. Make it known that you have no intention to dissolve your relationship with your family, just with the Church. Acknowledge that although the two may not be mutually exclusive in the eyes of your family, you hope that at some point in the future they will see things differently. Tell them eventually you hope that they prioritize family over faith.  4. After "resolving" things with your family, immediately relocate to your new home and begin a fresh chapter of your life.  I hope this baseless but instinctive advice finds some use. It'll by no means be a walk in the park. Cheers, and good luck.

Even with the UK covered with CCTV's they still have an astronomical crime rate compared to the USA. Even Canada seems to have a lot more assault victims, burglaries, robberies, rape victims, and slightly more property crime than we do.

CFL's have a limited application--dry, heated area, with adequate airflow and regulated power supply. They should not be used in ceiling fixtures(kitchens), outside fixtures, damp locations(bathrooms or basements) or on any power grid that doesn't maintain 110-120v consistently(Third World countries and fixtures in the US with dimmers)--otherwise they burn out and in some cases burn up.

It's worth noting that the notion of an APB messing with your measurements is outside of what I'd consider the theme of this conversation.  Fallible senses don't require trickster APBs to perceive reality incorrectly nor would a god require tricks of perception to hide from us even if it did have a physical manifestation.  &gt; Do you do this for other such things?  Of course.  I *don't believe* in fairies, unicorns or vampires or gods.  As far as positive beliefs, that isn't the topic in hand.  I have seen evidence of trees, cars, binary stars, and grape soda that I find plausible and I find it sensible to believe in them.  I may be incorrect in that belief, but at the very least there is some evidence to support the stance.  To turn the question around, do you spend time enumerating the things you believe do not exist?  Vampires with 10 toes?  Vampires with 9 toes? Vampires with 7 feet?  Vampires that breed with fairies to produce unicorn offspring?  Since there are infinite number of things you likely would believe do not exist I'd suspect not.  What makes a god hypothesis any different?  As an added disadvantage to that approach, you'd also have to consider whether there was sufficient evidence for any claim to infer non-existence.  It is not entirely implausible that unicorns may be a lost cousin of the rhinoceros that is now extinct, do you go examining the fossil record to look for related species?  Analyze junk DNA in the rhino looking for deactivated skinny horselike DNA? Even if you didn't find anything it wouldn't affirmatively disprove the hypothesis, because the fossil record is incomplete and a rhino-unicorn could be from a parallel genetic branch that had all members die out.  For the example of a fairy detecting device.  If I believed that fairies were invisible, immaterial and undetectable then I would by necessity believe in fairies and not be lacking belief (and of course this is very similar to a theist stance).  I'm having a bit of trouble parsing the rest of the thought experiment, because I'm having trouble imagining how I could both not believe in fairies and yet believe that there was a device that could detect their existence.  It would seem to me that if we knew enough about fairies to be able to determine their presence then we would by necessity know enough about them to prove their existence.  Let me posit a different case to highlight just one hypothetical case where I believe it would be possible for a godlike being to remain undetected and undetectable:  Suppose you have an entity that creates the perceived universe and this entity has the operational parameters that allow it to determine every event down to the subatomic level from big bang to gnab gib.  This entity sets the universe in motion like a gigantic Rube Goldberg machine and retreats to a side dimension to watch the dominoes fall, possibly peeking in through singularities dipping between dimensions to film this for the godly equivalent of YouTube.  A weak atheist in this universe would be correct to assume that the evidence did not support belief in a god.  A strong atheist, however, would be incorrect to assert that there is no god.

To all of those "concerned" about this, remember John Kerry in 2004?  The little thing called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth?  He ignored it and look what happened.  John McCain did the same thing in 2000, when the rumor in South Carolina was he had a black child.  Look where it got him. It's about damn time someone at the White House started calling a lie a lie.  They need to call these people out right at the start, confront them at every turn.  This is not to turn the hearts of the Beck fans.  This is to make sure that the rest of the electorate knows what's going on before the lie takes hold.

Did I say anything about jail or castration? I was referring to his general attitude in saying that he is a douchebag.  People who are into CP arguably need help.

Occasionally they are violent, but more often than not I'm trying to hook up with some random chick in the dream.(Sometimes I've even succeed)  Often the buildings that people are in will have a whole wall missing so you can just walk right in.  They usually seem like run down places with no electricity.  Near waterways or dilapidated industrial areas. Sometimes there will be weird secret tunnels in these places that you have to crawl through.  Sometimes the dream will happen in the same place but be different as far as whats happening.  I've had a couple in that weird casino building with all the trashed out upper floors. (Like 40-50 stories)  I get a good one like these that I remember about once every two months. 
I have done this.  Morning.  Go to work earrrrrly.  Have a nice workout with co-workers who are into the same form of physical fitness I'm into.  Head to in-building shower.  Clean up.  Feels nice because I'm sweaty.  Exit shower... reach for towel... FFFFFUUUUUUU!  Left it at home!  Emergency procedure:  dry off with heaps of paper towels.  Result:  unsatisfactory.
Some of us weren't ever __not__ atheist. 
agreed, I will probably be killed for this but I have found Digg at least mildly entertaining lately, not so much for Reddit.
I, for one, welcome our immortal lobster overlords.
No, they're right.  When it's said US law doesn't recognize dual citizenship, what is meant is that US law doesn't deal in any way with it.  You're either a US citizen or you aren't, and any other citizenships are irrelevant.  So, in short, it's cool.
I still don't see the relevance of your objection.
GSK has really been awesome. They help when they can. Right now they do not have any programs that can help me. 
Nothing in your comment negates my point.
The same cues that tell you when to cross the street after seeing a white dude
I think they should, she's just talking like there is no question, she's keeping it, so I asked.  Personally I dont think you should make the decision to have someones kid without their "permission". There is a funny permission/emission joke here, but I cant quite word it...
Ah, I've had that. Makes me miss my Bosnian friends.
Although I see where you are coming from, I am a counselor and feel the need to speak up for my profession. First of all, I am sorry that you were attacked for something you did in junior high. I would NOT have encouraged that person to give those letters out to the people who angered him (years ago?). Writing can be a powerful and therapeutic tool, but it sounds like it went too far in this case. If the counselor had the person send the letters, he/she made an assumption that there was only one side to the story (your friend's) and he/she was setting your friend up with potential relationship problems with the people who received a letter (like you). As they say at my therapeutic day school, "giving other people bad feelings is not going to give you good feelings in the end" Counseling in general can be a painful experience. You might realize things about yourself or your relationships with other people that are hard to sit with. But working through those things is what will bring you to a more complete sense of self, allowing you to navigate your world in the best ways that you can. Sometimes it takes years of therapy to come to terms with something you find within yourself. I have a more relational/interpersonal approach with my clients, so I tend to believe that my client's "problems" affect his/her relationships with others. Learning about yourself, increasing your self-awareness, and addressing strengths and weaknesses is ALWAYS going to benefit people you love and strengthen relationships. I hope this makes you feel a little more optimistic about counseling!!
It all depends on your perspective. I personally agree with the OP that the country that benefits mankind the most would be the best.
So Norwegians that create RPG games have so speak option? What a silent game that must be.
What other things that adults choose to do would you ban?   Would you ban driving, which contributes to 42,000 deaths per year?  That would even out the people without insurance right there.  And, there are untold numbers that die from the pollution caused by autos.  Why stop at cigarettes?
I have demonoid invites.  Willing to trade.  (As soon as they come back, of course.)
Well, in that case: it's never too late to repent :)  (I love being playing the devil's advocate)
Yes and No. And yes.
sucks man
It was pretty clear in saying that cats fed corporate, packaged food would be unlikely to have it, while cats who ate wild rats were more likely to have it.  Thus human cultures where there are more wild-fed cats are more likely to have the parasite.
What's wrong with a Yaris? It gets good MPG, it's cheap, and that will leave money for other things.
Erm...  yes it is.  The fact that the Ciénaga Massacre loosely inspired a similar event in *One Hundred Years of Solitude* doesn't make the **fictional town** of Macondo any more real.  Or do you think Oceania is real too?
It's just like wine is bad because people should be writing cross platform open source software, but it is also good because it means I can play Starcraft on my laptop. It is the battle between idealism and pragmatism and I think RMS strikes a nice balance.
Btw, if you haven't done it already then you are still in their records. You can write a letter to the church offices to have them remove you, and this helps stop the random visits.  When I moved to Phoenix I first had the local Bishop come by. Between then and the next thing, I had my records removed. Some time later, the first and second counselors to the Bishop, or whatever they're called (Wow, I'm forgetting things!), came by and I informed them that I had sent the letter and received the response confirming my removal. I haven't been bothered since.
Hold on now guys. That prosecutor drives a 100,000 dollar car and can never be a judge if his case record isn't great. Cut him some slack. 
The real tragedy here is that if Fox News viewers see this post on the White House website they are going to chalk it up as "socialist propaganda". Typically they are in the no fact check zone
Then record every officer for sound and video *at all times without exception* while they are on duty, then make these records available to the public.  Let the court of public opinion decide whether each officer acted reasonably in each disputed situation, and if it is decided that the officer did not act reasonably then let the public democratically decide what his/her punishment should be.  As it is the police are policing themselves, and that is obviously not working very well.  The police are effectively able to act with no restraint whatsoever, with no consequences.  Honestly, I am way, way more scared of the police than I am of any other gang or 'criminal'.
Color me jealous, I have to use VB.NET at work and would love to be programming in Python instead.
I just found out we're pregnant with our first child a few weeks ago. Wife had me meet her at a sushi restaurant prior to a dog-training class we were going to.   She gave me a wrapped present, which was a onesie. Elliott Smith was playing and I'll never forget that moment..
my family and i were vacationing in canada. my siblings and i were bar hopping. we went to our first bar and got the bill. we only had US dollars so after checking the conversion rate we left money for the bill and the tip.  Much later in the night we realized the canadian dollar was stronger than the US dollar. we then realized the money we left at the first bar was woefully inadequate. we felt like assholes.   On our way back to the hotel we stopped at the original bar, drunkenly tried to explain ourselves to the waitress who served us, drunkenly ordered one last shot, and drunkenly left a massive tip.
The original MBPs had a lot of glare problems in my experience.  There were a few times I've had to go inside to read something or watch a video because the reflections were brighter than the display.

Yeah I've bought the babushkas wrapped packs as well. The shop I got them from was charging about a buck a round though.  I just need to suck it up and buy the 440rd packs from the online guys.
Halo is mediocre... there's nothing in it that hasn't been done before.   That being said, I'm very good at it, and love the competitive online game play. It's easily my favorite game, but not because I think it's the best game ever created (it isn't by a long shot) but because I'm good at it, and I personally find it enjoyable. It's not for everyone, you're not alone.
I fucked up again haha. Not afraid to admit it. Yeah, I actually think people do approve of the show. Isn't entrapment illegal? The show does nothing illegal or how else is the police involved? Also, people don't see it as entrapment. A lot of people don't really know the exact definition of entrapment. People are stupid. People see the show as ridding the world of evil.
I loved it. I actually still have an Encyclopedia Brown VHS.
&gt;I think that anyone who honestly answers a question with an ***obviously incorrect answer*** does not deserve to be listened to.  You assume there is a right or wrong answer to a question that asks for personal preference (opinion)? Are you sure you don't already watch Fox?

Consistent?  Pssh.  He talks about how much he loves "personal liberty," but ask him about abortion and watch his consistency disappear.  Also, how bad is it where we have someone who valiantly stands by his ideas that are just bad ideas (leaving everything to completely free market is about the most naive thing you can do) but they're so happy he is "consistent" and doesn't pander that they completely ignore that.  
In the bottom of a closet. But, I don't really store too much at once. Maybe five rolls each of black and white, color slide and color negative, and then maybe five to ten various Polaroid and instant films.
Let it die.  Like that girl from 1990.
I'm not sure you're 100% on that "quite literally", there, Lou.  Or will this be over several cliffs? You could ring the Grand Canyon with the United States' population and run them all over the edge, but the transport costs would be gigantic.
There was one where he figured out a woman was actually a man in a wig because - get this - he sat with his back to the restaurant when any woman would sit facing the restaurant.  That has got to be the flimsiest of evidence in the entire series.
Check out Cytomegalovirus, SV40, Rous Sarcoma Virus, the other Avian Leukosis Viruses, all were initially spread through vaccines. It appears that Epstein Barr virus may be linked to the Rubella vaccine, but that requires more research,
Doesn't evolution have to do with how an organism can change over time? I don't think it had anything to do with creation of organisms.   I do believe evolution happens. I also believe that we were created.

She's clearly wearing panties if you look at her mons/where the pubs would be.  They are nude in color, but definitely panties.  In the photo it looks like one of her labia is popping out of her underwear or something.  Completely understandable when you consider all the twisting and contorting and jumping she was doing.  She should have worn boyshorts or better panties.  Fuck it, a whole 'nother outfit would have been better.  Her's looked stupid.  Edit:  Prudes really have nothing to argue about regarding this show.  It's been on the air for a while and shows all sorts of provocative dancing and girls dressed like hos.  A 2 second clip of some random potential labia is not nearly as "sinful" as all the gyrating they do.
it cannot be measured anyway

Don't get mad at people writing checks. Nobody actually likes to write a check. They're either doing it because they're old and would take infinitely longer if they were expected to swipe their own debit card, or their debit card is lost/broken.

Make sure he thinks through his MOS and chooses wisely.  Your bro may feel the need for a male authority figure, and he'll find plenty of them in the Navy.  Just make sure he understands that it consists of assloads of boring shit and being told what to do, and that unlike any civilian job, they can put you in jail if you tell your boss to go fuck himself and/or try to quit.
To run for the major roles this would be true, but most politicians start off at a very small local position and work their way up.  And anyways, anyone can run, and if people educated themselves they could choose the best candidate instead of the ones with the most commercials and signs.
I was impressed and influenced also, but ... non-fiction? 'Lotta that on this thread.

I stayed in Oslo, Norway for about 4 months, from Feb-May on Business about 2 years ago. I'm from Florida and I'm 28. My company put me up in a little, dorm-style apartment and gave me spending money. I loved my experience in Norway, but I'll mention some of the stuff that sucked first:  -Couldn't buy beer on Sunday (at all) in any store -Couldn't buy beer past 8:30 pm in any store. On any day. Except for Sunday, which was all day long -There is a 'sin' tax in Norway on cigarettes and alcohol making them ridiculously expensive, cigarettes are about $10-12 dollars a pack and beer was taxed as heavily -I don't smoke but my friends complained about the price  -Religious holidays, mostly Protestant (Evangelical-Lutheran) holidays, would cause the entire city to shut down for a week where you couldn't buy food because the grocery stores were closed, forget about buying beer, I was more worried about finding dinner on these days  -You could get a beer at a pub, on any day, any time for about $10-$15 American dollars -if you were willing to spend the money  Now for the good stuff: -Public transportation was amazing. Clean and fast. The rail through town and the buses got me everywhere -or I walked (yay exercise) -One of my American co-workers got sick and was able to see a doctor that same day, was treated and back at work in a few hours -Norwegian's have great bread and fresh shops, I walked a lot and ate a lot of bread, it all worked out in the end  -Great art and outside events, I loved Vigeland Sculpture Park
That's your understanding of the word, not necessarily the definition. The way the word is thrown around here (and by "here", I mean the media in the UK), fundamentalists, or rather fundamentalist muslims, hold strong connotations to muslim extremism. Whereas you're using the word purely to convey that you believed in the five pillars, right? The title mislead me in that regard.
No, you're thinkins of Alchemists. Anarchists are those people who warn everyone about some major tragic global event.
Seriously, America tries to spread democracy around the world, but how is the system they have where lobbyists get their way any better than say Zimbabwe or something?

Yes have him come home, make dinner. Stay upbeat/positive and just tell him. It might take a while to sink in, and a range of emotions might show.

I was in a 2 year serious relationship with an amazing yet deeply mistrustful woman who managed to convince me that all I needed was her, so most of my friendships suffered. We broke up last November and the same month I got laid off. Let's just say 2009 has not been a banner year in my life... I have been trying to rebuild friendships and career ever since (not to mention find a saner woman) so believe me when I say I've had some pretty rough times myself lately. I'm still struggling as a solo IT consultant and I can't seem to find a full-time job to this day. I deal with self-doubt constantly, but I'm slowly getting back on the ball.  It sounds like you were proactive about leaving your husband. I think that's good- you know what you want and you're willing to make sacrifices to get there. You should feel good about yourself for at least that part. Now the dating of the new guys... If he's all that you've got going on, of course it will seem like he's blowing you off because he took the time to maintain his friendships and side interests and wants to do those sometimes. You should try to do the same... You have to cultivate yourself like a plant, just gotta get out there in some way shape or form where you're interacting with people. Also don't forget regular exercise and regular sleep which I've found boosts my mood a heck of a lot...
Starcraft
I don't have any in my house, but not because I don't want any.  Mostly because they cost money, and I'd rather spend money on other things right now like tech gadgets and golf.  Also, I am afraid I would wake up in a haze and shoot my wife when she startles me in the middle of the night.  My dad has a bunch that I can shoot whenever I want.  A couple of AK-47's, rifles and shotguns.  He lives out in the country so there's no danger of accidentally shooting something I shouldn't...
I was there too! first time in a daily show audience.

Ever more desperate for power, Republican John Perry of Con website Newsmax wrote that President Obama "is inviting" a military coup and that it might not be such a bad thing.  They tried this before but General Smedley Butler exposed the Business Plot to overthrow FDR.  Republicans hate a government of We The People.
I guess I'd ask if there are fewer murders and rapes due to the legal 'ban' on them?   I'll not comment on drugs.

Religion is the virus and hate is the disease, but it's actually more important to consider the security hole that permits the virus to spread, because religion isn't the only thing to abuse it (and some of the others also spread hate). That hole is the human tendency to believe the "tribal elders" of the ingroup over more qualified voices in the outgroup.  The patch is to mentally sort experts by topical qualification *before* considering whose view sounds plausible.
You know what? FUCK YOU! I live in a country with universal health care and you know what? It takes almost NOTHING to ensure that everyone in my country has access to medical help. I can afford it now so I help others and when I can't afford it others help me.  Because I can afford it I pay $300 a year from my taxes. THAT is pittance compared to what Americans have to pay when they have fucking insurance. I can walk into any doctors and pay NOTHING for my treatment. Drugs cost alot cheaper than America. I also have health insurance and I KNOW my insurance company cannot bail out on me when I need it most and also it costs almost nothing to have insurance. I know that if I go to hospital it costs me practically nothing for treatment.  The Government doesn't 'take care of everything' for us, WE the people take care of ourselves through this system because we know one day we may need it.
And it's actually one of the few things our federal government spends money on that's constitutionally allowed: To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;  But when your economy is already dead, it's really not a good time to be spending like it's flourishing.

If that's the intent I suppose. I'd rather maintain that while it's not really an anarchist society as anyone talks about, market or anti-capitalist ... through adherence to Xeer as a system, the Somali people are living a better life than they had before the collapse of government. I'm willing to entertain the idea that not all stateless societies will be instantly better than governed societies ... but not all methods of governance is automatically *better* than a stateless society. Many people gloss over, or outright have no idea that Somali people are better off economically, in terms of safety, and in terms of civil resolution of grievances than they have been in decades. Leeson's paper on this gives us a lot of insight into the area that many westerners simply don't know.  &gt; Indicators of Somali welfare remain low in absolute terms, but compared to their status under government show a marked advance. Under statelessness life expectancy in Somalia has grown, access to health facilities has increased, infant mortality has dropped, civil liberties have expanded, and extreme poverty (less than $1 PPP/day) has plummeted. In many parts of the country even security has improved. In these areas citizens are safer than they’ve been in three decades (UNDP 2001). Somalia is far from prosperous, but it has made considerable strides since its government collapsed 15 years ago.  The paper is working off of ideas kicked around by DeLong (he of Krugman sidekick fame) and Schleifer, in their "Princes and Merchants" work comparing the stateless societies of European history to ruled societies of the time, and progress there in absolute terms, as well as the analysis of Somalia's lack of similarities to Mosselle and Polak's [predatory primitive state model](http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/cwlcwldpp/1158.htm) out of Yale.  Leeson's paper is available for everyone without access to academic journals at his site:  http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_Off_Stateless.pdf

If you really get so upset from the DAE subreddit, why not just unsubscribe from it? No one's forcing you to read all the submissions...
I'd suggest a 'powerful' antidepressant. Why not? You've got nothing to lose, right. I'm not sure where you are, but find a doc / order online. Try one of the MAOI's - Parnate or Nardil are the brand names. Most docs in the US will try to get you on one of the more expenseive SSRIs, but they don't work so well for severe depressives. Yes, the MAOIs have some nasty contraindications, but if you're already that close to giving in, not a big deal, right!  Sometimes when your at the end of your rope, you can take risks that might be otherwise avoided in more normal circumstances. Use it to your advantage.   Build up to the max dose over a period of a few weeks. At this point, don't worry too much about being conservative. Your doctor is concerned about their own liability, not about you. These things take a while to kick in, but more often than not, you'll wake up one day and feel a lot better. A few weeks later, you have a new lease on life. Use it to get to a better point where you'll be happier, cause the 'euphoria' they give won't last forever, but they'll give you a good chance and that push you may need.  Good luck, man!

I suppose I can really only speak for myself.   I've always found it weird to make a sport out of guns that are designed to shoot people. To me, those tools are only appropriate in military and law-enforcement contexts. When you celebrate them and turn target practice into a public sport, you serve to engender a pro-gun culture in your society. Some would argue that having more guns and more gun-minded people around leads to more gun-related deaths. [Others would disagree.](http://www.youtube.com/user/NRAVideos#play/all/CDC4F21FD89BD3A6-all/0/acokf3c-D3k)

I've done this. It was really easy. After I did it, I still had the local Bishop's two helpers come by to say hi and I told them I had myself removed from the records. Dunno if their last-ditch effort was standard procedure or if they really didn't know, but I haven't been bothered since.
When it's backed up with facts, it isn't fearmongering.

My expertise is in markets, trading, charts, technical analysis, fundamental analysis.  As one observes the data from my view point, obvious signs and patterns emerge.  They are just as valid and maybe more so than much of the macroeconomic theories and models.  Personally, I have neither the time nor inclination to study economics as an academic venture, at least not in the great detail that a life devoted to it would require.  However, I have explored various economic ideas popular in universities, compared them to actual events, such as the S&amp;P500, Gold, Dollar, etc and found them to be remarkably NOT useful.  What I have found useful in explaining the general trends are people such as Minsky and Keynes.  Keynes was a very successful trader, he had his hand on the pulse of economic activity and became wealthy.  You might say he put his money where his mouth was.  Keynes was a true capitalist who knew how to work the system for profit.  You might say Keynes merged trading with economics.  His was a practical approach without the total dependence on equational proofs that today's economists insist on.  If it works, you do not need the math completely worked out.  And you certainly do not need to know the reason for why things are the way they are.  You just need to recognize that certain things do happen, whether you can rationalize it or not.  Case in point. The current low on March 6th 2009 was a 62% retracement of the bull move when it took off in 1982 to the high in 2007.  This is a Fibonacci ratio often used in chart analysis.  This is also 25 years minus 10 days.  The 2007 high was exactly 5 years to the day from the bottom of the Dot Comm bust Oct11th 2002 - Oct10 2007.  This is an anniversary series date that is often observed and popularized by W.D. Gann in the 1930's.  Observed patterns in Price and Time do not fit easily into equations to-date, at least not publically, Goldman Sachs program trading no doubt incorporates some of these lessor known mathematical models.  The issue is that today's colleges do not have courses in the types of market analysis used by the successful traders who make money trading.  These traders do not make their money churning trades for commissions.  It is still a closed world, for the most part, with generations of traders passing on practical knowledge of actual market patterns that are discernable to the trained eye.  Great effort is needed to discover what has already been discovered at times.  The many get rich quick schemes effectively hide the few valid methods out there.  You will spend thousands on books, software, and conferences before you stumble upon the pearls of wisdom.  If you have any interest I can direct you to a few areas for investigation.  Bryce Gilmore had the most to offer from a practical stand point.  Bryce does not suffer fools easily and swears like a sailor.  So do not try to bluff this guy.

I'm right there with you on the preference for a heady high, not a couch-lock stone.  The only time I smoke tobacco is in my hookah, and that, like the spliff example above, is primarily for the social aspect. It's a great way to get people together, and talking too!

In nature, some kind of justice is often a good survival strategy for individuals and their community. Suppose an ape lets a rival repeatedly kill his children; his genes won't spread very far. But if he seeks revenge and kills his rival, he will be able to have offspring and thus evolution will favour him. Similarly, communities that cooperate and strengthen alliances do better than those that don't.  We have therefore evolved the feelings that people sometimes *deserve* certain treatment, whether it be vengeance or gratitude. Religious people often think that these feelings have no justification without absolute moral law. But if we consider human happiness, security and social stability to be self-justifying, then it's easy to see why justice logically follows. The reasons why justice was beneficial to our evolutionary ancestors still apply today. Justice (such as the imprisonment of criminals) has three purposes: protection of ourselves and society, rehabilitation of the criminal, and deterrence to future criminals.
Thanks!

Like I said, it's not really taming them.  They are trained but never tame. We work hands-on with them because when done correctly personal interaction can be one of the greatest forms of enrichment for an animal.  We become their buddy.  One of the best benefits of proper hands-on work outside of the cat's mental health is the stress free ease of a physical check up.  I've removed thorns, cleaned wounds, cleaned ears, put in eye medication, ear medication, given pills, and found physical issues BEFORE they became expensive problems.

Don't immediately ban people for using exploits. If you kick someone from a server, that usually enough to get them to stop. I sometimes use exploits on pub servers, but I'll stop if a mod simply *tells me to stop*.  If you kick someone and they come back and start doing it again, though, then feel free to ban them.

It doesn't say too much about who got which updates but it does mention that Hamilton had a revised exhaust system and bodywork at the Nürburgring but that it wasn't used on both cars until Hungary. I'm pretty sure that they had different front wings at Silverstone but my memory fails me now. EDIT - I forgot to mention Hamilton getting a short wheel base chassis at the European GP.

you've given up hope? I once met a man that escaped Vietnam by lying under a canvass Topped with fish and ice for three days while crossing the north china sea. he eventually got to San Fransico and eventually to DC. he founded his own business and made millions-a true story. but it's not about $, it about making oppourtunities and seizing the day. there are many great countries and places  to live. no one country is singularly better than another. but you can live the life you want here if you are persistent . don't make decisions about what to do with your life, make decisions about who you are.   to answer your question: France. a great country. but you'll despair of that in no time.
Why rein them in?  I'd rather watch them implode into lunacy.  They are becoming potentially dangerous, however.  It's just a matter of time until a violent act happens.  I doubt the President would be assassinated, however, I wouldn't be surprised if a Senator or other influential official were.  They are becoming more radical and crazy by the minute because they are being rooted on by Beck and the other TV crazies.
Get a small Japanese car. They are the most reliable according to a variety of surveys. Don't buy brand new because you'll be paying a premium but don't buy a very old one. Something like a 5 years old civic would be a good bet.   Whatever car you get, the running costs will surprise you and not in a good way. It's an endless sequence of replacing tyres, brake pads, oil changes, various repairs for crap that inevitably breaks down and of course gasoline. Budget about $2000 per year in running costs excluding your gasoline and your repayments (assuming you're going to buy on credit).  Enjoy the feeling of independence that car ownership gives you. It will wane very quickly.

I'm sorry, but you don't quite understand what a psychopath is.   If wars were primarily fought by psychopaths, there would be no use for the elaborate propaganda used to justify them. A psychopath has no use for morally rationalizing his actions.   In some ways, it can be argued that psychopaths are morally superior to those who do the same sorts of things because they have convinced themselves that "it's the right thing to do".

Stop paying taxes then.  All of it goes to "charity" for other people (fixing their roads, giving them meds, educating other people's children) ... that includes some people from the goddamned superpower to the south of you.

My Atheist Testimony.  I was raised in Provo, my dad works at BYU, and have had a very similar life growing up; although I didn't go on a mission.  I am the youngest of 6 children, half of which are apostate. I think you just need to tell them that you don't believe what they believe.  Do your research.  I have read the bible dozens of times, the Book of Mormon as well.  Look into history and find the things that the Mormons sweep under the rug.  (Native Americans in no way are related to Jews, or Arabs.)  (They only gave the priesthood to blacks after the civil rights movement, specifically just after the Washington DC temple was opened, opening them to world scrutiny) etc.  Learn how Joseph Smith was just a lying, cheating, scam artist who was very convincing in his lies.(not unlike a certain science fiction author)  Learn how Christianity in itself is just a rehash of religions thousands of years older than itself.  Get some good arguments under your belt, then when they ask you why you aren't Mormon, reply with some valid arguments that they cannot dispute.  I have done this and my family avoids the topic like the plague.  They know in their hearts that I am right, logic prevails in my life, and I am not driven by fear.  If your reasons are not based in "SIN" then they will have no way to bring you back to the fold. I have 3 children, teach them evolution, the truth about jesus "Santa Clause for adults", dinosaurs, and science.  I teach them "Why" I am an athiest.  I open myself to questions.  I tell them I don't know everything.  But there is no more reason for me to believe in Christ, than Zeus, or Thor, or Budda, or anyone else. There are thousands of "Gods" and I am just an atheist to one more god than they are.  Once they understand why they don't believe in the thousands of other gods out there, they will understand why I don't believe in theirs.  I live a life driven by morals, I love my family, my children, and don't do things I think are wrong (steal, cheat, etc), and so I am happy being an Atheist.  (In the name of Jesus Christ Amen.)

They in no way complement each other. They are two separate definitions of the same word to connotate different meanings. Again let's take this as an example albeit not a great one.   I am an artist. I can create anything  that I wish. I have an idea in my head but it's not defined until I make my creation then I take this idea that I have created and give it names for the various parts. Does this mean that the various parts weren't what I named them before I made the creation? No, it means they are now defined. The sizes and lengths and measurements or any other physical characteristic did not change because it didn't have a name before hand. What I have done is given my creation things by which others can reference it by.  That's how I can argue a 24-hour measurement.  Water into wine as a natural process yes I agree, but from the examples in the bible this wasn't from a natural process but a super natural process.  This is the direct passage from the KJ version of John 2:1-11  &gt;John 2:1-11 (King James Version)  &gt;John 2  &gt; 1And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:  &gt; 2And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.  &gt; 3And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.  &gt; 4Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.  &gt; 5His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.  &gt; 6And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.  &gt; 7Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.  &gt; 8And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.  &gt; 9When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,  &gt; 10And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.  &gt; 11This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.  There is a very interesting wiki discussing the flood that suggest what I understand would happen if such an event as a complete global flood were to occur.  For one nearly all the fish would have died. Second if you take all the water in the atmosphere to create such an event, all animal life would suffocate even humans.   This can be referenced here:  [http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Global_flood](http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Global_flood)  So a global flood doesn't seem possible, but a regional one would be more acceptable given the relativity of the way the world was viewed during the time addressed in the flood.  And I like this observation also from the wiki:  &gt;The Bible also places the date of construction on the Tower of Babel roughly 100 years after the great flood.[25] Saying a population could go from 6 people (Noah and his wife don't count, they didn't have any more children) to enough people to build the Tower of Babel as it is described in the Bible is absurd. This tower was so great that it threatened God, so it must have been greater that the pyramid of Khufu which took 30,000 people to build.[29] Even a growth rate of 500%, which is absurd beyond all imagination, would only produce about half the required people to even begin to think about such a construction project.   Then the virgin birth is more along the lines of what Lucas presented in Star Wars or what?  See I was hoping for more than a god of the gaps placement then this, but didn't expect a different result truly. Honestly what is to say that if there was such an entity as god that it would have to be existent on a singular plain of reality? What is to say that god is in a human form? What is to say that god even follows our physical rules?
Get something 3-5 years old.  That's old enough that the depreciation curve will be flattening out, and not old enough that the car should be starting to need work.  Plus, you'll get most of the things people expect: cup holders, CD player, side air bags, etc.  That said, I have to offer the following anecdote: when we were relocating a couple of years ago, we had to leave a couple of our cars behind for a few months until we got settled.  When I flew back to pick up our 2004 Honda Civic hybrid, I started it up, backed it out of the garage, and discovered the motor controller module was dead.  Fortunately, my wife had argued me into getting the extended warranty for the car, so I only wound up paying about $15 of the $3800+ bill.  However, when I discovered the Honda wouldn't make the trip, I immediately fired up the other car.  It started immediately and didn't give me any trouble over the course of the three-day drive back home.  The car?  A 1987 Porsche 944S with over 120K miles.  Moral of the story: Consider spending a little more money and getting a better car -- they're worth it in the long run.  FWIW, I actually spent less money for the Porsche than I did for the Honda!
So what are you going to do with your gun?  Seriously, I'm curious why you think you need your gun to survive sand and grime, in an everyday situation. If you are suggesting that you might use it in terrible conditions because of necessity (armed revolt?), I'd respond that such a far-fetched, future scenario doesn't warrant forgoing rifles like the AR-15.

I fucked up again haha. Not afraid to admit it. Yeah, I actually think people do approve of the show. Isn't entrapment illegal? The show does nothing illegal or how else is the police involved? Also, people don't see it as entrapment. A lot of people don't really know the exact definition of entrapment. People are stupid. People see the show as ridding the world of evil.  Your problem is looking at the viewership. You can't seem to get it through your head that viewership isn't that important. Instead what is important is how the average American feels about what the show does. I am using personal opinion and my expertise in marketing and psychology of people. My life is based around how people think, I spend all day trying to find ways to market shit to people. I'm positive American's are fine with screwing over suspected pedophiles.  I'd like to know why you have so much faith in society? I guess it's just the optimism that most redditors have.
The study does not differentiate between people carrying guns because they were looking for trouble (criminals) and those who carry guns because they are prepared for trouble (CCW holders).  How many of the shooting victims were shot by police?  This is a joke.

Affluence? No one said that. A certain comfort and security about that level of comfort.  North Korea is probably at least a _little_ bit different than Alabama, because only in one of the two is the government famous for executing people who speak out against it. I'm sure that counts as a distinction, especially when people talk about the "security" of a place they live. I'm not sure living in North Korea even _counts_ as living in a "safe" place, buddy.  If you happen to be impolite to your neighbor, their son is not going to come home, and there wasn't even the implication that, when that child does get home, there is a threat to you. The implication should have been that a family is risking something most precious to it, one of its children, _for you_. Maybe children aren't special to you, but they are special to a lot of other people, and, if you find one of those people to whom children are special, and tell them they have to risk the _very life_ of that special person, risk it for everyone else, well, certainly you aren't going to want a lot of smartass kids trying to tell you your son has no business killing poor, brown foreigners as part of they most senseless and deadly episode of American adventurism in the country's 220 year history, since that just wouldn't be polite.

Well, I was in love with the girl already. She was still getting over her long time ex. We worked at the same place at the time... I was at work. She called and said she was about to arrive at work, asking if I could come down and meet her at her car. I went down, got in the car and I forgot the small talk (there wasn't much), but she told me she was pregnant. She said she didn't know what she wanted to do yet, but she just found out and wanted to tell me. I tried to best the best guy I could ever be and told her I loved her, I respected her and that whatever she decided I would support. Emily is now 10 months old last Saturday and I couldn't be happier. We all live together and just about two weeks ago my girl told me she feels differently than before. She wants a real relationship wih me now and feels her heart has mended.  Took a long time, but I'm happy. :) (well, happier I should say. Always happy with my daughter). Good luck to you.

My penis shriveled into the confines of my pelvis as I hunched over uncontrollably, my chest compressing to release a wave of hot, foul breath from beneath a quivering set of lips. My eyes gained a mind of their own as I fought to watch but they fought to recede far away at some point realizing they were stationary and my will power was too strong. I then pressed backspace. I hadn't even noticed that my heart beat had slowed down, or that I was entering the beginning stages of a seizure brought on by an evolutionary instinct to defend ones mind of brain damage while viewing such cruel things. I now feel as if something inside me died and withered away and realize why whoever created me made sure I was born in the last dying throes of the 80's, they were just being kind, because right around the corner was where the real cool started, these guys will never be able to top Zack and Screech, Carlton and Will Smith and Nickelodeons old after school line up.

MMOs take a lot of work.  Itd be more feasible to just make a multiplayer game that plays like a MMO, but with the number of players more like a fps.  Like, just make the battlegrounds. Leave out all of the quests, the big worlds, the leveling system, character specialization, guilds, ingame chat, hell, maybe even leave out having continuous characters and just let players have a name, then choose class for the game at the start of the match.

Martin fowler has a pretty good paper on it: http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html  Probably more about the mechanics than the purpose though I suppose.

Yep. Just moved to a new place where my car is even closer than before. I locked it after I got out, and probably as I went in through the door, and then 20 minutes later because I wasn't ABSOLUTELY SURE that I had locked it. Pretty sure I did. Wouldn't bet my life on it.  Wouldn't want anyone to steal my Tim Horton's garbage or my burned CDs that now skip.
If that's the case I find it strange that you're still a mod of anything.

Yeah :)  I get these prices from the Save-A-Lot (discount grocery store) and the local vegetable market. The Walmart, Publix and Winn Dixie charge like 4-6 dollars a pound for even their crappy cuts of meat.   You also have to think that, while cost of living here is crazy low, most of the jobs here don't pay more than minimum wage. A person lucky enough to score a job making more than $10 an hour is considered rich by this town's standards.
i assume most doctors are not like this...  that said, i can't say i'm shocked... i mean who didn't meet pre-med students back in college that were totally in it for the money, prestige, and other material gains that stood to receive should they become a dr.

Great to hear...I did the same exact thing yesterday, except I moved to Bangkok, Thailand.  It's my first morning here (as for why I'm on reddit, I'm jetlagged as hell and trying to pass the early morning hours).  I plan to teach.
You sound like someone who would say that the song "Brand New Key" is terrible because it is out of tune.   Edit:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p02DgHeGdyI
I usually try to answer technical questions using two rules that seem to produce the best outcome.  - Answer literally.  - Put as much effort into the answer as was put into the question.  The second rule often leads to the first. If someone just needs to find "the next hurdle" they might ask a very short, maybe not very focused question.  It helps to answer these literally rather than pestering the questioner "why" because it has a better outcome.  For example:  Q.  How do I get a directory listing in C?  A.  Use the system API of your platform that returns a directory listing.  This prompts the questioner to understand that a) this is platform-specific, and b) that there is such a thing as a system API.  Hopefully the questioner does some googling and comes back with more specific questions.  This is superior to "why??" cockblocking because it takes less time and actually might produce useful results.
Nice try, thieves.

Equal footing would mean american backing for arms deals and military aid. This is about no one coming anywhere close to Isreal's capabilities and getting any nuke even without a delivery vehicle would be terrifying to Isreal simply because they have no allies in the region. Isreal's situation is shit for them because they have treated everyone in the middle east exactly as they would have been treated and the US govt have given them the ability to not even have to try to make peace. really there isn't any fix for this without having a generation free of bombings and bloodshed.

Heh well unless said floormat was also under the brake pedal.... There's no other reason the floormat would contribute to no brakes. He may have finally though to switch it off and lost his power brakes. Or ridden the brakes until they were searing hot and useless.  Not that we know.
I started with Aaron Hillegass' book, which made it pretty easy.  Later on, I got some other book, when things got serious.  It's across town in my office, but I'll try to remember to post the title out here tomorrow.  Yeah, it can get that way if you're trying to have a set of your own classes that drive your program.  I try to keep the central flow of logic in the AppController or WindowController subclass, and have those classes act as the master of any objects I create to facilitate parts of the program that should be in separate classes.  It's not hard when you consider that most of an OS X program is about responding to user input, then processing.  Some things are a bitch, like throwing up a barber pole when you're doing something that is going to take a while, having to make a background thread, and setup thread-safe communication, but once you learn it, it's cut/paste and edit.  Sometimes it is inevitable.  I wrote a cash register in Cocoa, which was based on my own execute to completion, finite state machine driven task kernel that runs in a background thread.  So there were a couple of layers between the UI and devices, and the core logic. I ended up with a lot of reflector methods that would call across from the background kernel to the AppController in the foreground thread, for updating the display.  Getting input into the kernel was easy, it was just create a task for the kernel and queue it.  It was a very Rube Goldbergesque type of system.  But the simplicity of having events dispatched into a FSM was a much larger benefit than the nuisance of the extra methods and call gates.
It may be outdated, but it does make sense. An arrow would help though.
You have no idea how much I hate "meme"s. They're the equivalent of a bad inside joke, except the "inside" is a hundred million fucking morons you've never met on the internet.

Hey...  I almost killed myself at 19 too.  You know what?  The past six years have been WAY better.  WAYYYY better.  Wanna know why I almost killed myself?  My best friend dropped dead.  My boyfriend was cheating on me.  I wasn't doing well in school.  I had acne.  I thought I was unlikeable.  Guess what though?  It was a challenge to stay alive.  The best way to say "Fuck you world" is to keep going.  Now, I am really glad I did.  I haven't even had a good day today, but I'm glad to be alive.  I have to go help my best friend take care of her newborn tomorrow.  That is worth living for.
I thought the same thing about the pirate bay case. I just get the feeling that iinet wont walk out of this smiling, which is a shame cos I think they are a great ISP 
I have an ex girlfriend who went down a similar path. She one day decided she was going to be a professional photographer. I didn't see anything special in her photos (just pictures of trees and shit) and I was sure she would fail after a month or so. But she didn't care what I thought and just kept taking pictures. Within a month of her epiphany she was telling everyone that she was a professional photographer and placing ads to get work. I was truly embarrassed for her. She landed a couple of weddings which blew my mind. I looked at the photos before she sold them and I was unimpressed. I knew the recipients would hate them and that would be the end of her photography career. We broke up shortly after but I still keep in contact with her daughter. That was 7 years ago. Today she has a studio and is booked almost every weekend. At least that's what she tells everyone.

I live in a country where people consume way more veal than beef because they believe it to be easier to digest and therefore healthier on the colon. They also don't trust food developed in a laboratory. Cargill's invention might triumph in the US, but Spain can't be won with cryptic pseudo-foods.
Hahaha, this is exactly what I thought. Looks like she's going in for a D with her left hand.   Also, she plays guitar. Has no pulse. She's a vampire musician? Maybe her stage name is Lestat. 
No pain, no gain.
a person "being postmodern" would not make a value judgment that one way of accessing truth is superior to other methods of revelation of truth, and by proxy that certain truths ought be privileged over sub-altern truths. One of the almost universal questions of postmodern thought is 'why ought some experiences and truths be given a hegemonic position in relation to other ways of knowing' thus your claim seems out of your self-described character. A short, unwarranted claim from a postmodern position would be more like "philosophy has never existed!" or (and much worse) a misapplication of some theoretical physics would fit nicely: "Just as 20th century physicists proved time and space was relative to frame of reference, so too has philosophy demonstrated that all scientific conclusions are themselves founded upon cultural truths and thus only an extension of western man's hegemony!!!"

My now-wife said "I'm going outside for a smoke, and then I gotta tell you something."   Keep in mind that WHERE you tell him will forever be associated with this moment.  If it's on a walk, you can pass by there with the stroller in a year, saying " hey, remember when..."  Hopefully it'll work out for the best.  If this guy is truly awesome, and you're already shacked up, then it shouldn't be the end of his world.  It's the next level, congrats, and it'll change your life in the best possible ways.
I commend you for all the effort you went through. I don't have the technology nor the effort to do all that. 
Trolling is about getting a reaction and if he's getting newspapers and radio talking about the signs, it was a successful troll.
&gt;&gt;that objective truth requires universal agreement &gt; &gt;I never claimed otherwise.   Then I don't understand why you responded to my post with:  &gt;Those are claims about the world, and they **do** need to be universally in agreement with the world to be true.  My only point to begin with was that objective truth does not require universal agreement. I mean, if you don't disagree with that, then you had no reason for jumping in. Surely you *must* disagree with it, otherwise your behavior makes no sense.  &gt;I said that objective truth is not analogous to morality. That, as Gareth321 argued, morality is inherently bound with subjective, cultural factors - that to say a morality is true is a domain error - we can only say that it is true that a particular person adheres to a particular morality, or that a particular moral code exists, but isn't especially privileged except relative to a particular person.  Now you're addressing a topic I never addressed. I never defended moral realism or anti-realism. I only defended the claim that objective truth does not require universal agreement.  But I think you're contradicting yourself. Now you're defending some sort of noncognitivist view according to which moral judgments are not truth-apt. But earlier you were defending a descriptive analysis of moral judgments which reduces them to statements about the speaker's moral beliefs. The two views are incompatible, and obviously you can't defend both.  &gt;When you say "The earth is round", you are saying "The earth is round is True". When you say "People should eat cheese", you are not saying "people should eat cheese is true" (what exactly would that even mean?) You are saying "It is right that People should eat cheese".  A moral realist would say the two cases are handled exactly alike. "'The earth is round' is true" ascribes truth to the sentence "the earth is round". Likewise, "'People should eat cheese' is true" ascribes truth to the sentence "people should eat cheese". Both come out true depending on the way the world is: depending on whether the sentences correspond to the objective astronomical facts or the objective moral facts. So far nothing you've said casts doubt on moral realism.  &gt;No - we are disagreeing about what is right, not what is true. About what people should do, not what facts are correct. You are wrong by my moral belief and vice-versa, but those judgements are only relevant between parties. There is nothing outside myself I can point to to justify why I have that belief, or any sense that I can demonstrate that it exists.  This is precisely what is denied by the moral realist. A moral realist understands moral disagreements as factual disagreements, not as mere disagreements in attitude. So you're simply begging the question against moral realism.  &gt;Because it adds nothing. The statement "My morality is true" adds nothing to "this is my morality". It makes no additional difference to our logic, how we make decisions, or even seem to have any real meaning: when we say other things are true, we have a method for validating them against the world, here there's no such objective reality to test them against (as there would be if they were universal). Since it adds nothing, Occam's razor shreds this.  You're mixing up two points. First is the claim that truth-ascriptions in morality add no content to personal expressions of moral commitment. This begs the question against moral realists, who think moral judgments (and of course truth-ascriptions) add something very important: an assertion that certain objective moral properties are instantiated. The second point is the Occam's razor point, which contradicts the first point: if moral realism provides no extra content, then there is nothing for Occam's razor to shave away. Also, this is the first time that the point has made an appearance: so far all you've done is assert that moral realism is false without providing any reason to doubt it. Taking the point on its own merits, it does have some force against non-naturalist versions of moral realism, though non-naturalists might provide counterbalancing reasons in support of their view. But it clearly says nothing against naturalistic moral realism: there's nothing metaphysically extravagant about moral facts which are nothing more than natural facts.
yeah, but then corporations will include all kinds of extra costs to not go over the $200,000 limit

It is interesting that it works out like that. Go figure.

But then it seems like consensus is very important to what it means to own property.  In fact, consensus would decide what property and ownership means.   
It's (still) true (if you have no idea how to run a proper system). I don't remember the last time I saw a BSOD.
yeah - bpm2000 hit it on the nose there - I dont use the buses all that often, driving around is my preference.  Over here on the eastside, rush hour is usually 630 am to 9 or so, and then at night from 4 to 7... dunno about in Seattle itself though.  Avoid driving over I-90 bridge or the 520 bridge (the only 2 bridges over the lake) if at all possible, horrendous traffic.  nightmarish even.  unless you have calves of steel, i wouldnt recommend walking everwhere, lots of hills.  A lot of people do bike instead of drive - a co-worker bikes in, he rides about 15 miles a day... theres several biketrails (paved &amp; graveled) that run by major highways.
Tips are not income.  They are optional rewards for exceptional service.  If they are relying on tips, then they aren't charging enough in their rates.  I find it odd that the same people who bitch about hidden fees in phone service and airline tickets accept "mandatory" hidden fees just because it's called a tip.
The crap that is reported on most major news sight is hardly news, they report on what the majority of the idiots in this country want to hear about.  I don't want to get my news from a source that considers celebrity gossip to be more important than real news.

Sorry for double reply - not comfortable discussing it "in public" too.  My suspicion is  * 1) Misunderstood by alot of people, yet very common. * 2) Can be misdiagnosed as both depression and bipolar disorders, as well as anxiety disorders. * 3) Can co-exist with both depression and bipolar disorders. * 4) Long-term untreated symptoms can lead to depression. * 5) Not often considered in adults.

The Yaris is pretty flimsy (see the crash tests), and if you're not really into the extra features, you can buy a basic Corolla for about the same price.

That's really not how peer review works. The reviewers have to give *reasoned objections* to the paper that the authors can then overcome.   Heck, I'd even be willing to accept something that was rejected from a peer review paper along with a (authenticated by a neutral 3rd party) copy of some objections that are completely unreasonable.   If the reviewers are just saying "you're a moron, get out of here", that's one thing. If they are saying, "your analysis is wrong and here's why", that's the way the review process works. The authors need to respond to that or they have *zero* credibility.  Unlike Slashdot and Reddit, peer review doesn't involve downvoting by popular demand.
Probably not really relevant to those outside the US. Possibly the red cross/crescent charter or the UN Declaration of Human Rights would be more useful?

Some of my suggestions: Relax. Don't talk fast. Take your time. Ask him questions and let him talk. Let him lead when possible.  Don't stare at him and bat your eyes (that's psycho speak.) Be real but don't open your heart all at once on him. Too much too fast will scare many men off. Be independent and don't cling (again, scary.) Let him be himself and don't put words in his mouth. Let him make the moves if you are really into him.  Now that said, you never really know what will happen. That's the exciting part about dating. Be prepared to go with the flow but use caution if he wants to move faster than you. We men like to think we are in control but many times we just key off what the lady does and says.  I know others may disagree with some or all of what I say but fuck it. I am old school.  Last but not least: At least make a token offer to pay for your half of everything. This shows your independence but also releases him from the idea that since he paid for everything then you'll have to put out. Unless, that is, you want to. Hehe.
I don't really get what your point is.   I may disagree with rape, but I think it's not my job to go into a rape-sex-stories forum and start calling everyone sick disgusting perverts.  1) Because it's completely pointless   and   2) It's fantasy. Perhaps disgusting to my moral code, but it's nevertheless fantasy. Just thoughts. And I make it a point never to attack or penalize someone for just thinking.  Doing otherwise sets up a very dangerous precedent I refuse to go one baby toenail toward.
