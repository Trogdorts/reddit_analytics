They take place among the stars but I see your point. You interpret it another way.
Actually I think in the third photo he looks down even farther since he has turned more towards the girls. His chin is closer to his chest in picture three. He is trying to be inconspicuous and not have them get a good look at him. He is being hit more by the bright sun which makes his jacket and everything lighter and makes his hood kind of fade in color and definition too. I believe his hood is still on his head in picture three.  Edit: I believe he is wearing a hat, camo pattern, not a hood.
It's pretty well known and it was a paid product placement. Hamilton advertised the watch around the movie and had an Interstellar page on their website. The biggest product placement was the Carhartt jacket though.   Brands send old merch all the time by the way for movies. Just watch Stranger Things for tons of examples of that. Eggos are prominently featured as Eleven's favorite food.
You know we have laws against that currently correct? Or are you just willfully ignorant of gun laws in the US.

Then we need a massive effort to retrofit and encourage the retrofit of those things into businesses.  Keeping in mind that bringing everyone up to code in this would also likely tear down a number of buildings and displace folks.

"I mean... uh... nevermind"   =  Kazuma: "(sees the blood) uhhh...... yeah so anyway you DO have it good, you bastard!"
as a daughter of my non biological father,   1) that opinion of hers is true and will not waver. She might get mad at you for something else, might not talk to you for years of you have wronged her that badly, but she is saying that so confidentally now, take it at face value and dont question her on this regard anymore. If you do that might be the only way to push her too far.  2) if she ever were to want to meet her biological father, it is curiosity, not an attempt to replace you. You are irreplaceable to her already.  3) your ex is an asshole, sorry she made you worry that much and tried to hurt you. I hope you can sort out your feelings soon.  4) i look a lot like my non biological dad. I still find it more than just funny that him and I are the only ones having curly blond hair. All the others are straight, thick and darker. Edit: what I wanted to say is: she might look like you because she makes the same faces and thats nurture. She might make the same gestures, that is nurture. She has your intellogence because you spark her curiosity for learning and encourage her. You are her biggest supporter and her biggest role model if she takes so much after you. And all what she is like you, is PURELY out of true, pure and innocent love. I am serious here. What good is a child that has the same hair or nose if it resents you and tries to forcefully be the exact opposite of you because it is difficult (dont want to say a child can be hating their parent except for the parent being abusive). It is one of the biggest love letters if she is like you. And again: looking similar can happen without DNA too -- the way she takes care of herself, her muscles she uses while making faces will tug on her bones a bit. The look and spark in the eyes of people. Those are far from DNA. Please dont reduce her to DNA. She is yours.  4) NURTURE &gt; nature. She being like you, behaving like you, having personality traits like you is because you have been an awesome role model to her, you have always been one of her most lived and trusted and respected humans on earth and thus, she has been taking a lot of your mannerisms when she was little. You will be able to parent a really wonderful kid and it will not matter a few years down the line what your ex did or didnt prove. Your daughter might even have a better relationship to you than her in a few years (as do I at the moment).   5) though my dad has always known he wasn't my father (i was already 1y/o, duh!) he has been there in my life. He kind of adopted me legally (he is written on my paperwork) and I am glad he is. He was disciplining me, encouraging me, listening to me. He did lots of shit as well, as a normal parent always does and shitty parents do more, but that never made him less of a father to me.  I found out when I was 14. It took just as many years to find out who my biological father is and I still havent made the decision if I want to meet him. But after the stories I heard, I for myself would love to prove to myself that NURTURE &gt; nature.  Enjoy your daughter and dont fred the DNA.  Edit: talk to a lawyer regarding custody. DNA test doesnt automatically take away your privileges and responsibilities, if it does: fucked up system. But the lawyers know best. First impressions might be found here: r/legaladvice  Edited more on point 4.
Sounds like me. Also self taught, started when I was 16 and I’m 29 now and its still a bit frustrating. I got so frustrated when I was younger that I stopped for a long time.   Now that I’ve gotten a-lot better, it’s really fun just jamming for hours or to a backing track or with friends. I can finally play along to songs I like! Much fun.  Best advice I can give you is to actually Teach Yourself to play and don’t just practice random stuff haphazardly.   Have a diverse exercise cheat sheet so you can practice more things together and not get bored,  Edit: I wouldn’t use youscian at all really. And use resources like justinguitar as a text book you can refer to for theory not for practice. Practice what you like and you won’t get bored.

I didn’t want to ruin my life either. Nobody wants to ruin their life. The reality is, I have a disease called alcoholism. If I didn’t treat it, my life would continue to get worse.  Weird thing is I didn’t want to treat.  I thought I was choosing to drink, the reality was that I had lost that choice years prior. If your wife is anything like my girlfriend was, she will leave you, my girlfriend did.  She didn’t take half my stuff though I had nothing she wanted.   The good news is that in theory at least, you can get off the elevator anytime you want.  The reality for me was that it took a year living in a car, unemployed and unemployable to get the willingness to do this. I didn’t have the guts to panhandle so it was rough.  During the last 4 years I drank I thought I was willing to get sober but didn’t do what was suggested, and my life continued to get worse.  Once I committed to do this thing my life started changing. I’m pretty happy to live in a house today.   AA isn’t the only to get and stay sober, it is what worked worked for me.  I don’t know about other ways, but I sure see a lot of success in AA.  Give it a shot for 90 days, I’ve never seen it hurt anyone.   The reality is that if you are an alcoholic and you don’t do something, your life today is probably as good as it will ever be.

I would actually just like to say that there are other possibilities at play here.  I laughed when I read this, because just today I downloaded tinder because we were discussing dating at our age, and the single people were saying  it's difficult to find cool people. So I downloaded it, swiped through, and deleted all within 10 minutes.  I have 0 interest in other woman, and I love my wife, and there's no way I'm cheating on her....but I still downloaded it.   Btw my wife knows, and thinks it's harmless fun.   So anyway, she might be cheating, but no need to go crazy just yet.

"Stop loss" while selling: if the price goes as low as this, sell the shares. The price that you select should be lower than the current market price  "Limit" while selling: If the price reaches minimum this, sell the shares.

Yes. Why shame people for sex at all
NTA 100%  Who in their right mind thinks it's okay for a 12 year old to have sex toys? It's one thing to masturbate, but practically giving your daughter or son sex toys is crossing the line.   The fact that most people here think that's this is perfectly okay really shows how far off the deep end Reddit has gone. We're not talking about a 16 or 17 year old teenager here. We're talking about a 12 year old. **That's 6th or 7th grade.**  Who's paying for this, anyways? You have to be 16 to get a job at most places, 14 at a minimum. The fact that parents would take such an active role in their preteen child's sexuality is...concerning to say the least.

&gt; Industry in China is still deeply entwined with the state. The notion that China just suddenly became capitalist is pervasive and misguided.  That's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism.   &gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production  No, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism.   &gt;The Chinese government and communist party directly run the economy   CCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic.   &gt;China is actually less socialist than Nordic model countries in the realm of wealth redistribution and tax rates.  Social democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets.   &gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.  Not even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings.   Even under a "state owned system", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own.   To put it simply, you are incorrect in your assessment. China is a ruthless, authoritarian capitalist society that will break any rules needed to get ahead. That's why they are where they are in such a short span of time.

&gt;However comes into being doesn't properly apply to how we understand the universe.  Our current scientific understanding is that there is no point in time when there wasn't a universe.  This gets tricky sure as this isn't necessarily implying an infinite time into the past. You’ve just either strawmanned or misinterpreted by position.  The universe may very well be infinitely old.  That would have no effect on my argument.  I am not talking about infinite temporal regression, but rather a regression of hierarchical cause. Furthermore your idea of how change is defined isn't a scientific one either.  Non-being to being aren't scientific terms   I never said they were.  Lots of things are not scientific terms.  But that does not make them less valid.  They are *philosophical* terms, which science is a sub grouping under. &gt;nor does potentiality and actuality exist in the way you are using them either.  Proof?  &gt;Because here is the thing.  A lot of this argument relies on an area where we are very much bound by the limitations of our ability to examine it.  It is easy to say that some thing can't be the case but science is always built on the idea that more information may arise that will change views.  As such the claims about what matter can't or can do and the earliest moments of reality are literally using our ignorance to try to argue a position.  You are continuing to misrepresent my argument.  I am not talking about a temporal series of events.

Bought a brand mew Lews speed stick today and was super excited to use it as I’ve never spent that much on a rod/reel before.  5 casts in i thought i was setting the hook but ended up snagging an underwater log and broke my tip off. I was super pissed off.   I switched to my trusty ugly stik and caught this baby on a weightless zoom horny toad and 4/0 hook just dragging by the weed line. Needless to say, i completely forgot about the wasted $80 and was reminded why i love these fish so much.  Now i just have to find a new rod to put my lews mach 2 reel on

There’s a difference between answering politely and being an asshole. Normal people try to be mature and realistic. I’m not asking you to be over the top optimistic or anything.

The "AC" stuff seemed pretty sparse in Odyssey, just filler stuff to be able to associate the game with AC IMO.  I don't feel as if they were restricted by it at all, but at the same time I didn't see the purpose of including it.  Odyssey would have no issues being a standalone game and I think Ubi is popular enough to be able to introduce a new IP.

Of course I'll think more about it after I start working, right now I need to focus on my studies. Thanks for answering.

They would still die, yes. We eat them, we use them to live, you can’t say anything that will make me change my mind, so don’t even try.
My boss provided the condition that in exchange for letting me mess around outside trying to catch him for hours while technically being on the clock (lol) that I would have to give him said manager’s name as his middle name, so his middle name is Roberdt.
What exactly offended you that you are calling him rude?
She was a noonwraith, right? Was that the one in the fields outside of Novigrad?  Noonwraith quests are always so sad. She didn’t deserve that and I’m glad Gerald got to help her move on, even if he had to do it with his silver sword.

Sure.  One I bet Epic had in place as well.  Contracts can be broken and at the end of the day if your reputation is shit, people won't have a lot of faith you'll stick to a contract.

I can see fan theory but not a lot of basis for false
Anhedonia is the inability to experience pleasure.  Nibidda is a sense of revulsion for the clinging aggregates that constitute samsara, which appropriately turns a mind toward the path of the Buddhadharma.  I would say that anhedonia is like getting bored of a video game you don't know how to turn off, abiding in that dissatisfaction, and continuing to play anyway.  Nibbida is the careful analysis of playing a video game, realizing its unreality can never be the foundation of happiness, and learning how to turn it all off.  (This is just spitballing.)

I'm mind blown that she gets an allowance at 23, and she will never learn if daddy keeps rescuing her.  Tell you arent going to combine finances and explain why. Then sit down with her and help her make a budget she can use the Mint app to track if she stays in her budget or not.   Depending on your relationship with her dad this could also be something you talk to him about. Something like this (if its true and you do want a future) I want a future with your daughter but her spending habits concern me. I know that you want to help take care of her and that speaks volumes to your character. However I dont know how we can plan to have a future together and buy a house, plan for a baby, etc. if she is unable to afford her rent but then regularly spends $80 on an article of clothing.

See I presently work two jobs so cooking and meal prep is the hard part. I've spent the past year cutting expenses as much as possible so that I could leave the second one and tonight is actually the last night working security, so I'm trying to work things around to some better habits as we speak.

Yo I’m just asking people what their highest doses are so I at least have an idea what not to surpass to stay safe. I’m not trying impress random people on the internet so chill. I’ve had that specific dose or 1750 mg because it’s approximately the dose of 2 five fluid ounce bottles of Delsym. I’ve gotten a lot of good reviews about that dose. I ask because I know it’s not a game, you can hurt yourself on this substance.
That wasn't the point. Bran's plan was for them to lose. The goal was to get the Night King to come to him, not win the battle. The battle was a diversion. Of course Bran couldn't tell anyone this or else it wouldn't work.

I’m in the process of reading all his book and stories and what I realized is that once you’ve read 10 or 20 you realize all his books are kinda the same except a few. Best thing is to read the famous ones first because they’re the best ones. Do androids dream, we can remember it for you, ubik, scanner darkly, man in the high castle (I didn’t like that one very much though). For me valis is the best. It’s definitely his next level work and also I think some of his best and most original stuff but it has a different theme than the rest of his career. I love pkd but since he constantly uses similar themes and character types not sure of you can do many of his books back to back because they become unmemorable.

Not addressing your questions till you answer what I asked you. Are you older than 18? If you are a teenager, I get it and why you think I would "hate" a videogame (which is incredibly childish and an adult should never say) but I get it.

It dramatically lowers multiple barriers to entry (cost, setup, ease of use), and delivers an uncompromising 6DOF experience. For anyone without a gaming PC, it's the only headset I'd recommend. Even those with a gaming rig might consider it simply due to convenience factors. That said, the Rift-S is more comfortable, and if you are truly graphics obsessed you'll want to try before you buy.

You do realise the crusades were individual events, right? And Jerusalem for the vast majority of the Crusader era was Muslim?   The Kingdom only lasted around 190 years from 1099 to 1291, and prior to that hadn't been ruled by a Christian nation since the Romans / Byzantines lost it in 637.  Out of the last 1400 years it has spent over a thousand of them under a Muslim nation.

You have to practice and play within your ability to see improvement. This is where a lot of people fail. When i first started a month in i did not want to play simple tunes. I wanted to play Zappa.

What kinds of things are you playing/practicing?

He also got married, and they filed jointly for 2018. So his husband's income as a teacher should be in the 2018 number, but not the 2017 number.

For my part, it has everything to do with Dany. Or, rather, Sansa’s obsession with turning everyone against her. I would have zero problems with Sansa in the crypts if not for that completely unnecessary bit of Dany-related conversation. I can’t speak for anyone else who is talking about Sansa in the crypts, but I can’t imagine why anyone would be upset at her being with the rest of the women and children if she hadn’t used the time to take cheap shots.

&gt;If one is making a claim, such as “ God doesn’t exist “  I prefer to phrase it as all gods are imaginary (exist exclusively in the mind). The only way I consider something real (exists independent of the mind) is when there is sufficient evidence of it being real. So far every theist has failed to provide sufficient evidence of any god being or possibly being real. Therefore I treat all gods as imaginary.

I'm not asking it to not be man vs whatever -- that's every story ever. Nor am I asking for the NK to not be a villain. I just hoped his plot would be resolved in a less one-dimensional fashion.  The "kill the head and the body dies" trope is incredibly tired and boring. They couldn't really do anything about that because of how they wrote the episode, but whatever.  The "the villain goes to kill the hero himself, leaving himself vulnerable to attack" trope is incredibly tired, boring, and makes no sense given the NK has no characterization.  The latter -- the NK having little to no character -- is source of one of my major gripes: killing the NK doesn't feel meaningful. He's not an interesting character. He is literally a one-dimensional character whose only goal is to murder humanity, for reasons that are really not themselves that interesting.

&gt; If you remove suicides and gang violence our "gun violence epidemic" suddenly disappears entirely.  Mass-shootings in Universities are not by gangs, nor suicide cases (despite shooters routinely taking their own lives afterwards). It is something that just doesn't happen on the scale it does in America, and a large factor in that is the ease of gun access.  6 people a year (wherever you pulled that stat) is 6 too many.

YTA.   I was thinking about this the other day. How I wish it was normalized for girls to masturbate. Boys start before the age of 12, girls are encouraged not to.  For girls, once you start having sex, it takes a while to warm up to. For the first few years of my sex life it wasnt about me. Hell, I still dont make it about me and I'm 30. I wish I had started masturbating earlier and learned what I liked. And learned that I deserve pleasure and that I can in fact ASK for it. I can Expect it. Sex is a 2 person dance after all.   Though.. is weird to ask your parents to buy. But hey, kudos to raising a child that isnt ashamed to communicate with her parents. Shutting this down now, will shut down her communication with you later. I would not do that

I'm using Intel 4000 HD in a T430 and it's my main machine.  I'm restricted to selecting games that will run ok, there's a fair few out there... With a laptop you're always going to be restricted in some way so it would be better to find out what the bar is that your daughter wants to set eg, minecraft   &amp;#x200B;  I'm playing this atm [https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/) which runs nicely.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm also playing Final Fantasy VII but that makes the CPU run a little hotter.
I brought a big bottle and it lasts 4-5 months and I have hair to my butt. You only need a little bit so I find it totally worth it. A little pricy but when you are only buying it a few times a year it’s not too bad

red damage means YOUR weapon is stronger, and green damage/durability means YOUR weapons is weaker(?) than the one on the ground.

If the battery checks out fine it could also be a burnt up starter. My 70 mercurys starter went tits up 2 weeks ago in the parking lot of the parts store with no warning.

Yeah, I do that too. I also round up the dollar amount of my bills to divide evenly by 5; for example my basic netflix plan isn't $8.99 on my budget sheet, it's a flat $10 and once they decide to raise it up to something like $9.99 or $10.99 I'll change it to $15 on my sheet if I don't cancel my sub by then.

The best part about the sudden popularity is that someone ordered a reprint of Yakuza 1 &amp; 2 on PS2 two years ago so I was able to pick up brand new copies instead of paying $75 when Yakuza 2 used to be worth that much  Of course since I try to play games series in order and the original versions it's going to be awhile before I get to play all the new ones people keep raving about on here. 1 was fun though

Curriculum development. Universities and private schools might be a good place to start, even if they're not local. Also, look into private instruction companies - I worked for one for a little over a year and loved the work and the students. (NB I ended up leaving because they didn't pay commensurate with my title/responsibilities/experience, so heads up for that.)  If you already have some connections, especially within private schools, educational consultant. Students who need to change schools for one reason or another often hire ed consultants to help them make the best choice for their situation.

Where are Bitfinex and Tether based? I thought it was somewhere in Asia. If they had any employees doing their shady business in the U.S., those guys must have known how risky their actions are.

Reddit is much more politically driven, hivemind is much stronger and more passionate. Going against the grain will get you yelled at and people are meaner. Reddit as a company is much more hands on in good and bad ways. Companies use bought accounts and astroturf the front page. I think the difference now is that reddit is much more mainstream. It's become like a lot of the other social networks. Some key people influence reddit a lot now too, for instance "Super Mods." I think these people who game the algorithm are bad for reddit because we don't get to see much diversity of thought on certain subjects anymore.
Biden's got 40% of the base locked up. The other 60% is what they are all nervous about. The Yang gang are former Berners and half of the current Berners aren't going to put up with the DNC shenanigans in 2020. No telling where the other factions go after they get squeezed out too.

Okay WTF how did I never notice that? Seeing it now, that bugs me sooo much
The "downside" is that full-time nudity at home may lead to rebellion as the child gets older.  I personally think the best way is for nudist children to stay nudist is to have nudist peers.   Good friends that they've known for years and have consistently socialized naked with. Even though my daughter grew up in a very clothesfree way (consistent family nudity, consistent nudist resort trips, consistent visits with nudist friends), she dropped out right around puberty.  And I think the main reason was she didn't have nudist friends to counter the effect of being around non-nudist friends.  I knew a nudist teen who had no problems staying nudist through puberty - her best friend was also a nudist.

I’m confused by what you are arguing here.  At a quick glance his minor defensive stats don’t look that good either.  So are you expecting him to be a good job defender?  Or just someone that won’t make this all worse?
The character 令 does bear a meaning similar to "beautiful" in classical Chinese. Here are some examples I thought of:  &gt;子曰：“巧言令色，鲜矣仁。”  &gt;The Master said, "Fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue."  This is from [*Analacts*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analects).  Source: [Wikisource](https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/Confucian_Analects/I).  &gt;夫何瑰逸之令姿，独旷世以秀群。  This is from *The Rhapsody of Leisured Emotions* (闲情赋) by [Tao Yuanming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Yuanming). I cannot find d an "official" translation so here's my stab at it:  &gt;Oh, such an elegant posture, standing out from the mundane world.  On top of the 2 examples, the character 令 is used in honorifics in modern Chinese.
This is great. Good to see everyone’s push home in one place without going through it on the website.

Someone who wishes to use insult and misogynist terms to silence me will get a paragraph of truth. Anyone who replies to another person to "Stop being a whiny bitch" needs to evaluate their character. You lack self control if you speak to anyone in this way online or not, which will bleed into every aspect of your life and result in the quality of your life decreasing due to your own actions. You have come off as an abusive, self centered person who uses coercion to cover up your own incompetence because it is easier to throw insults than to express your disagreement. You are very unlikable for this very reason. I feel sorry for the lack of  growth you likely experience due to not putting effort into managing yourself in a respectful way.
Yes. Definitely
i'm very glad that you liked it, thanks!! But, i'm wondering why this song was playing in your head, because for me it means the opposite of the text. the lyrics are "Do you think you're better off alone?" and it sounds like she is affirming that the person can't be lonely and happy at the same time while the text is saying that, yes, it's ok to live your life solo and fulfilled at the same time
Socialism, not even once.  Edit: to all the left wing extremists and violent apologists;   “In an essay lamenting what he described as the intractable income inequality of the American economy, Senator Sanders declared: “These days, the American dream is more apt to be realized in South America, in places such as Ecuador, Venezuela and Argentina, where incomes are actually more equal today than they are in the land of Horatio Alger”  Despite receiving trillions of dollars in oil revenue over recent decades, Venezuela is in the midst of an unprecedented economic collapse, owing precisely to the redistributionist programs that Sanders has extolled as a model for the U.S. economy. Grocery store shelves are barren, hospitals have no access to vital medicines, rationing is under way, and riots have begun to coalesce in the streets of Caracas.   http://www.libertynewsdaily.com/blog-929-flashback:-bernie-sanders-praised-socialist-venezuela-as-model-for-ending-income-inequality

Luke held a lightsaber for a little while and then could use the force to destroy the Death Star using those proton torpedoes. If he needed training to awaken his full potential, it wasn’t much, like at all.   I’m not trying to convince you to like a movie, I’m telling you that you’re wrong about certain canon elements of the force. It’s not a video game power where there’s a very clear cut progression. Yoda just tells Luke what the force is, then tells him to lift the X-Wing. Luke could have just lifted that thing right off the bat if he had been more confident. It’s an energy field you can tap into, not a muscle you have to work out before you can use it. If you believe and you’re tapped into it, you can use it.

It is always better to have someone to show you, but finding someone who would do that is not that easy. Especially someone who knows his stuff really good.

Mine (Indianapolis, FS Ohio) worked fine last night and now all live programs are blank with an error message on both FS Go app and website. Logout/close out/delete-reinstall, nothing makes a difference.  EDIT: 24 hours later (5/1, 7 pm EDT) and everything seems to be functioning again (at least on my ATV).
If you want to look at my comment history you can see that I'm not defending Lyanna leading the defense against the main gate. (literally look at the comment I posted before this one, I agree with you.) I found it extremely sketchy that you had her in command of a group with a very important task, while Jaime fucking Lannister is literally just shouting whatever Brienne is shouting and being her second in command/serving under her.   &amp;#x200B;  I think it's really fucking stupid. Doesn't mean I didn't find it cool. While I was watching the episode, as soon as I figured out no one was dying when they should be, I don't think anyone is dying at all, I kinda just accepted it was gonna make me mad if I wanted everything to make sense and I decided to make memes of everything. I literally screamed "N-NANI?!?!" at the screen when the Nightking realized Arya made a 200IQ play. The whole episode was stupid. The whole season is gonna be stupid, and the ending is gonna be stupid. I've watched this show for years upon years and was so hyped for this season because I thought it was gonna redeem itself, but no. The show died when Stannis did. It's sad and it sucks but if we keep overthinking every little detail, you're gonna go crazy. Just enjoy it for what it is, a high-budget B-rated anime fanfic.

Let me rephrase, maybe not sad, but emotional. I obviously enjoy some comic relief but the first half of the movie was like a succession of gag like jokes that didn't work for me in this movie. I mean, I loved the battle and I felt the sacrifices and I still get chills thinking about the Avengers Assemble scene, but I think some of the character arcs were a bit wasted.

That’s true, I didn’t read the whole post. Sounds like they have a lot of skills to learn before the serious high points.
Interesting read.  Your analysis of esther (read: criticism of whoever green-lighted her) is I think right on.  How do you release Cid and then a character like this just weeks later?  It must be frustrating to run a ranking system and carefully analyze units for pros and cons to have a disruption like this drop.   Personal question now: Did you pull for Esther or Sophie?
Sometimes it's a way of making your home or life theirs. Think of it like hoarders shoving their crap onto others so that they have auxiliary hoards at their kids' homes.

&gt; You are. You are trying to minimize and obfuscate the very real issue of immigrant violence. You would prefer everyone just not mention it. &gt;  &gt;   No, I'm not. Can you point to a place where I do this? No you can't, because I don't do this and haven't said anything of this kind. Why do you want to lie about this so much? What are you so insecure about? Lying on the internet is so boring. It achieves nothing!!! Why didn't you answer my previous questions? If you did, you'd see that you're shadow boxing and that the thing you're angry about (conspirators denying crime) is actually a fantasy.  And I get that you don't like multiculturalism. Unfortunately, you're just like King Canute. Melbourne is a very multicultural city and this can't be wound back. Probably best either to adapt to this or move somewhere completely different that's ethnically homogeneous. But still, your dislike of multiculturalism doesn't legitimate this conspiracy theory you've created for yourself where you accuse people of holding positions that they don't hold and saying things that they don't say. Lying about this stuff on the internet does nothing other than to make you look incredibly stupid and irrational.

In the conventional sense, sure. That is precisely why citizen armies don't employ conventional tactics. Any impending civil unrest will not be armed citizens going toe to toe with a nation's proffesional army, it will be independent snipers harassing patrols. Small bands of like minded individuals ambushing isolated forces, and knives between ribs in the dark.   Underestimating the resolve of people with nothing left to lose is a mistake.

Yes, you can sell it on your own. But I would only recommend it if you already have a buyer you want to sell to. Depending on the market, I would still personally talk to a couple of agents to get an evaluation on your home so you're not being shorted on the deal. In some markets, putting the home on the market and getting the best price and terms available outweighs the 3-6% you pay for real estate commissions.  If that's not the case for you and you still want to sell it on your own, your escrow company or the buyer's lender might have purchase and sale forms available to you.

He died a Greyjoy and a Stark. I hope Yara gets a lovely raven about how brave Theon was and how he died protecting Bran from the one man who wanted Bran dead.

The same comment applies here that I put to another user here. This is less about the videos themselves, and it goes to the credibility of who gave you the videos.   Mr. Elizondo falsely/erroneously misled DOPSR on the form. If you find his misleading/erroneous/false/inaccurate intentions with that acceptable, and you feel now he is preaching gospel to you and me without erroneous information attached, all for the sake of getting these videos out? That's a horrible way to look at this, and what I refer to as the I WANT TO BELIEVE SYNDROME. He misled the agency on how the videos would be used. In addition, he either misled about the subject, or he didn't, and he knows after thorough analysis, these are highly advanced UAVs aka drones. Either way, it's problematic.   You can not sacrifice the greater picture here, all because you have a few FLIR videos.  The field, the subject and the truth deserves so much more.  If some of you are happy with that? Cool! Its not me to tell you how to think. It's just a shame you aren't looking at the entire point of this article, and this debate: the truth and the honest representation of it is what matters most.

Hypothetical here.   Land prices are dirt cheap due to land taxes  &amp;#x200B;  With the given fact:  Cities are not taxed by provincial or federal level due to their holdings/income  &amp;#x200B;  Is it not in the cities best interest to buy these properties at dirt cheap prices to then re-purpose and do something with, be it lease or turn it into a park. A business can lease these properties for the purpose of revenue generating, or a resident could lease it for personal use. Either way, you have an impermanent ownership structure that looks a lot like China's, or in this case, Hong Kong. which has a housing shortage not due to land shortages (60% of the land is parks basically), but due to city greed. A closer to home comparison, vancouver housing co-ops with their inability to generate financing to live in the houses and UBC native lands being leased and charged 90,000 for water upgrades.

it gives a list of all the skill points location in the game and what ones are completed. so if you have only 1 of the 3 skill points given for the story quests in a zone it only shows the 1/3 so you know to go there and do more quests for the last 2. One of it's most important features is that the window saves you time in seeing which areas don't have all the skyshards left without having to look on the map at each individual zone over and over. I find the greatest time savor to be the compacted list of dungeons, easily the greatest xp/skill point reward for your time can be completing a run you don't have the quest done in yet.

mhmmm honestly YTA. obviously your wife is going to be on your daughters side, but she really shouldn’t be using a vibrator at that age. using her hand or even a shower would be safer. a vibrator, used for long periods of time, could make her lose sensitivity and buildup scar tissue.  now would be a good time for your wife to talk to her about safely exploring her sexuality

The fact is the writer's were the ones to decide Arya should kill the NK, not GRRM.  Was this something GRRM told them to do? Is it where GRRM plans on taking the story? We don't know but but based on Inside the Episode it seems like the writer's decided it should be Arya because 'it was surprising and hopefully people wouldn't see it coming.'  In order to help this work they retconned the Mel quote and built two seasons alluding to Arya being the one to kill NK.  People are angry because 1. It ruins a lot of character arcs and plot lines and 2. it was totally anticlimactic and imo looked ridiculous.

I don't 100% see the point. I think one of the problems with the main sub is people constantly post 'criticism' as if it's a dm to the Grumps. The likelihood of the grumps seeing it is slim to none. Even if they do see it I doubt anything listed here would be anything that hasn't been said 100 times before.  In the end any criticism written here wouldn't be giving GG polite criticism but really just be us complaining to each other about the grumps. I honestly think there is enough of that in the main sub. It would be nice to just have a place to laugh about the good things.  Edit: I don't mean to say we shouldn't discuss the on goings of GG but I think it should be seen as that, 'discussing whats going on with GG amongst each other' not 'giving GG polite criticism'.

I grew up in a non denominational offshoot of the Plymouth Brethren. I think I was about 16 when I started seeing things I wasn't okay with. I couldn't handle the way outsiders were treated. People on the inside were incredibly condescending and hateful to anyone who were slightly different to them. Even when the person was another member. Not one person ever practiced what they preached and women were treated as second class citizens. And I'm gay so none of it was going to go down well. I left at 26. As a woman it took a while to get into a stable career. All of my immediate and most of the extended family is still in. I've been disowned and they basically pretend I'm dead. Every now and then I get letters telling me to repent.  I don't regret it. Not even a little bit.

&gt;While these covert operations had mixed results, one effort in 1954 and 1955, a propaganda campaign known as Operation Exodus, ultimately convinced 1.25 million North Vietnamese Catholics to emigrate to the south."  the claim is absurd on its face.  not a single refugee came for a reason other than it was convinced by the CIA?  No one would actually claim that, it's literally just bad writing you're taking at face value.  ultimately 1.25 million people went south, and the CIA has no idea how many they convinced, and they admit that their record in the north was, at best, mixed.   &gt;The Catholics were called by their priests with the belief that "God has gone south", an official slogan of CIA campaign.  Once again, you denigrate Catholics, ignore non-Catholics, and ignore the post 1975 exodus.  Did you bother reading what I wrote?

The right to bear arms should not be infringed. It's a mental health issue. A cultural issue. Taking guns away only empowers the state. The state should work for it's citizenry, not the other way around. It's a matter of principle.  What's the point of banning assault rifles when criminals can get them through the black market?  Again, the focus should be more systems of support for individuals at the local and community level.  Switzerland allows assault rifles and they don't have these mass shooting issues.

Uh...? I’m so sorry if this is rude or inconsiderate, but how does that change anything? Two Phone Addicts is already covering/patrolling that area.(Pippi and Ryuto.) and if you kill one of them in witness view of the other one, then you’ll have a heroic after you, and if you do defeat them, you’ll need to clean up both bodies. It is already difficult. In my opinion, this makes murder harder, since now they’ll be more witnesses on the roof. I get the roof very far away, though. So I understand where you’re coming from. Again, sorry if this is rude or inconsiderate.

Gender and sexuality are two separate, unrelated things.   Sexuality is who you go to bed with.  Gender in who you go to bed as.  For instance, I am a queer trans woman. Queer is describing who I sleep with and date. Trans woman is who I am.  EDIT:  There are also terms to add on to genders:  • Cisgender - someone who's gender aligns with their assigned gender at birth. Example: a cisgender man is someone who, when born, was assigned a male.  • Transgender - someone who's gender does not align with their assigned gender at birth. Example: Me! When I was born, the doctors said I was a boy. When I turned 17, I told them they were wrong. Now I'm a girl.

I wish I was in your situation at 26. You’re doing awesome! I would pay off the vehicle if the company is going to keep paying your reimbursement. Get a small loan to help your credit. If you qualify, talk to the bank about a cash secured loan. I did this recently, they took $5000 out of my savings account, put it into a CD earning 2.8%, and my $5000 loan is on 4.8% as a result. This was a considerably better rate than an unsecured loan. This obviously isn’t ideal for everyone, and if you want to be 100% debt free then obviously this isn’t something you’d want to do, but if you’re worried about keeping your credit score up then I’d look into it.

^ this, and Chieftain is a great source for tank facts.  The idea of the Sherman catching fire and exploding only came from the first hundred or so initial models sent to Africa.  Once crewmen realized the volatility of the ammo storage, within 3 months the entire US Sherman stockpile had been outfitted with cryogenic storage bays lined with antifreeze and coolant systems that reduced cook-off detonations by 80% and prevented engine fires almost entirely. It was the most advanced, effective, and secure ammo-storage compartment of any AFV design used in the war until the M26 arrived; hell, the Wehraboo’s mighty Tiger II literally stacked 88mm rounds horizontally in their outermost armor bulkhead, and had a tendency of vaporizing itself even when knocked in the side by an 85mm HE found, a large reason why so few were recovered intact.

If the only evidence for the supernatural is that people claim to have experienced it that still requires a certain level of faith to believe in it that I don’t want to give. Often times, these miracles can be explained by good doctors or something else. Sometimes the “witness” has mental issues, and sometimes they’re flat out lying. If some are completely true I would have no idea, because I cannot speak to them. Human accounts of events otherwise known to be impossible are not sufficient. There is no way to prove they’re true, so the issue of evidence is still there.

Admittedly, I spend a lot of time playing with Nolimits 2 and I believe Planet Coaster has pretty high friction compared to that simulator... On the other hand, there's a pretty accurate [Planet Coaster re-creation of Steel Vengance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDEEslckSD0) where they had to lower the friction to 0.9 in order to match the real-world coaster. Hard to say if the re-creation is the exact same size as the real ride, but it looks pretty close in the video.

How likely is that do you think?
I don’t understand people telling him to calm down or that’s he’s wrong. That seems ridiculous to me, if he’s enjoying this game more than the last of us than so be it, that’s his opinion. People seem to have this notion that because the last of us was received better that it means everyone will think it’s better. Personally I enjoy both games, the last of us is better in my opinion, however it’s certainly not beyond criticism as some are making out. Calling him a shill and other nonsense is ironic because you’re the ones shilling for the last of us by telling him he’s not allowed to think this game is better. Everything is entirely subjective and I get so tired of seeing people attempting to become the arbiters of other people’s tastes

It would be better to block the sunlight from the tank since even if you remove the silicates, other algae would likely grow since you have such a big diatom issue. Diatoms feed on both silicates and light, so too much light in the form of either too long or too bright is also a major cause.

What if that's just her natural personality with everyone? There wouldn't be much to assume as flirting if that's the case. And while yes, some girls want to date someone who looks good, there are a lot more guys who would want to date girls who look good.   There are a lot more people who would prefer bad looks but great and caring personality over someone who has good looks but awful and abusive personality. While I'm not saying that every good looking person has a bad personality or vise versa, but what I am saying is that if someone was given a choice between the two, the first one would be a popular pick. I know this is said a lot but it's true: if somebody doesn't like you because of your looks, give up on them since they're obviously not good enough for you.

Its possible. What I was originally arguing still stands, would it have been enough to defeat Thanos? They would be down Iron man during the whole fight. Just saying...in the main timeline the only reason Tony was able to get the stones was basically though slight of hand. Even then, that was when Iron man was there the entire fight.

I was hesitant to post because I don’t have anxiety and I don’t have a ton of experience with it. The whole time I was listening I felt like all of that was kind of normal stuff. When we first brought my son home from the hospital I was terrified to drive with him because I was scared of someone hitting me but I know that those feelings are pretty normal for any new parent. I might have to take a break from all of these insta-idiots.
Real answer: Busy AF and therefore tunnel vision. Tends to happen when you run a super secret spy agency I imagine.
Warframe's chat client is actually an embedded IRC client. So there's nothing stopping you from hacking into the chat channels with a different IRC client, and then logging from that.
I don’t agree with the way the announcer said it, but it does make sense to me why they would discourage people that aren’t officially sign up for the race (especially small children) from being on the course if only for insurance and liability purposes.

Planning on doing the same. Hopefully they do add her to the pool after maintenance.
Same for us lol.
Agree completely. Nothing is perfect and I eve have some small gripes, although not many, with the episode, but I thought it was some of the best "tv" I've ever watched. And every actor did an amazing job and all their performances contributed so well to the tension and episode in general. I trust the actors for sure in that regard as well and trust the writers who have been thinking and planning all this for so long with Martin himself way more than the arm chair critics. I just hope the cast and crew don't focus too much on all the hate. Loved the episode, excited for the final, and thankful for the entertaining work they've all done.

Now, I know what you're thinking. "This loser just used PhotoShop to make the number really big, or maybe he copied and pasted a bunch of empty text files." Well I'm here today to tell you that that's not the case.   I saved three Kasumi photos in a folder, then wrote an entire program to close all three images in that folder a total of 2112 times. So, yes, I technically have a folder on my computer that has 6342 pictures of Kasumi, even if there are only three distinct ones.  It's low effort, but it's not *that* low effort.

Fighting for aggro is stupid, that's no brainer and others have said that already.  Having someone contest my top aggro used to annoy me too, but not anymore. In 8-man content I just shirk the other tank, because why not? All I care is that the guy who is so BURNING to be main tank is doing at least half decent job - and if he won't he will be dead and I'll be the new tank by default. People who voke asap after being raised amuse and annoy me still, because wth is the reason behind wanting to be MT with near death weakness?   In 24-man content there is usually something not-necessarily-interesting-but-helpful-to-literally-everyone-else things to in in form of trash. Especially if two out of three tanks are super insistent on being the top dog, trash coming from the flanks gets often ignored by tanks who wanna be the center of attention. What annoys me in 24-man content is people who do not know their alphabets, generally; if one tanks wants to be THE tank in alliance, whatever party they belong to, they always seem to think it is B.

Nardwuar knows literally EVERYTHING about the person/people he interviews. That’s why his gimmick works. That and he’s the first to do that so he’s original and people like that. But who makes Nardwuar a legend is that you see him and think “oh this guys a joke” but then he spews off insane facts about people that no one else seems to know.

When it was my first experience and I was naive? I wasn't even sure they were "red flags". It took me about 3 weeks to notice that things felt off, and I thought it was just me. I've since learned that anxiety = bad sign. Any weird feeling = pay attention.  I can now spot red flags on the first or second date. Sometimes even before meeting the person, if it's via a dating app. For ex, someone who's bad at scheduling, bad at texting, especially when you're supposed to be going on a date, is someone you should avoid.  I'm a very analytical person though. I notice things other people take a while longer to figure out. I've even had guys call me out on being this perceptive. I can figure out what makes a guy tick in less than 2 hours.

Wrong. Young footballers to this day help around in the changing rooms. Not just around the changing rooms either, they are given multiple other jobs in many departments. They're also told to study in the event their career goes wayward.  Also, it speaks volumes when that is your example. Young footballers bursting through are deemed to be the most arrogant, selfish bunch to date... I'd say Lio Rush is of the same mould.

As a straight guy I just assumed gay people didn't enjoy butt stuff BECAUSE they were gay so I tried out some stuff. To involve sexuality there at all is kind of weird.

Fear of mentioning that because people might label you gay only works if you care about people thinking you're gay. I don't.

It's the worst when this thread falls on a Tuesday. I just reviewed a quarter of the books I read this month this morning. Books I finished in April:  * **Abbott** by Saladin Ahmed &amp; Sami Kivelä - An urban fantasy graphic novel set in Detroit in the early 1970s following a black female investigative reporter as she unravels a supernatural mystery. Great story and superb art. Used on the Graphic Novel bingo square (hard mode).  * **Who Fears Death** by Nnedi Okorafor - A post-apocalyptic story set in a future African-styled land following a young woman who is the product of rape who has magical abilities. A confronting and unforgettable story. Used on the Afrofuturism bingo square.  * **Black Leopard, Red Wolf** by Marlon James - An African themed fantasy following a man called Tracker as he travels the land on various jobs. Brutal and unflinching from difficult content. The first half is pretty slow but the second has great momentum. I highly recommend the audiobook. Used on the #Ownvoices bingo square (hard mode).  * **The Magician King** by Lev Grossman - The second book in the Magicians series. This great follow up to the first book is a riff on The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with the usual Magicians broken characters looking for happiness in the wrong places. Used on the Ocean Setting bingo square.  * **Babylon's Ashes** by James S.A. Corey - The sixth book in The Expanse series was scattershot and hard to get into for me for the first two thirds, but ramped up to a very satisfying ending. This book does not fit a single 2019 bingo square.  * **Days of Infamy** by Harry Turtledove - An alt history that asks what would have happened if Japan had invaded Hawaii after attacking Pearl Harbor. An interesting thought piece with workmanlike prose. I'm not sure if I'll read the next book in the duology. I don't think I consider it SFF enough for me to use for bingo.  * **The Dragon Book: Magical Tales from the Masters of Modern Fantasy** edited by Gardner Dozios &amp; Jack Dann - A high-quality anthology of stories about Dragons. I used five stories from this for bingo, but didn't use it for hard mode because it would have blocked out too many authors, including two potential Australians.   * **Age of Assassins** by R.J. Barker - An assassin's apprentice with a clubfoot and his master are dragooned by a queen into hunting assassins trying to kill her son. Great main characters hooked me, and the world was interesting, but the bad guys were just too damn arch. I might read the next book anyway. Used on the Disability bingo square (hard mode).  * **The High King** by Lloyd Alexander - The last book in The Chronicles of Prydain ties everything up nicely with a fully matured Taran. A charming series. Read it to a kid or read it yourself for fun. Used on the Final Book in a Series bingo square. My plan for bingo this year is just to fill squares disregarding hard mode, and then maybe replace the ones that aren't hard mode later. There are a couple of hard mode squares that I think I might not be interested in perusing, though.  **[HERE IS MY CURRENT BINGO CARD!](https://i.imgur.com/dSTJlnA.png)**

besides the typical keeping ecosystems in balance, they are native pollinators when they mature! monarchs and bees are the two big wigs of pollination (as in two of the most famous creatures to do so)
I didn't know that Nebula was an aspiring musician
“Ever think what a coincidence it is that Lou Gehrig died of Lou Gehrig’s disease?”
Hold on is the Norton Hulk movie a part of the MCU? I don’t follow it very closely but I always assumed it was pre-MCU
I have heard that it is more toxic than Chernobyl
Ah cara, vai catar coquinho. Larga mão de ser preconceituoso e vai pra vida real.
Once you do the step back animation. Don’t shoot. Let the opponent lose balance and it should either one of those animations
i disagree. he's been so aloof and, for lack of a better description, *weird* since returning to Winterfell. If they can show him having manipulated the others into fighting the living as is theorized by OP, including having manipulated things to bring him to power, i think they can set him up just fine.  To complete the heel turn he'd have to kill Dany and/or his siblings to reveal his true nature.  I can't quite connect all the dots, but i do think there has to be some last swerve of this caliber to justify having the night king threat end so early. i figure most likely it's something like this, or at the least, it would involve dany nuking KL and forcing Jon to bring her to justice or something. I don't like that idea necessarily either, so Bran being the final boss would be both surprising but also not completely illogical.  I've spent a ton of time this season and the end of the last season internally screaming "WHY ISNT BRAN TELLING EVERYONE EVERytHING?!" and chalked it up to shit writing that wanted to maintain suspense.   this would at least provide an explanation for that, ha.
But who will be the one for next month?
Thanks for your great reply, Michael!
Okay, time to get Elon back on 60 Minutes and Joe Rogan.
Sure. Steelers and Chargers. Chargers success as of late has really been more about their defense than their offense. Their offense is top 15, but it isn't top 10. The Steelers just lost one of their star wrs, they have a qb who is aging and has a habit of throwing his wrs under the bus, and they just lost their top ranked o line coach who was the main reason their run game worked so well.
You got paddack too?
I mean for starters you have to pay for the electricity...
I haven’t filled the empties yet, but every standard one is filled up, yet they have slight differences still ? Like Wakka has more accuracy even though they have the same spheres filled
Ughhhh so true. Thanks for your support boo
Wasps are terrifying but they're an extremely important part of the ecosystem. They'll kill bugs, caterpillars, spiders, etc. Keeps pests under control, helps farmers, make figs...   Just...keep a respectful, careful distance, ha.
tbf my interact is mwdown
Aha!  Your two seasons are:  1) Patio season.  2) Longing for patio season.  &amp;#x200B;  Right.  Those have always been the two seasons.
Let me know when you have an argument
No, it isn’t. Epic themselves have stated that the introduction of siphon lowered the quality of the game for 90% of the playerbase. That’s the closest we have to hard numbers. Not some streamer asking his fans to echo his own opinion.
I don’t know you, but I’m glad you are alive with us.
Lmao Envy has so much hate going on, if anything he’d get hordes of vindicated Envy haters starting a circlejerk.
I like how you’ve got snow piling on them
EFI Logics in Bethel, CT. They specialize in subaru’s and do everything from full race car builds to simple maintenance as well tuning.
I just saw this. Thought the exact same thing. Thoughts and prayers.....
to be fair... we start with $100.  He made three trades last week to acquire FAAB to be the guy with the most.  It wasn't like he bid the "wrong" amount, he apparently didn't even submit a bid (he says he did, which is the issue).  But every single person in the league expected a $152 bid from him.
Yep. In arguably Veep's most horrendous season. But yeah, I hear you. I'd take a bad season of Veep over a good one of most other shows.
