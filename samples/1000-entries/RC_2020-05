Theology can be a contentious topic.  How much and what anyone can accept depends on where they are at.  Reality is not understandable from within the ego framework because we made the ego so as not to understand it.  * C-in.4. **The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give.** It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, ‚ÄúHow did the impossible occur?", ‚ÄúTo what did the impossible happen?", and may ask this in many forms. Yet **there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you.**  My suggestion is that you turn this matter over to the Holy Spirit and let Him decide for you instead.
You know, it‚Äôs weird you say this, because I had this thought (which I don‚Äôt really believe) that there‚Äôs a chance that he‚Äôs just saying this with the secret agenda to motivate people to educate themselves... like he realizes that whether this is true or not, people will strive to better educate themselves, so it‚Äôs a win/win
I'm reading so many threads in how the students who are taking the exam must wear masks throughout the 8 hrs which is insane with all the anxiety and stress and I have asthma so I don't know if I should and just take the exam at a later date
no. what im saying is we arent saving anyone. there is no treatment. wed have to complely isolate. that means no going out for food. no deliveries nothing for a month. that would kill more people than the virus.

My wife totaled the front end of our car one year: radiator and bumper gone. I thought we would lose the car. USAA took our claim, paid out $6k plus for the repairs, and my car was fixed.

So it took me a while to look at everyone I loved and I came up to the little wood cabin that belongs to little molly. I walked in and she was sitting on her chair next to the little white plush rug, reading a book with a melting warm candle glowing next to her. I think Beau could be her buddy that walks together with her in the morning, down from the mountaintop to the hot springs while molly tells him all about her storybook as the sun just rises over the mountaintop. Beau is the guy who comes over during the harsh rainstorming nights to lay on the rug next to the fire while molly sweeps the table to get ready for dinner while thunder crashes outside. There isn't much said through words on these nights. However, being together on nights such as these transforms the thunder into nothing but a lulling, distant drum.  I think molly and beau will be the next two who pick up a mic together and anxiously try to sing along to rockstar or wandering. When beau stumbles over the  words he does not know yet, Molly will clap for him and let him know it's okay. If molly starts to feel down and starts to doubt herself, I know beau will come in and let her know no matter what, she can prevail and "Go Beyond!".  I think together, they can unlock pure curiosity,  adventure and the excitement of island life while they explore together. They'll be the best of neighbors and the best buddies for life.

Yes, we were tourists in a touristic area and we were speaking Spanish with an obvious Latin American accent which the waitress obviously heard when she approached the table. I mean, I am not going to say that I'm absolutely sure she knew we were tourists but of course she did. I don't know if it was racism, I highly doubt it as I've never encountered *this* type of racism in Spain but it would make the situation even more surreal tbh.  And this was the first and only time I've had this type of situation but for a friend of mine who was with me that day, it was not. So yes, it does happen, there are assholes everywhere.

Great perspective! I love this, and the shadow is awesome!
Your clit is begging to be sucked.
Communion with believers is \*always\* in the context of our union with Christ. It cannot be separated, particularly when we use the word Communion as a name for the Lord's Supper‚Äîit is first and foremost a description of our sharing in Christ through the sacrament, not in our physically sharing the same space (And hence, why I don't think this strain of argument has a place in the virtual sacraments conversation).  There IS a sense in which all believers commune together in taking the sacraments. The WCF (29.1) explicates on the link:   &gt;...the Lord's Supper, to be observed... for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of himself in his death; the sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him; and, **to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other, as members of his mystical body.**  Respectfully, it is *precisely* when talking about the sacraments that it is necessary to use the word "communion" to refer to our union with Christ and his body, the Church. That's the whole point of the word.

...and? Assassination refers to stealthily killing a target, as demonstrated and proven literally by the Assassin's Creed games. Again, your analogy was pointless. Sure, words have multiple meanings. But when a word has been demonstrated to have one specific meaning time and time again (for 13 years now), trying to force your own definition onto is kind of silly.

And are we supposed to believe Peter did not know Fitch created it? Who did Peter think created it? Because Peter was never seen targeting Fitch for his role in the device. Fitch was chasing after an item that his own superior had created. Get a hold of that logic? Forget about any persons later on who got possession of it. Why not also go for the person who created it which was really self sabotage?

2 people in the last twenty years have died. Given that something like 20-40 service members die in aircraft related accidents every year, that's actually not a bad record.

If the CODE for a group of colonial synthocells are collected into a single gamete, so that the entire colonial organism can replicate itself as a single unit, then at some point a random mutation can allow for multiple gametes to fuse and recombine. This is basically how sexual reproduction evolved on real life. I would imagine that is what would need to happen to evolve sexual reproduction in these sythometal organisms as well.

I understand/respect your concerns.  I think there is a lot to be said for allowing people to cautiously and respectfully "recreate"- months indoors can wreck certain folks mentally and emotionally. It's worth caring for their wellbeing, even if one can't relate. That sort of suffering is an ongoing reality, not a low odds potential they can evade by their own distancing and practices.   And hell, if the carfulls of kids I see hopping in and out of eachothers vehicles, smoking weed together at the marsh haven't caused an uptick, some people strolling on the beach in the supposedly virus-killing sun probably won't either.

Epsilon is supposed to be a really small number, not 0, so we arent going to set it equal to 0. If we directly set it equal to 0 we can no longer do a lot of the analysis that we want to do in order to get proper answers. Limits for example wont make sense because we first assume that |x-a|&lt;delta and |f(x)-L|&lt;epsilon. If epsilon is 0 then we now have the absolute value of something being less than 0 which is impossible

Ask r/ProIran for their opinion next time. Both r/Iran and r/Iranian censor pro-IR content and users and are subject to the whims of two people with a penchant for censorship and silencing people.  The headmods of both rIran and rIranian (rIran 2.0.) also share the same ideology. People had an exodus from r/Iran to r/Iranian when beloved mod rezsahin was banned. But then rezsahin got banned from r/Iranian as well because the headmod got into an argument with him over headmod's massive support for Russia, and 1am another beloved mod got banned recently as well along with a whole slew of the most active users.   And they are now banning anyone who even mentions these events to the community. But the truth can't be silenced forever.  Both headmods routinely sticky talking points from Israelis and regime changers and deny the alternative (1Am was the last bastion remaining, and now they are both controlled by regime change opposition).  So there is now an exodus to r/ProIran, which has measures in place to ensure something like the other events never happens again.

&gt;No I wasn't referring to that, just the statement about YouTube videos.  Do you honestly believe that 70% of all the content on YouTube is true and should be taken at face value? That seems incredibly gullible to me.  &gt;I would bet that there are people that can answer your question with a resounding YES! With verifiable sources if any of them had the balls to step up and talk publicly to prove it to you.   You shouldn't assume that your vague hunch is correct by conjuring up some hypothetical person out there who totally has all the evidence but won't share it. Just because silencing exists as a concept doesn't mean Satanic cults are a real thing.

In "ye olden days" it was actually used as much for age as for marital status. Mature unmarried women were called "Mrs" as a respectful honorific.   Obviously it was also a marital status marker, especially for young women who went from being unmarried to married.  19th century literature is full of older female characters who never married and all go by Mrs Name.

If you want more time periods and regions youll have to deal with the consequences, one of those being changes to how the assasins operates. And considering what culture we're hoping into this time being fucking norse, the most testosterone fueled maniacs in history, its safe to say there will be some changes. I think odyssey and origins kept the spirit of the games rather well while making sure to add new region and time period related spice, and the attitudes of the characters you play.

Yeah. Length measurements have the unfortunate problem of being split. Things measured in your hand are base 2 (cubit, bolt) things you measure on the ground are base 12 (feet, inches, a mile is right around 12\*12\*12 yards) and things you measure on the ocean are base 10 (100 fathoms is a cable, 10 cables is a nautical mile)  Then you have thousands of years bickering on what the "best" number base is and people coming up with all kinds of strange conversions to try and round off measures in other bases into their own idealized number base.

Basically (as i understand it) dolores used the data from delos to download williams mind onto the last pearl when at the forge and put it into a printed host body of caleb.  caleb/william woudnt go "daddy delos" crazy because his "caleb" personality would mask the reality.  pro's for this theory:  mib william is listed officially as dead, and he and caleb have the same user number.  con's would be that the emp wouldve shut him down - or we're back on two f-ing timelines again.  my head hurts

Got this from an interview in reference to the mythology:   Darby - "The way we approach Norse mythology in Valhalla--we wanted to take a grounded approach, but we wanted to portray this culture as people who legitimately believed in these things. This mythology, this religion--it's infused in every aspect of their life. They bargained and bartered with the gods before raids, before feasts, before harvests. We wanted to portray that in as grounded a way as possible.  For somebody like Eivor--who in the midst of battle would believe these things about these gods--we felt they'd believe they could see Odin. We wanted to start from there, to keep the player swimming in that feeling. I'm not going to go too much further than that, but this is the same team that made Origins and our feeling about how to integrate [mythology] is similar. We want to create a similar feeling of being suffused in the mythology, but also the daily practice of this religion. Especially since you're going to be in England, which is a Christian nation. There were a lot of interesting frictions, but also some attempts at understanding one another."  I, for one, could not be happier. Odyssey took things a little too far with the mythology imo. Origins had just the right balance.

I made several references to Josef Goebbels if im not mistaken... Etc etc  If you are gonna say shit against the status quo, expect to be resisted, mocked and the recipient of condescending rhetoric... If you weren't.... you must not have been saying shit against the status quo.

Thank you!  Glad you enjoyed them!So I have been collecting doll parts from primarily Amazon, Etsy and Ebay.  Amazon: best place to get furniture sets.  Just type in 1/12 and furniture, and you can find whole kitchen sets, living room sets, for something like 24 bucks.  I usually just use Amazon first, cuz they are the most cost effective solution.  Ebay: Ebay has a wider selection than Amazon; if you really need this specific prop, go here. Just type in 1/12 and whatever you are looking for: 1/12 and telephone, for example.  Etsy: So only if Ebay and Amazon don't have what I want, do I go to Etsy.  Etsy usually has the higher prices, because, understandably, a lot of their stuff is not mass produced, but hand-made by individuals.  But there are surprisingly good deals sometimes.  Special shout out to Retroldtech at Etsy, he makes very reasonable priced video game consoles (literally all of them), and can make whatever scale you want (1/6, 1/12, etc.)  Also, he is willing to customize, such as make specific screens for your switch.  Stores like ShoptOfMiraclesArt at Etsy has just about everything you can think of:  like an 8 piece set of pencils and clipboard, for 6.73 dollars, just scroll through their store.  I have a doll-house, which is basically 3 green walls and a floor, that I got from Etsy; I can't find my specific one anymore on the site, but I think you can just use three boards and a floor/paint them for similar effect.  However, djs\_dioramas at instagram makes diorama sets (3 wall/floor set), for very reasonable prices, and can customize them to colors/wall styling that you want.  I also installed windows/doors on some of my diorama sets.  So the diorama I got from dkasten004 was made of foam boards, so I just used a box cutter to open up holes in the diorama to install them.  Very messy/ugly holes, sure there is a better way to do it, but I don't really know what I am doing.  You can get 1/12 windows and doors just by typing "1/12" and "window" at Amazon, Ebay, etc.  On some of the series part, I use a storefront; I basically just bought a storefront facade and plopped it in front of the dollhouse, to make a "store" appearance.   I like it a lot because it has already installed plastic/"glass" windows out of the box, and has a functioning door. Here is the listing for the storefront  [https://www.etsy.com/listing/775635134/112-scale-dolls-house-shop-front?ref=yr\_purchases](https://www.etsy.com/listing/775635134/112-scale-dolls-house-shop-front?ref=yr_purchases)  Feel free to ask more questions, it is fun for me !Thanks again!

20 seconds... that's how long they had to think about how fucking stupid they are.  Edit: A falling human reaches terminal velocity in about 12 seconds, after which his speed will remain constant. She'll fall about 450 meters in those first 12 seconds, and about 58 meters each second after that. There are 1609 meters in a mile. The fall would take just under 20 seconds.

I've kind of noticed the same thing with my wife and she's a 36D.  The other day she said something to be the effect of some girl on the TV "with her huge boobs" is skanky. The was nothing at all particularly skanky about this girl / actress / whatever.  I just looked at her and said, "baby, you have big boobs too".  She got all huffy and said with a generous helping of side-eye "*not as big as hers*" . I had no idea where this came from, but as I thought more about it, I can think of other times she's said things like that over the years. It's not like she's fat or ugly or ever had trouble attracting men either. She's still hot and thin by any measure and when she was younger she was an absolute smokeshow. The way women view each other is fucked.

One night, I was sitting on the couch, watching my favorite TV show, when I heard a voice say, "Come here my child, follow my voice." I did what the voice wanted and followed it into the kitchen. I was surprised to see a giant can of Chef Boyardee sitting in the middle of my kitchen. I stood there in amazement wondering what would happen next. Then he broke the silence and asked, "Why haven't you been your Chef Boyardee my child. I said I didn't like Chef Boyardee anymore. He said I was lying and asked me to climb inside of him. I said no. Then, he pulled out a gun and said, "Get inside of me or I will kill you." I said ok and climbed inside of him. The Chef Boyardee was like quicksand, the more you struggle, the quicker you sink. After a while, the Chef Boyardee consumed me and I fell into a Chef Boyardee void. I fell for what seemed like hours, and then a white light consumed me, and I woke up laying on the floor in the kitchen. I was reborn. I was a new man. I stood up and said, "Thank you chef." He smiled, and floated into the floor. Ever since that night I have been eating Chef Boyardee for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My friends don't like me anymore, because all I talk about is Chef Boyardee. But that didn't matter. I don't need them because I will always have my Chef Boyardee.

Here‚Äôs a good in-depth backstory on how the Raps got him: https://torontosun.com/sports/basketball/raptors-determination-to-sign-davis-a-tale-worth-telling  It wasn‚Äôt Masai. It was Dan Tolzman (our Director of Scouting) and the rest of our Scouting department that ‚Äúfound‚Äù TDII. They went to watch him play specifically in his Summer League debut and instantly wanted to sign him. They especially had their eyes on him since the Draft Combine.

I'm kind of glad that we get an extra long offseason. With a young team and new coaching, they'll have plenty of time to learn the playbook and get it memorized before they get into the building. Time to get strong mentally, emotionally, and physically before a tough season where we face a lot of good teams and we'll be tested from game one.
YTA. And you're an idiot.  &gt;I used 4 or 5 drops not realising it's a 1 drop starting strength.  Why would you not read the label before you start taking it? That's like taking someone's sleeve of pills and popping half a pack, you just wouldn't. Or maybe you would because you don't understand boundaries.  &gt;I decided to use a few drops a day as it really improved my mood.  Your phrased this wrong. What you meant to say is you had the AUDACITY to steal PAIN medication from your girlfriend because it gets you high and raises your mood. You know what ruins your girlfriend's mood? Constant pain.  I'm honestly baffled at how selfish a person can be.
Please, no one make a smug dancing compilation wearing this.

So you mean this opinion was posted here before?
I'd say Final Fantasy 4 and bloodborne stand out to me right now.  Ff4's intro really sold it to me so I stuck with it for a good while, even though I'm not a fan of turn based combat. I've been tempted to get ff15 as it also isn't turn based and I enjoy the idea of the narrative progression it's going for, but I'll have to see.  Bloodborne is what I wish souls wanes were more like. Its just a bit more straightforward and quicker. I like the idea of being challenged, but clunky slowness combined with punishing difficulty isn't entertaining for me. Bloodborne's speed makes up for the punishing style of gameplay. Also the areas are more interrsting and straightforward, evoking a deeper interest and reaction from me that souls games do. I've yet to try sekiro but that too seems to fit what I want from a soulslike game but leaving behind what I don't like.
Aw yes please
Aside from what the other said below, it's also because they size of the goal is not adjusted from the men's size, unlike say basket height for women's basketball. It's nearly impossible for anyone but a freakishly tall woman goalie to grab shots perfectly placed at the extremities of the goal. Especially for players from countries in Asia and latin america.
Awesome. Thank you very much! Feel free to ask a question any time. I like chatting it up with folks! Makes it more fun if we engage together!
I assume since it was at one of The Opening Regionals, is that 40 laser timed? Cause if so, this kid has WHEELS. 4.39 as a junior in high school is insane.
Just happened to come across it and ended up watching the last 8 holes.  It was awesome.  The tips were great.  His swing is obviously great.  Seeing his rhythm and balance improve as the round progress was cool.  And it was awesome seeing the competitive juices come through as he got down in the match.  He always looks so calm and cool on tv, but it was neat to see how calmly fired up he was over a 9-hole $5 match that we all know and love, hyping himself to hit a good shot, along with the passive aggressive shit talking to his opponent.  It's also cool to see that some of his thoughts and reactions during the round are no different than any of ours.   Great stuff in these desperate times.  10/10
I will try anything !! Thank you !!

Not cleaning it isn‚Äôt going to cause it to break, but it will cause everything to wear out faster (rear cog, chainring, and chain). Replacing a chain is cheap compared to replacing the others. As for lube, any bicycle specific chain lube will be fine. Everyone has their favorite, but are any of them really ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than another? Probably not.

I used to have that problem too, but tilting the right side of my keyboard somewhere between 15-30 degrees away from me rather than parallel has made it a bit easier. The only custom bind I have though is a keyboard macro that literally just spams 'e' every 21ms so I can open and close doors at mach-10, and it's the funniest shit to hear. No real advantage as everyone within a mile radius will hear it and squeaky doors are limited, but nuke is one hell of a fun time
If they do it like black flag it will be good. The assassin story took a back seat to Edward n' Friends swashbuckling pirate adventures. The modern day segment of that game was also by far the best.

I never really understood this. Some people are hurt by the gossip and want to clear things up. I've heard a lot of gossip and can't understand some of those who run with it without considering there is always another side. I think its how you address it that is going to determine what people will believe is true or not.  If someone accused you of something and word got back to you, if you confronted them calmly and logically in front of those same people, that is planting a seed against the gossiper.

There are certainly UUs who self identify as Christians, and even UU churches that are explicitly Christian, though in a form that most of Christianity would consider heretical. Most of us don‚Äôt think of ourselves as Christians, though. A lot of us non-Christian UUs are nevertheless extremely influenced by Christian roots. Others are UU while also being practicing pagans or Buddhists or a lot of other things. Some of us are theists and some of us are atheists. UU is a really really big tent.

You use bob to create a cross fire, split the team, or pressure point.  Essentially you wait for one Ana's sleep dart to come out and then throw him where he can't be ignored. Usually into a corner across from you is a good general rule. He's not really a team wipe kind of ult, but you can use him to force tanks to shield for their team, force a team off Hanamura high-ground to contest point, Volskaya B point is Bob city because the entire point is a cube surrounded by high-ground, etc.   You usually want Bob to go in right as teams meet. You want to force the decision between addressing Bob and addressing your team to be as difficult as possible so teams more likely make the wrong decision.
FileZilla can't move files between destination (xbox) folders.  It uploads files from the PC to the destination folder or downloads from the Xbox to the PC.  Use the File Manager of the replacement dashboard to do that.  Edit: The file manager/explorer has two panes.  Files on the currently highlighted pane are considered the source and the folder path set on the other pane is the destination location.  Use the D-pad Left and Right buttons to switch between panes.   I believe you press Start to bring up the command menu then you select copy or move to process the selected files.  Edit 2: D-pad left and right, not triggers to switch current selection pane.  The left and right triggers move quickly up and down the file listing while the D-pad up and down moves one entry at a time.
Well then Happy birthday Noble among Nobles.

Same hat! I hope that meme isn't dated by now. I absolutely have started on hrt, just got on it recently from Planned Parenthood in my area and they were very helpful. I'm starting at a low dose (.25ml of a  20mg concentrate). I'm planning to transition just as far as I like, mainly to get to that point. I've already got a sports bra and binder picked out, and can't wait to honestly look more middle of the road than anything. I'd suggest Planned Parenthood if that works for you, and a PCP if that's not an option. The cost of HRT wasn't very high either, even without insurance, though that was through Planned Parenthood ($50 USD all in all).  I'm also on some T blockers and have had a noticeable effect already. It hasn't made me any more fem, but I don't have to shave as much and that's already a bonus

&gt; It's obvious that the Wordpress author is implying that she changed her story from a story "not about sexual misconduct" to a story that includes sexual misconduct.  There's no implication. It's literally the difference between those two sentences.  &gt; But again, my point was to highlight that this anonymous Wordpress author is just afraid to go mask off   Whatever your issues with how the author presented himself, it's a different matter entirely from what's actually presented in this post about Tara's actions.
Expecting certain behaviours because of a persons sex is just BS stereotypes that are harmful to everyone. A feminine boy who wants to wear dresses is still a boy.

I think, if anything, this thread has shown that people revere Azula as an unbeatable Dark Souls boss without weaknesses or mortal needs, and Korra's entire childhood just didn't happen.
Exactly. The whole premise of the game is intertwined with the series main overarching villain: The Enclave. They are responsible (and partially responsible) for everything from the FEV, the vaults and their experiments, to the war itself. Taking place outside of the US just wouldn‚Äôt work.

I am almost certain she makes FTC becuse she has had the most consistent level of content the whole game. However, it‚Äôs been somewhat mixed.

Fuck I honestly cannot stand the idiots screaming in voice chat sometimes. I think your explanation is perfect, in any game, I honestly rely on sounds more than anything.   Specifically OW, I'll crank my sound up to the point where I can ALWAYS here a Sombra walking any where near my team, I can get stuns off with McCree without ever seeing her.  But then some BITCH in voice chat screaming all game is asking why everyone sucks and it's probably cause NO ONE CAN HEAR ANYTHING but yO WHINNY ASS VOICE.  I have anxiety and I'll get super worked up the second someone starts talking shit to me, I'll start playing like utter crap because my hands just can't be still anymore.   The only thing that calms me is straight up forgetting I'm in a game for a second, giving this shitty person a bit of their own medicine, and proceeding to go off whilst saying "maybe if you shut up for a couple seconds and stopped talking (or typing if I'm not actually in voice chat) we'd actually stand a chance".  Nothing shuts a man up faster than another man with a calm mindset and powerful words.   If possible, (almost always is) you can make them look like an idiot with little to no repercussions.  I've only reported a few people in my time, and a couple days after nearly all of them, I've recieved an email stating that the person has been suspended or banned.  Conclusion: Don't be afraid to tell off shitty people, more often than not, your kindness towards others will put them off and they won't be a problem. A very vocal minority that I refuse to be quieted by anymore

The graph does show a clear decline in the infections and this is what we need to get out when it come's to loosening restrictions: We have to endure. A few more weeks and it will be enough to starve it out to the point it can be controlled and managed.   That being said they should allow the likes of woodies to reopen if anything to just distract people and keep them busy, home improvements are certainly one way of keeping people both active and staying at home at the same time. Might have the added benefit of drawing people away from the bloody supermarkets too I think people are going there just for something to do.

The incidence rate of metastatic cSCC is around 2.5%, so it is pretty rare. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22592943/   But it absolutely does need to be treated.  I work in oncology cancer research specializing in cancer staging and treatment. I had to take a national certification exam to do the work I do and I‚Äôve never once purported to be a doctor (and would never). I review cancer case cases to make sure they are following appropriate NCCN guidelines for treatment. I also manage a group of over 20 people with the same certification that do the same job. I‚Äôve probably reviewed close to 10,000 cases over the last 10 years. In the last 10 years I‚Äôve seen maybe 2 cases that have needed more than excision or radiation. I haven‚Äôt seen anyone need cemiplimab yet. I‚Äôm sure the cases are out there- I personally haven‚Äôt seen them yet. I‚Äôve worked on cases in Massachusetts, Alabama, and Texas.

Yes but the 'small' difference is whether or not one is saved.

I wouldn't tell anyone, and I hate to say this, but friends and family (INCLUDING PARENTS) period, except those who have legal right to know or a fiduciary financial advisor. Money can change people, not only the people who have it, but the people around them, money can be amazing and it can be evil as fuck. Get comfortable interviewing financial advisors, don't settle on the first one that you talk to, meet with several, ask about their experiences in working with people who have came into sudden wealth. And get very comfortable asking if they are a fiduciary, because ANYONE can be a financial advisor, there's no real school or certification that makes one certified to be one.
So did your puzzle.

We locked down months after some countries and are starting to reopen at the same time or before some of them because our way of life was barely sustainable in the first place.  We are about to become a hotspot reinfecting the rest of the world when they've done their due diligence and are finally ready to open responsibly.  And we STILL aren't testing properly or providing PPE while we're stealing other countries shipments.  Hell the feds are even stealing our own shipments.  We deserve to be ostracized and ridiculed by the rest of the world.
Sorry mate missed that! New to this whole process. When deciding on a watch, do you just post on the forum of the trusted dealers, pay, then they send you pics to approve/reject, then get sent the watch?

'14' '14 and you give people your personal information...' 'GO AWAY NOOB'  Someone else said: 'Ur a boomer' 'How?' 'Because of the way you talk' 'I never said a single word until you called me a boomer' 'And that doesn't answer my question. Why. Am. I. A. Boomer.'  They then left.

This is a great TWAB and I like the sound of what they are considering doing  Unfortunately the reason I'm done with this game is because Bungie has proven time and time again that they are completely willing to fix what isn't broken and I have no guarantee that the game will stay good and Bungie won't find some way in the future to screw this up. Every season and expansion feels like a gamble now.

Since I didn't see anyone mention it, this has been Venomancer's lore since forever. Since before Valve got involved with dota.  A lot of the lore is.  Not criticizing or anything.

Its actually not as bad as I thought and most of the videos are us just dancing or makeup type stuff.  me and my sister fight a lot and don't get along very often its nothing serious just sibling rivalry.  But anyways she wanted to post a couple dances and a make up tutorial to the account and right now I have not been in the best health wise and have a sore throat and I look like I am sick (don't worry its nothing bad).  But I told her no, she kept pestering me and told me to stop being a baby and get it over it.  It takes us almost an hour to make like 4-5 cause we either mess up or try to fix stuff.  I kept trying to tell her no that I'm not doing any tik tok dances with her and that I don't feel good.  After while my mom told us to be quiet, and now she's saying that I should have just humored my sister. AITA for not making tik-toks with my sister?  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Agreed with everything you said here.  I think it's important to know that in K-pop, just because a certain group is doing a concept, doesn't necessarily mean that it's everyone in the group's favorite genre.  Of course, there's enough Dreamcatcher content out there where you can reasonably conclude that most of Dreamcatcher does indeed love their concept.  But to clarify, that also doesn't mean that it's their number 1 favorite concept of all time.  Jiu and Yoohyeon both seem to gravitate towards more pop concepts when given the choice to do what they want.  Dami loves hip hop, Sua I'm not 100% sure about.  Siyeon is probably the only one who's a "natural" fit for the Dreamcatcher concept.
Yup, Kevin O'Leary brought that one to my attention a couple weeks ago and it is already up about 12%

I applied for EI on April 2nd, right after I was told by my bosses that there would not be any work any time soon. Been waiting to do my job search reports or trying to reach someone but to no avail. My application is not even showing up on my service Canada account. I understand the amount of people trying to get through and everything, but when I hear and read of people getting financial aid without even applying I can't help but feel frustrated. I tried that service request link that someone else posted but even that hasn't bore any results yet. Now it's the 1st of May and I'm not sure I'll be able to get help to pay my bills on time.

S√¨ purtroppo, per pigrizia intellettuale (e altri motivi), se una persona X si identifica come femminista/socialista/...ista, in molti la considerano in quel modo, anche se le sue azioni/pensieri hanno ben poco a che fare con il movimento. Quindi a causa di un gruppo ristretto di persone estremiste che si auto definiscono femministe, si sta condannando un intero movimento che ha avuto un ruolo importante nell‚Äôultimo secolo.  Bisognerebbe ricordarsi che a ‚Äúdeterminare‚Äù cosa sono, non √® come io mi definisco, ma ci√≤ che dico e faccio.   In un certo senso il femminismo adesso sta vivendo quello che il Marxismo ha vissuto nel 20¬∫ secolo, sta venendo criticato/osteggiato a causa di figure che con il movimento stesso .non hanno nulla da spartire...  Oddio non so se son riuscito a spiegarmi...
**Summary:**   Twitter said that this access could also be used by approved applicants working on crisis management, emergency response or communication within communities, as well as those developing machine learning and data tools to help the scientific community understand COVID-19. Social media platforms have both introduced new policies to curb COVID-19 misinformation and warned that there may be errors due to their reliance on more automated moderation systems during the pandemic. Researchers studying the platforms have argued that the companies must collect data about this period. European Commissioner Vera Jourova called Twitter‚Äôs move ‚Äúa good step in the right direction.‚Äù ‚ÄúOur cooperation and regular contacts with online platforms to fight disinformation are bearing fruit. I have constantly underlined the importance for researchers to have better access to useful non-personal data and tools,‚Äù she said. Last week, 75 groups and individuals, including digital rights and free speech organizations, wrote an open letter to social media platforms asking them to preserve and publish their content moderation data. However, Twitter said that once tweets were taken down, they would have to be removed from this COVID-19 data set. Currently, Twitter‚Äôs free, public API access offers a small percentage of its full stream of tweets, although the company does provide greater levels of access to paying clients. Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before, and that it represented tens of thousands of dollars per month in data. Researchers will be able to access tweets created from the moment they connect to the data set, but it will not provide historical data. In the blog post, it said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream endpoint, but they must meet a set of requirements, including that the use case supports ‚Äúthe public good.‚Äù Applicants will also have to explain how they will protect the privacy and safety of people represented in the data. Twitter said that researchers would be bound by its usual rules projects analyzing health-related topics, for example, not deriving or inferring information about a Twitter user‚Äôs health and not storing any personal data about such sensitive information.
That is a good nuanced view. I just personally view that if it was all private there would be no need to fill such a gap because it wouldn't exist due to healthcare being so much more efficient. And it wouldn't be a premium because from the points I mentioned it would cheap enough to pay out of pocket, since that is what the free market would push for.
haha that‚Äôs okay! This season already  annoys me so much I can‚Äôt even be phased by that.

If you move or bend over and it rubs then it could be the case. You can test it by putting a bandage or covering over the spot. Or not wearing a belt for a bit. Either way if you isolate the spot from the irritant then you can rule it in or out.  Good luck, skin stuff is maddening and People that haven't lived it don't respect that as much as they should.

A) I like how all you people trying to slander and ignore Biden's rape accusations have masstags, /r/hatecrimehoaxes user  B) Biden's friends with Epstein too.  In fact a big reason Epstein got away with things as long as he did is because he catered to and cultivated contacts with politicians and influential rich people on every side of the establishment he could.  BTW Biden's up to 8 accusers and counting.  You really wanna keep trying to downplay a rapist with an appeal to worse problems? I'm sure that's a great way to get us four more years of Trump and a lifetime of an alt right supreme court.  Shame you valued beating "socialism" over not supporting a rapist.  But hey, the only people who suffer are women, minorities, and the poor.  Good thing you're not part of that group, right, genius?

Depends what area you're planning on living in. Campgrounds in the northeast typically offer seasonal rates for the summer (anywhere from Apr 1- Oct 31) however they usually close over the winter. There aren't many restrictions in the southeast and you can basically live at a campground. Certain states allow you to live in a camper on your own property (Maine for example) but I'm not sure about which others. You can always dry camp on state game land. A p.o. box is your best bet as far as a permanent address and as for internet, we have a hotspot as well as our phones and haven't had too many service issues.

Yes, you'll often hear the "all sides" argument from the right wing. What they fail to mention is that the biased sources on the left do not get the readership/listenership/viewership that the right-wing media do. Additionally, the mainstream media does a pretty darn good job at being unbiased. This chart is a fair representation.

**Summary:**   Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of fossil bones from the tail of ‚ÄãSpinosaurus in southeastern Morocco that provided a deeper understanding of the appearance, lifestyle and capabilities of the longest meat-eating dinosaur on record. ‚ÄúSpinosaurus had a highly specialized tail - a propulsive structure that would have allowed this river monster to actively pursue prey in the water column,‚Äù said University of Detroit Mercy paleontologist and anatomist Nizar Ibrahim, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. Spinosaurus, which lived 95 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, was a highly unusual dinosaur, and not just because of its staggering dimensions - up to 50 feet (15 meters) long and seven tons. The anatomy of Spinosaurus had remained mysterious for decades after crucial fossils were destroyed during World War Two until the 2008 discovery of the Morocco skeleton, with the additional tail bones dug up since 2015. Its tail was flexible with a large surface area thanks to a series of tall neural spines - different from the stiff and tapering tails of other carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex - indicating Spinosaurus and its close relatives engaged in tail-propelled locomotion unlike any other dinosaurs. Laboratory experiments in which a plastic model of the Spinosaurus tail was attached to a robotic swimming device showed that the tail could move laterally to create thrust and power the animal through water like a crocodile, said Harvard University fish biologist and biomechanist George Lauder, a study co-author. This indicates Spinosaurus terrorized rivers and river banks as a semi-aquatic animal, not merely wading into the water waiting for fish to swim by. It may have eaten huge fish, including sharks. ‚ÄúThis discovery overturns decades-old ideas that non-bird dinosaurs were restricted to terrestrial environments,‚Äù said Harvard University vertebrate paleontologist and biomechanist Stephanie Pierce, a study co-author. ‚ÄúSo, yes, we believe that this discovery does indeed revolutionize our understanding of dinosaur biology.‚Äù Spinosaurus still was able to move on land and lay eggs there, perhaps walking on four legs rather than two like other meat-eating dinosaurs.

Honestly, The struggle of getting the reach i wanted with my first ht from baofeng was what pushed me deeper. It got me building antennas and then eventually learning about cables and their loss, The faults lead to new discoveries and further research, i feel if your pushed away from something being difficult then your not really interested in the first place.   Others say its a waste of money to make worse things work alittle better but knowledge is priceless and that experience you gain in the process of trying pushes you further than you would reach just being handed what you want.

&gt;Does grinding fresh really make that much of a difference, [...]  Yes, it does. The closest to a contrary take is hardware retailers' in-house study that does as much to justfy spending even more on a grinder as it does to justify not spending.  Grinding fresh still makes a huge difference, they just think that a nicer grinder makes even more of a difference. &gt;If I do get a grinder, which one should I get? I'd mostly be interested in manual ones since I live with roommates and wouldn't want to bother them with noise. I'm ideally looking to spend as little as possible to get a decent quality grinder, but am set on spending no more than $80.  With that budget, pretty much all that's worthwhile within your range are either Hario Skerton or Porlex; neither is amazing, but will at least be fresh-ground.

**Summary:**   Germany began easing its lockdown last week, when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing, but Chancellor Angela Merkel and government advisers are worried about the coronavirus infection rate rising. The reproductive rate, known as ‚ÄòR‚Äô, is at just under one in Germany, Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said on Tuesday. That means one person with the virus infects about one other person on average. Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7. In a joint statement, scientists from Germany‚Äôs Fraunhofer Society, the Helmholtz and Leibniz Associations, and the Max Planck Society must be kept low. ‚ÄúThe situation is not stable, even a small increase in the reproductive rate would take us back to a phase of exponential growth,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúTherefore, until a vaccine becomes available, the reproduction rate must be kept below 1,‚Äù they said, adding that ‚Äúconsistent contact restrictions‚Äù remained necessary. Germany has reported 157,641 coronavirus cases but carried out early and extensive testing and the death toll has been relatively low at 6,115. The education ministers of Germany‚Äôs 16 federal states agreed on Tuesday that schools would slowly reopen classes for all grades by the summer holidays, although pupils would have to work and learn in smaller groups. Retailers with floor space of up to 800 square metres are now allowed to open, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookstores, though they must practise strict social distancing and hygiene rules. Merkel will discuss the next steps for easing the lockdown restrictions in a telephone conference with the state premiers on Thursday, and again on May 6. The scientists from the four institutes said data available so far showed that achieving herd immunity - when enough people in a population have immunity to an infection to be able to effectively stop that disease from spreading - would take several years if the healthcare system is not to be overloaded.
I peed blood one other time last July (went through my images in phone and got exact date because, I take pictures for reference sake) and it cleared up under 24 hours, that's why I didnt rush to the ER, but I can understand how crazy and stupid my post sounded in retrospect.
Do you understand what words mean?  degenerate   having lost the physical, mental, or moral qualities considered normal and desirable; showing evidence of decline.   It was never normal nor desirable in human civilized history to go to an 8 y.o. boy and flash your genitalia.
~~If you go generic HGH, you‚Äôll likely need to run double the dose to get the same effect as pharma.~~ **See u/DecaTest‚Äôs comment below.**  Tell her to stay away from clen‚Äîit‚Äôs bad news. Look up the cardio toxicity of it. u/DecaTest, can you link your studies?  My advice would be to stick with the Bronkaid (I‚Äôm very happy with it) coupled with caffeine or go with albuterol which is extremely cheap and can likely be found wherever she was going to get her clen. With a caloric deficit of 500-1000, the fat will melt off.  Another option is HGH Frag 176-191 which has promising effects on fat loss and is quite cheaper than HGH.
Hi! Commenting as a viewer :)   Aww, I really like your videos at first glance! You're super welcoming and make a point of engaging with the camera. It feels more like a hangout vs just spectating. I also really enjoy your room setup and blue lighting tint.   Watching your recent video (yesterday) and I like the mic quality and video quality. I wish I had more constructive feedback! Just wanted to drop a note of appreciation and encouragement! High quality continuity with the overlay, main page panels, colours, and your logo!  Would love to follow along and see how your journey goes!
You are welcome. Pleasant surprise. Clinton emails are in there too.
Actually last call averaged a about 115,000 more viewers than her show did. They shoved her everywhere, superbowl commercial, nba roast, covid videos. She is unfunny, plain and simple. Go to a taping of the show. If your told to laugh so people at home know when to laugh, thats a problem. The truth is she doesnt get a laugh untill the audience gets the signal to laugh. Woke culture is almost out the door. People are tired of blatant, racist content being aloud simply becuase its against the right color. Dave Chappell makes jokes at white people's expense, difference is, the jokes are funny.
You need to register, I think. Contact the moderators. :) And Happy Cake Day.
Laissez Faire economics and social darwinism actually were tried in the past and failed miserably. That's why we have antitrust laws today
This is epic make more
Thanks! I'll check it out
There are a lot of ready made frames that have this done at the factory. The problem is that may people want a frame manufactured specifically to their own body dimensions. It is basically like a tailor made suit, there are no two alike.   Also bile frames are made to be light above all else. This means it is really easy to bend things out of alignment if you fall.

So glad you posted before this got taken down (3 minutes after you comment), this software is perfect thanks!
You mean the ‚Äúhold up imma grab a snack‚Äù combos? Sorry but these are too long.
