I think an "upbeat" playlist is a good idea, but maybe that's your "bad day". I also like a "beautiful" playlist. It probably overlaps with "relaxing", but not necessarily. How about an all instrumental one (maybe certain types - sax or trumpet, or keyboard). Songs about a certain narrow era - the fall of the Berlin Wall, Vietman War, something like that. They don't have to be *from* the era necessarily, just relating to it. Do a comedy one. Do an all Australian one (maybe some overlap there)! Irish bands. Music that requires the *least* listening to - say for background during dinner - sometimes handy. A nostalgia list. A list from one year on your life that was significant. The top hits from one important week in your life, even.
Yeah, apparently labia are okay if there is some type of material, however thin, in-between them.  At my office I get nervous if NSFW as a label in a list of links pops up on screen.

I am skeptical.  Call me when he takes a firm stand against any more bank bailouts. When he announces that we are pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan. When he will have Congress craft a bill to repudiate the Patriot Act.  Until then, we have a lot of talk, and Obama signing a bunch of hand outs to the special interest groups that support Democrats. This Obama cheer leading makes me mentally vomit, especially when it comes from the AP.
Try again. The GOP congress-critters were, as they are now, playing politics.  They were doing their part as the minority party, and what I said was that the bailout was LESS controversial - the talking heads whined less, and the house GOP voted, in part, for the bill.  There was no consensus against the bailout.

&gt;Given that withouth subsidies for leaving fields fallow, farmers will plant over them every year  I disagree with this assertion.  Crop rotation can be done by all farmers together, forming a farming co-operative. They do it out of self-preservation because they know that if they don't they're all gonna ruin their fields.  There is potential for government PENALTIES to be levied against farmers who don't participate in some kind of rotation. But that's as far as I would go. This is the same as dealing with any other free rider effect such as pollution. You tax pollution in one way or another. Failing to rotate your crops could easily be seen as a form of pollution.  The role of government is to force businesses to internalize their externalities. However, this is NOT what the centrally-planned agriculture economy has done.

In sensible units it's even better (since subtracting MPG is meaningless):  14 to 23 mpg is a reduction of 6.6 L/100 km.  34 to 45 mpg is a reduction of 1.7 L/100 km.  The first one is therefore eliminates 3.9 times as much fuel use.
I think we have a personal responsibility to change all we can.  However, for me to think I can take down corporatism or government corruption could be delusional and thus demoralizing when I don't do so, leading back to "ignore it" problem.  I do think we can and should make a dent, though.

 Current VW diesel cars, with a standard transmission, get about 50mpg (imperial) give or take 10mpg depending on how you drive.
Try switching it around more.  You're a hetereo guy or girl but everyone around you is entirely gay.  The only time you ever get any action at all is when a gay boy or girl makes out with you just because it's funny.  You never actually get to have a partner to take home for a quick shag, and you never have a serious partner you can build a relationship on.  Meanwhile, your loneliness gets worse and worse and worse, you're treated as an outcast or a freak.  If you don't see how that can suck, you fail at empathy.
AMERICA! FUCK YEAH!
&gt;Karl Marx found it aggravating that the Communards "lost precious moments" organising democratic elections rather than instantly finishing off Versailles once and for all. France's national bank, located in Paris and storing billions of francs, was left untouched and unguarded by the Communards. Timidly they asked to borrow money from the bank (which of course they got without any hesitation).  I have sometimes wondered if this would have changed the course of french history...

While not explicitly expressed anywhere that I've seen (and I don't read Japanese), my sense is that the developers felt it was more important to get a stable release of the code out the door early, instead of delaying it by polishing the documentation, fixing every last low-priority bug and so on. You will probably see a 1.9.2 relatively quickly, and hopefully we will see some interest in improving the documentation soon.

Well if you are accusing me of being on a bandwagon, it would be a first.  I was raised by atheist parents.  I didn't really draw the weak/hard distinction until I learned formal logic.  &gt;So it's preferable that the word "atheist" refer to a full range of probabilities  No, and that is the essence of my point.  I think the atheist label should be reserved for people who think the probability is nil, or 1 in near infinity (which are functionally the same).  As soon as you start backing off of the nigh-impossible end of the spectrum, I think its fine to start using the agnostic label, but I don't think too many agnostics are too far from that extreme end anyway.  &gt;why people insist on making the term atheist so ambiguous  I don't think what I have described is ambiguous at all. &gt;I've always disagreed with Dawkins saying this; it is simply wrong. No theist would ever use the word "atheist" to apply to themselves even in regards to the gods of others.  But that does not make the argument logically invalid or Dawkins wrong.  It is an airtight argument (which is why Dawkins uses it) from a logical standpoint.  It has nothing to do with whether theists would acknowledge it or not.
As long as he's not doing it during competition or before competition so as to test positive, the IOC shouldn't have any say in it.

I'm saying that it's possible (conceivable, not likely) that what theists perceive as their "god" could actually have some correlate in reality.  &gt; That we might not fully understand something natural and mislabel it doesn't change the nature of that thing.  I don't think it's that simple.  You're begging the question by defining that a true god needs to be supernatural in a way that can't be explained naturally.  I disagree.  Our experience has shown repeatedly that what was once called supernatural can have natural explanations.  If an alien intelligence were actually responsible for interfering in human development on a regular basis along the lines that religions believe, then that could provide a "natural" referent for the concept "god".  Would such an understanding mean that that intelligence is *not* god?  If so, why?  It's likely to mean that it doesn't exactly match literal Judeo-Christian notions of god, but as I said I'm a strong atheist with respect to those.  Nevertheless, a sentient being which created our universe or even just prepared Earth for us, fostered the creation of life, and took an ongoing interest in the development of that life, intervening in ways that are beyond our current understanding, would correspond closely enough to my understanding of the meaning of "god" that I would consider it reasonable to say that "god exists" if evidence of such an entity were discovered.  At the very least, one would have to say that theists were onto something, even if they had some of the details wrong.  I'd be extremely surprised if that were the case, but I'm saying it's conceivable.  In that situation, claiming that that's not really a god would seem to rather miss the point.  Note that extra-dimensional beings could have capabilities that would forever remain beyond our understanding, and appear supernatural to us.  Our brains have proved extremely weak at understanding what can happen in a universe with larger numbers of spatial dimensions, and a being with access to those dimensions and an intelligence capable of exploiting them could be indistinguishable from a god, to us.  More generally, as I touched on in my previous comment, the notion of "supernatural" is philosophically problematic.  What seems supernatural to us would by definition be natural to the superentity performing those supernatural operations.  Again, this implies that a superentity might occupy its own universe, with its own rules.  The idea of some physical universe "outside" our physical universe fits perfectly with this conception.  The fact that this situation might conceivably be explained "naturally" in some sense involving extra-universal physics doesn't seem to undermine reasonable definitions of "god".

My first car was an '85 Audi 5000 (before you think I'm rich, it cost $200). The engine and mechanical engineering on that car was amazing (5 cylinder inline engine, very neat). It had well over a quarter of a million miles on it before I sold it and got a Civic.   However, the electronics sucked (except for the cruise control which seemed to be based on vacuum technology somehow, and consequently did not suck). The power sunroof, power windows, fan blower motor, automatic door locks, dashboard, etc. pretty much all died constantly and took at lot of work to keep working. I have to assume it is a good thing they are not going the hybrid electric car route unless they have vastly improved their electrical design.

we should know 1 dollar = 100 cents .01 dollar = 1 cent  bear with the stretch, so using 2 cents .02 dollar = 2 cents therefore .00002 dollars = .002 cents  Isn't moving the decimal fun?  Though Verizon workers are in the US, so gotta give them some slack for never converting to the metric system, therefore getting little practice simply moving the decimal. 35893 *  .00002 dollars = .71786 dollars (then move the decimal point 2 times to get how many dollars are owed) or 35893 *  .002 cents = 71.786 cents

There is a case to be made for resentment against Evangelical Christianity.  Take, for instance, the case of Religulous and Expelled from last year.  Both films used dubious methods of film-making, preached to the choir, and thrilled their target audiences (and few others).  But one of them has 10% on rotten tomatoes (and is called dishonest) and the other has 70+% (and is called a scathing critique).  As a believer, I find that annoying.  I won't call it persecution or "bashing," but I will call it hypocritical.  And it makes me doubt just that too many in our country care all that much about faith.
Do the evolution.
You might be able to put something like that together in firegestures, but I'm not 100% on that.

Fair enough.
You can disagree with it, but I've presented an historical example (The Great Dust Bowl) where farmers did not work together to preserve the long term health of their soil, which lead to immense drought and large scale loss of food production.  What is different about the market now compared to then that makes you think this would not happen again?  Another example is the soil in most of the Southeast (Virginia/Georiga) where tobacco was grown.  It is absolutely horrible soil now - but at the time, it was great, and they grew it every year until they could get nothing more out of it.  Given that the time scales to destroy soil are often long compared to human lifespan / market demands (say, ~50-100 years), there is little incentive for a farmer to take too much concern with these.  While the free market is often good with short term things, it seems to fail miserably on long term goals.  For instance, oil (given that it is finite) should be insanely expensive, yet it is absurdly cheap to fill up a car.  Addtionally, you have not addressed my primary economic point of the boom bust cycle of farming.  Is it addressed in the book you've recommended?  Note that I feel farming is distinct from other businesses, and therefore would need to be specifically addressed - just saying they can do it like other businesses (when evidence suggests they are not like other businesses and they serve a vital role to civilization) is not sufficient to sway me.

Maybe, he got elected regardless of color.  Just a thought.
&gt;However, by being a "certain" atheist, are you really any better than a "certain" theist?  I'll answer this but in a re-phrased way so it doesn't sound ad hominem.  I would ask, "do you think one flavor of atheism has any more logical support than any other?"  To which I would answer, yes.  As you said yourself, I prefer to draw conclusions from evidence.  Since there is no evidence of the existence of god, I cannot believe a god exists.  But since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, I cannot logically say that I believe god does not exist.  However, I can put a relative perceived probability on whether god exists, and as such, I'd say the odds are 1 in nearly infinity.  So for any functional purpose in terms of living my life, I am functionally a hard atheist I guess.  PS:  It is really bad to conflate beliefs with individuals.  Your original question about being better than this or that, was phrased in just such a conflating way.  I know what you meant, but too many people don't, and they end up thinking you are trying to criticize them personally rather than their beliefs.

Once, I went to a strip joint, and one of the dancers was wearing glitter.  Well, somehow, some of the glitter got on me, and when I woke up the next morning, the glitter had transferred from me to the pillowcase, and indeed onto my wife's face.  In a moment of inspiration, as she opened her eyes, I said, "hey, where'd this glitter come from?".  She immediately went on the defensive: "uhm, I have no idea."  But now, I had the upper hand, being that I brought it up.  This is what the wingers are doing here.  They know full well that the news is propaganda, and by firing the first shot, they gain the advantage of being the ones who "brought it up".  Thus, if anyone were to draw a comparison to propaganda disseminated by them in the Shrub years, it will be dismissed as a whiney "so did you!"  If you want to understand the wingnuts, you have to think like a 12 year old bully in the school yard.

You can still benefit from steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs if they're not in your system.

Exactly I still have no clue why gold is yellow instead of gray.  At least I learned why gray is the color I should expect gold to be.

Waking up curled up and warm under my blanket but the room itself is cold, realizing I have no place to be and just still sleepy enough that I slowly drift off while I stretch. God, it makes me want to go to sleep right now so I can wake up and then go back to sleep.

Some of my favorites include:   Nietzsche's "Beyond Good And Evil", "The Antichrist", "Twilight of the Idols", and other works.   Le Marquis de Sade's "Philosophy in the Bedroom", "Dialogue Between a Dying Man and a Priest" and other works (If you can handle it. Sade is thought by some to have inspired Nietzsche)   Bertram Russell's "Why I Am Not A Christian"  Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World: Science As A Candle In The Dark"
Whatever, if I take a girl to dinner to break up with her I'm not going to be pissed if she bails.  What, you want to hang around and finish the meal in awkwardness?
That's why it's brilliant. 
Possibly because we don't supply the government of Sri Lanka with dump trucks full of cash on a regular basis like Israel.  Perhaps there would be more outrage if, 60 years ago, all the Tamil people had been forced out of their houses and off their land by people from all over the world claiming to be the owners by divine right.   To my knowledge, the conflict in Sri Lanka is a civil war and both sides have lived on the Island for generations. I don't claim to be an expert though.

It will happen because the Democrats will abuse their power (it's almost inevitable.)  Look at the economic stimulus package - they prevent Republicans from having a say (just like they did 10-15 years ago when they were in power) and added all sorts of pork barrel to it.  The excesses will come to haunt them later and the Republicans will regain power.  The Republicans will do the same and so on.

I'm glad you liked it, even if you already knew about it.  &gt;I'm not sure, however, of what perceptions I have of bonobos that you felt would be widened.  I have no way of knowing your background or familiarity with the subject at hand.  Thus my word choice: "may."
Wrong. Banks gave loans to people who couldn't afford them. I'll gladly "goose" the economy by refinancing.
Much of the stimulus will be going back to the states at least indirectly. In my area, I know of at least two long overdue highway projects that are on the list to be expedited through the stimulus package.   Makes sense to me. If the workers who were building houses before can build roads and bridges now rather than collect unemployment, we're all better off.

What does Squeak offer over Ruby? I agree that the language is simpler and cleaner, but the libraries and implementation are in a poor state. Also the 'sources file' model is quite a pain to work with, because you can't use your own text editor or version control. I never saw much of a distinction between Python, Ruby, Squeak, and Perl; they're all suitable for quick-and-dirty scripts but I wouldn't want to develop a large application in any of them. The languages don't scale to programming in the large and there are performance problems.
&gt;Actually, the point of my argument is that we wouldn't automatically grant rights to the rest of the apes because of that exception. Similarly, we shouldn't take rights away because of exceptions.  But you do feel that we should grant extra rights to individuals because of exceptions:  &gt;would we grant rights to all apes? No, just the one ape.  So why wouldn't we take the rights of individuals away because of exceptions?  It seems to me that, in the absence of a further argument, this would be the proportional and most obvious response.  Perhaps you feel that rights are species based rather than based on individuals, but the argument you gave does not actually suggest this.  Stumbles047 did not suggest that emphasizing capacity would strip all humans of ethical responsibilities, merely that emphasizing capacity would suggest that individual humans of differing capacities would be subject to different ethical responsibilities.  &gt;The question itself is an open one that I'm not claiming to know the answer to, but the fact that it is open tells me that capacity is not enough in itself to make a determination of how an entity should be treated.  &gt;&gt;This is not an argument, though. This is the absence of an argument. Accordingly, veganism is just as valid as omnivorism.  I think we are talking past each other, this argument was not concerning the validity of veganism.  The question of whether or not it would be "right" to withdraw care from a terminal patient does not need to be answered in this context, because it isn't relevant except in that it confirms that we can perceive a difference in the ethical or moral actions concerning an individual who lives in one society to that of the an individual of similar capacities in a different context.  In other words, it was confirming the suggestion that capability is not the sole means of determining "rights".  I made no direct argument connecting this to the question of veganism and omnivorism, it was simply a response to the problem suggested by stumbles047.

Specialty gases.  Many of the products are priced similarly to precious metals and while you may not be able to sweep them up, it's not _that_ difficult to consolidate the material.

States are broke because most of our taxes go to the Fed.  States take between 2% and 6% of our income while the Fed takes around 30%.  So I would rather pay 30% to the state and 6% to the Fed.  At the state and local level, we have more of a say in the use of our dollars.

I blew out a tire right in the middle of downtown Atlanta on the interstate - not a great area.  I was on my way to pick a friend up at the airport.  This was before everyone had cell phones.  I was despairing that my trial by fire on spare-tire replacement was going to be on this freezing cold day when I was in a big hurry, with no way to tell my friend I'd be late.  But as soon as I got onto the side of the road, a car pulled up behind me and the nice gentleman changed my tire for me while his significant other let me use her cellphone so I could coordinate passing a message on to the friend.  I ended up getting to the airport before he did anyway.  It turned an instantly crappy day into a great one, what nice people.
&gt; For instance, an object with just one instance variable needs no less than 27 words (plus a couple for malloc overhead), or ~116 bytes on x86 (it gets obviously worse on x64).  Oh wow, I didn't know that. In that case then, you're right, a couple of words per hashtable entry isn't going to make a big difference.

Are you serious?  You read every lien of code for every library you ever use?  Does it take you years to finish any project?  At some point in my life, I decided that it was okay to assume the library providers were not incompetent.  In the rare cases it turns out to be incorrect, *then* I might look at all of the inner workings of the library.
&gt;What is different about the market now compared to then that makes you think this would not happen again?  People aren't ignorant anymore. We have extremely good communications and information systems. Farming is a very different thing than it used to be.  &gt;Addtionally, you have not addressed my primary economic point of the boom bust cycle of farming.  Yes I did. Farmers can deal with boom/busts in the same way every other business does. Farmers are not the only people who have this issue.  Crop insurance is a pretty obvious way to deal with this, and co-ops can be set up where farmers insure each other for bargain-basement prices.  You don't need a centrally-planned economy to deal with boom/busts. EVERY business has this issue. Only farmers have the voting power to vote themselves taxpayer dollars though.  By the way, I'm from Saskatchewan, where we have two industries for hundreds of miles - farming, and potash. So I'm not a noob on farming. My grandparents were all born on farms and owned farms and were family farmers. Including ranchers and dairy farmers as well as normal crop farmers.

You're probably using the reccomended Qt libs. I'm not, because they're old, they don't have bug fixes which fix some other QT based apps and they're generally slower. I don't think that "good" software should depend on the microversion of a toolkit, ie it's quirks.

&gt;While you are correct in your facts about parallel circuits, the person + fabric parallel circuit would become a zero-ohm resistor that is in series with the output resistor (impedance) of the taser.  I'm not sure where you're getting the "zero-ohm" part. If the human body's resistance is 500 ohms (accounting for the fact that the prongs pierce through the skin), and the fabric is 0.1 ohms, then the resistance for the circuit is 1/(1/500 + 1/0.1) = .09998 ohms.

It is an absurd analogy.  Whether you believe in God or not, if you are philosophical there will be many occasions where when you are reducing the matter of discussion to simples you run into an absurdity or a paradox; at which point the question would arise - Does God (or supernaturality) exist?
That data is from 2001, so I am guessing it is talking incandescent bulbs, not compact florescent...

Maybe the initially allocation of money seems unfair but you have to admit that the system generates a bigger pie than any other system.  It does trickle down.  The rich people will spend more money on boats, for example.  The boat makers get richer and spend more money on cookies...you get the picture.  A system that limits profits will yield a smaller pie - everyone has a smaller amount.
No because there are no nude pictures being captured.

I think it's great that they want to improve Ogg, but most of that article doesn't make much sense.  First of all, while the Adobe tools cost money, you don't need them. Flash supports h.264, and there's x264 for the encoding. If progressive download is good enough for the purpose, then Apache (or others) can deliver the video just fine. If you need streaming, there are projects like Red5 and haXeVideo.  Also, if you want to get a foot in the door against Flash, h.264 is the way to go /because/ Flash supports it -- you could embed it the same way you would with Ogg, but you'd have the Flashplayer as a fall-back if the user's browser doesn't support it. Otherwise, it's just chicken and egg all over again.
I understand the theoretical differences.  Yes our constitution doesn't have a bill of rights.  But in PRACTICE the American government doesn't seem to respect the constitution, and attempts to work around it.  Also - don't know if this is true, but isn't there a constitution free zone within 100 miles of the border?  Does that mean the bill of rights isn't valid in this area?  And hence there isn't actual free speech here, only implied?   
Regardless of the original intent, I think people quickly realise that it's a framework and nothing more. Given that schedules tend to fall behind anyway, it only takes a junior maybe two projects to figure out what's going on. Also, I've never worked with a senior team member who looked at a Gantt chart and actually took it at face value.   As JeffMo says, it's the authority figure or project sponsor that's the real problem. Even then, most don't buy into the certainty either. What they're *really* after is a fall guy who they can point to if things screw up. Of course, no-one would admit to this, but that's what's really going on in people's heads.  That's why all these pseudo-scientific management practices are so successful in large companies: it gives management a way to deflect blame.
It's the early 80s in West Florida. My parents had just gotten married and they were so happy. If there ever were a moment I'd want to really watch and experience, it'd be then. God, they looked so happy and free. If I could time travel, right then is what I'd want to see. No questions asked.
Wow, out of all the events in the history of man-kind you would choose this?
&gt;the fact that the employer was able to gain consent doesn't make the situation voluntary all of a sudden.  No one is using them as cause/effect, so I'm not sure who you're arguing against.  Consent is simply a choice made in a voluntary context.  Absent the voluntary context, "consent" doesn't apply.  &gt;Right but going to a desert island here amounts to what Rothbard called a "lifeboat scenario" approach to ethics.   Not at all.  I was simply addressing your implication that "If you don't work, then you'll starve to death or freeze" was sufficient to label the employment context as "not voluntary".  &gt;Point blank: consent != voluntary  Of course it does, otherwise you wouldn't call it consent in the first place.  Though it seems like the position you are arguing against is "because you consented it is voluntary".  I don't know of any libertarian who would argue there is a cause/effect relationship at all, much less that it runs in that direction. &gt;Employment is predicate on consent, not a voluntary choice.  One can only "consent" if the context is a voluntary one.  &gt;Since \[employment] is not "voluntary" in any reasonable sense...  Pardon?  Perhaps this is the source of contention, rather than the usage of the word "consent" (which by the way, you brought up).  &gt;you can't categorically say any and all employment is **justified.**  I thought we were talking about whether something is voluntary.  &gt;Which is what right-wing libertarians usually say.  Not sure to whom you're referring, but from your comments, it sounds like you're fighting an imaginary foe.
What's the difference? Seriously.
No direction of his own? Are you kidding?  Of course Obama is going to do everything the diametrically opposite to Bush. Bush is an idiot, and a criminal.

&gt; If you do not know what is out there, why do you have to give it a name "god" ?  The issue is that some people believe they know what is out there.  They may not have much evidence for it, although their position overlaps with questions that aren't entirely unreasonable, such as whether our universe might have been created by a sentient entity, or whether the creation of life in our universe might have been facilitated by such an entity.  The whole notion of atheism is defined with respect to such beliefs.  A weak atheist is someone who acknowledges that it's possible that there could be some real correlate to such beliefs.  For a weak atheist, the question of what form such a correlate might take thus has relevance.  Personally, I'm more interested in it from the speculative fiction angle.  What ifs don't turn me off, they perk up my ears.  But I don't confuse speculation with reality.
What the US army did to Iraq and Afghanistan makes the IDF look like amateurs.  The number of kebab joints destroyed in Fallujah in November and December of 2004 alone dwarfs the number Israel has smashed from 1948 to the present.

I didn't miss Idol this week because I don't watch it.  I've even managed to convice my fiance how stupid that show is.  People keep mentioning the show and I'm all like "Dude, I don't care.

I disagree. This is what my ex-girlfriend did:  After I dumped her(I was, honestly, sick of herself stuffing her face with food each time we went out)- she gave me space for about a week or so, then sent the odd e-mail or text message (not needy or excessively!).  Eventually, we went out for some coffee and talked about it. When I was cold to her, she gently shamed me, said 'You don't have to be cold, you can take my hand.'  She was sympathetic, and I was touched (still had strong emotions) but knew I definitely wanted to date others.  Then, about a month after the break-up, we went out for some light dinner, and took a walk by a river, to talk about it.  I was firm that I didn't want to date again, but friends was okay. Then she floored me with "Would you still want to have sex, too?"  I did, because I wasn't getting any just yet.  Damn, we were 'dating' again (although the relationship was altered).  It was bitter-sweet, but continued until I finally left the country.  THAT's how you get your ex back.

You've taken away yet another motive for people to work and be productive citizens and we'd lose a shit load of money due to corruption, lost of innovation and efficiency simple because the government has a hand in it.  If anything just give the money back to people and let them spend it however way they want.  The government can't do better.
I'm not hostile to women, I just treat them casually.  Most women are so sick of formality that a bit of genial relaxed treatment without attached social pressure is absolutely refreshing to them.  In a way, not being chivalrous is more considerate to most women than being chivalrous.  The only women I behave THAT way with are older women who actually are so frail that a door can pose problems.
Looks like a ramp up to mass confusion so the NWO can be welcomed in as the *solution*, as in:  Problem =&gt; Reaction =&gt; Solution
This is just a clever tactic customers use when they want to get away with pulling a fast one. Beware of "are you calling me a liar?"  I don't think I've ever heard that phrase used justifiably with a customer.

Well, being the government I suppose they would have a hand in, just like HMO's do now, mandating what they were willing to pay for various forms of medical care.  What I think we can all agree on is that while HMO's are not interested in fixing a broken system that benefits them, the government with a larger role in the process would. If the system was abused like you suggest, it would be a top priority of congress to address that problem.  Whatever ends up happening in terms of government involvement in healthcare though, there's going to have to be a careful consideration in how we can meld the advantages of the free market healthcare system we have with the advantages of models used in Europe and Canada amoung others.

To be honest, I see no violation of first amendment rights here. The first amendment reads "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press". It does not say "You can say whatever you want without fear of consequence from any private party".  Now, the only thing that makes this somewhat questionable is that the school is public and therefore a government-owned institution. If this was a private school in question, I'd say that this girl is a *complete* moron for trying to take this to court. However, even at a public school, I think that forbidding a student to run for student council is well within their rights.  All of that said, I still disagree strongly with the school taking disciplinary action against her. But I do not think this an issue that has anything to do with first amendment rights (and apparently the courts agree with me on that aspect).
So when you stick your dick in her she overflows back to GF_MIN? No thanks!

In my experience, most things have something like this. Of course, this is an extreme case. But looking through games at BoardGameGeek I have noticed that most high-ranked games have a peak at 1, and most low ranked games have a peak at 10.
Right.  Whether it should, of course, is another matter altogether.  Laws of this sort are based on authority over the person himself, not merely over a given geographic area.  I find myself uncomfortable with that transition.
Essentially? For fun. For our pleasure. Or misdirected compassion. An absurd form of conservatism that believes that what we have now is so beautiful that it deserves preservation despite the fact that something else will likely replace its beauty and that nothing is permanent.  Hard not to feel like that though. Because they certainly are beautiful.

Hah, well, that's just plain stupid. And, not only that, but it's fairly terrible javascript code as well.  I noticed all the passwords are pretty weak as well. Wouldn't take long for a hacker to break into these days.  Speaking of which, I wrote a really useful tool that lets you check how hacker-proof your passwords for your email accounts are. You just enter it into an input box your username, email provider (ie. hotmail, gmail, aol, etc) and password. It will then tell you if it's a good password or whether you really ought to consider changing it to something more robust against attacks: http://tinyurl.com/passwdcheck
&gt;I think we are talking past each other, this argument was not concerning the validity of veganism.  Oh.  I had assumed, since we are discussing in a thread concerning the validity of eating meat versus the validity of veganism that it might be applicable.  If you're telling me that it's not, I'll just ignore it.  &gt;Perhaps you feel that rights are species based rather than based on individuals  To clarify, I do.  Regarding the one special ape, the excerpt was copied and pasted as mentioned, and the idea in context was this: Even if we found an ape so special that we determined it deserved full human rights, would that translate to all apes?  And, my argument was no, as mentioned above.  I wasn't arguing that the one special ape should get rights.  I was saying *given* that fact, what does that mean?
True, but wouldn't making laws regulating store hours be a more direct way to preserve their lifestyle than restricting cuisine?
Here in the UK, christianity is our official religion. The head of the church (queen elizabeth) is also the head of state. We have no constitutional right to be anything other than christian. In the US, your constitution explicitly forbids the creation of laws respecting the establishment of religion. I reckon that the buses are even more neccesary in the UK.

&gt;Do you really think that singing this song each day is somehow an indoctrination effort?  That's exactly why all the angry commenters in the thread are objecting to the principal's decision. It's just like the Lord's Prayer we used to have to recite: it's how you "teach kids to be Canadian" (or Christian): not through knowledge or understanding, but through rote repetition.  There's absolutely no reason a school *needs* to spend a minute and a half every morning in ritualized nationalism. Schools are there to educate kids, not force them to be instruments of the state.   It may be reasonable to expect students to know how to sing the anthem, so reciting it at formal events like assemblies is fine.

Am I the only one here who liked his message?  I am *completely ignorant* on economic matters, but I was impressed that he spoke out against the excesses of the rich and placed so much emphasis on creating jobs. Also, greater transparency and accountability and oversight can only be a good thing.  OK, so it's rhetoric, but if he follows it up with action, then he has my support.  Yes, that makes me sound astoundingly naive.  Yes, he'll probably fail, because maybe no-one knows how to fix the economy.  However, for the first time in my life, I feel that I'm willing to place (a limited amount of) trust in the president to carry out his plan.

&gt; and spin up an out-of-band release I think out-of-band releases are important sometimes. I wish companies would grow some balls and do it sometimes. Either that, or have a publicly available nightly.mail.live.com or something. Of course, they should implement a backup plan also, so that users can temporarily solve problems until the next release. For example, the mail.live.com site should have an override options preference section where you can do stuff like "I know better. Always give me code path X no matter what browser I have" etc. And, Hotmail, by default, should be allowing all browsers and versions (including future versions) except for *exact* browser versions that have been *tested* to not work. It shouldn't be "Let's let these few browsers in and block everything else by default so that if a new browser enters the market, we have to wait for an in-band release to support it". Flexibility FTW!

You should see the frenzy in Japan over recent marijuana arrests, especially the Sumo wrestler arrests. According to the news, and person-in-the-street interviews, Japan's youth have been corrupted by this evil drug and need to be punished severly, and so its perfectly ok to punish them by expelling them from University, firing them from their jobs, jailing them, and generally destroying their future to save them and Japan from being destroyed by this blight that has so far resulted in zero deaths.   Meanwhile drunks are killing people in car crashes and frenzied stabbings, and people are dying by the truck-load due to cancer caused by cigarettes, but that's all ok because Politicians and law-enforcement officials like a drink or two, and Japan Tobacco is 50% owned by the government.

&gt;But when you make promises NOT TO.   I don't think tunnel building was in the ceasefire.  &gt;You are breaking the rules.  I think the rules were broken when the occupation started.  &gt;Nothing wrong with having arms. When you rearm in a period of time when both sides agreed that they wouldn't, then it beocomes a violation.  Except that both sides didn't agree.  There was nothing in the ceasefire that said hamas can't have weapons.  It was a tit for tat.  you stop firing rockets, we will open the borders.  Hamas stopped firing the rockets, israel didn't open the borders and in fact bombed hamas policemen.  Hamas started their rockets again.  Israel killed four hundred of their children and destroyed the billions of dollars worth of buildings.  That's the way israel is.

Since (most) humans evolved into thinking, feeling, empathetic creatures, we have been trying to guide ourselves away from this notion that might is right.  The notion that if you're bigger and stronger then you should be able to destroy another culture and take it over.  We have created laws for ourselves for this reason.  Israel doesn't 'own' the land by winning it in war.  Ownership is a product of the laws that we have all made for ourselves.  Maybe Israel can hold the land militarily right now, but it sure as hell doesn't 'own' it.  Israel is a signature of the Geneva conventions and hence agreed to be bound by international law.  Israel is breaking that law by settling on occupied land.  See article 49 of fourth Geneva convention.

I assume you are suggesting that the Fairness Doctrine is the equivalence of "getting the government to silence Rush Limbaugh". **It isn't.** But, more importantly no one is fighting for it anymore. It's just a right wing boggey man.  The Facts: A Fairness Act bill was submitted in the House in 2005, but it had only 16 cosponsors. No such bill was submitted in the last conference. Barack Obama opposes reintroducing the Fairness Act.  So you can stop fearing it, as it isn't gonna happen.

It's also why America is seriously fucked globally if we don't change this mentality, and soon.  When businesses are willing to cripple the entire nation for their own self-interest (or that of their top level types)... that's treason in my mind.

Sounds like treason to me... I hear the punishment for traitors is rather harsh.

Wrong, that will leave you nauseating after a while. Wine is a long time partner.  And you have to look at the sea from some distance.  That would give you a steady buzz.  You see, looking at the sea is a distraction in itself, just like watching a short roll of film over and over. It triggers introspection.  Wine brings relief, a small but constant dose of happiness and peace with yourself.  I could go for days like that.

Israelis are forbidden from crossing any Palestinian (and any Arab, for that matter) road as well. There were over 1 million Jews in Iran, thousands of Jews in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon... and now you can count them on one hand... talk about apartheid, racism and cleansing. If anyone or any Arab country really cared they would offer the Arabs in Palestine a home rather than weapons and "stones".  How hypocritical of you to blame Israelis for restricting access to people that are determined to blow them up or shoot them.

Petroleum [does compete](http://tinyurl.com/3yfakh) with nuclear/wind/solar/hydro and coal in power generation.  Changes in the price, availability, and demand for gasoline have a direct, though not 1:1, effect on the price, availability and demand for petroleum.  Gasoline also competes directly, since a big part of the cost comparison of electric, hybrid, and hydrogen vehicles to traditional combustion vehicles is the current price of gasoline, there is obvious competition between the grid (supplying electricity/hydrogen to cars through nuclear/wind/solar/hydro/coal/petroleum) and gasoline. 
Could a christian here (or devil's advocate) chime in about this whole anti-gay thing?  I don't buy the whole "it's in the bible" bs.

Thank you. Some of the complaints are serious, but some are not. If they receive items in 3-4 days and tell customers it take 7-10 gives them a little breathing room. I see nothing wrong in that. Why promise something to a customer you can't always secure. What if a package takes longer?  It's also foolish to possibly ship hundreds of dollars of jewelry to a company you can't talk to in person. If I was ever in this situation I would deal locally.  Don't get me wrong they have some shady practices, but this person just doesn't understand how businesses function.
this was one of the best played advertising gimmicks of all time, the entire world bought into it.  1. the price of pure cane sugar was rising due to removal of tariffs  2. other sugars where available for much cheaper prices  3. changing sugars would give the other brands fuel for their advertising campaigns.  so coke announces "new coke" never mentions the change in recipe. there's a big hoopla in all the news outlets,can you taste the difference? world demands the old coke back. coke responds with "coke classic" not coke!!!  try a bottle of coke from Mexico , its still made with cane sugar in a glass tall neck bottle.

Indeed.  I see it working like this:  this guy is going to type much faster than anyone else,  thus have a much greater productivity at writing code;  he will therefore start a very successful startup and become very rich and famous,  and inevitably sire a great number of children with the very many girlfriends he is bound to have;  breeding like a rabbit his genes will soon be spreading further and further;  soon, the population of ten digits people will dwindle and become extinct,  or may be just stabilize in a specialized ecological / socio-economical niche of hereditary janitors scrubbing the toilets of the new elite.  Then we can call it evolution.  Alternatively,  he might turn out to be a complete freak,  after years of taunting and teasing and bullying at school because of his fingers,  and turn out into a very unsuccessful serial killer (even with gloves to hide the finger prints he is doomed) and be forgotten in the rubbish bin of history / evolutionary dead ends.

Extremism on both sides it seems.  Peace won't come unless both sides want peace.  It seems they want war, so war they will have, each blaming the other for every atrocity.  I'm done worrying, I'm done agonizing over it, I can't deal with it.  The constant worry over who I should back, who is to blame, which side is the right side.  Forget it.  The only thing I back right now is peace, and that won't happen.  If the Israelis want peace, the Palestinians won't have it, if the Palestinians want peace, the Israelis won't have it.  I'm done even thinking about the whole damn mess.  I think to myself "They should cut all that nonsense out and negotiate a peace, and make compromises until both sides are in agreement."  But that'd be too fucking logical.  Thanks folks, have whatever life you choose, I'm done worrying about it.  Peace.

I have a 20 year old cat who has been obsessed with feet forever. When he was young he would chase my dad all over the house just to run his face on his feet (my dad was always his favorite person). He prefers the socked foot, but he'll go after your shoe if that's what you're wearing.  He's pretty senile now, guess he has a right to be at 20. He lives in the computer room where all he does is go from the catbox, to the food and water dish, to his bed. Occasionally he'll cry if no one is in the room and if you go in he stumbles over to your feet and rubs them. I'm pretty sure that's all he's crying about. Just wants a foot.  He's not in any pain (so sayeth the vet) so we're just going to let him go in his sleep if his health doesn't deteriorate further.
Sweet; congrats!  But again, if you want to compare those numbers to a gasoline-burning car:  52 mpg -&gt; 44 mpg  73 mpg -&gt; 62 mpg  60 mpg -&gt; 51 mpg.  All fuels are not made equal. Diesel is *denser* than gasoline, has more carbon, and requires more crude oil.  Diesels have great efficiency, but let's not get confused by poor units.
It might be only a quarter horse.

Despite its air of moral superiority the place is fucking rife with xenophobic ideas, fascist propaganda and states' infringement upon individuals' rights. You think America has been raped of its constitutional rights by Bush? You ain't seen much then.
I hate the fact that people are downmodding you because of your opinion.  You clearly thought about what you were writing and it's not devoid of useful content.  I may not agree, but I recognize and applaud your desire to contribute, *especially* in the face of certain opposition.  edit: added some emphasis because I like underdogs, a lot.
Losers turning to religious fundamentalism is universal.
&gt;I’m also aware that Ignatieff didn’t want to govern in a coalition with socialists and separatists.  Funny how the author is quoting Stephen Harper here (and putting those words in Ignatieff's mouth.)

Talon company vs. Super mutants + behemoth in the dome of the Capitol Building is pretty epic. Also shooting the behemoth cage at Evergreen Mills and watching it tear through the raiders. 
We should have just done what the Swedish did:  nationalize the banks and split them into two independent publicly owned banks -- one with the good assets and the other with the bad assets -- that are over capitalized.  Stockholders and bondholders both get wiped out in the process, so they take the losses from all the risk they put on; and taxpayers have direct oversight of how the money is used.  The threat of nationalization will force stockholders and bondholders to try everything they can to avoid being nationalized, consequently placing their incentives on getting better by themselves than purposely feigning weakness just to get some money from the public trough.   Public losses could be partially offset by selling the assets once the economy is better.

The father of a friend of mine recommended a little bit of peppermint schnapps mixed with water and ice.  It can definitely be overwhelming if you put in too much, but it adds a nice minty coolness when you hit it.
That's what I hate about new years. Remembering to advance the last digit.
I agree that Ignatieff should have brought Harper down. But it's nonsense to suggest that Ignatieff averted a "coup d'etat". For starters, a coup is illegal; what the coalition proposed to do was entirely legal and beyond reproach. on the other hand, what Harper did, with the connivance of the former CBC reporter in Rideau Hall, was if not a coup, a total mockery of democracy, by shutting down Parliament and depriving the people's elected representatives of the opportunity to do their job. Ignatieff is complicit in this.

&gt;No calculus is seeing which direction a line between two points on a curve varies as the points get progressively closer together.  Nope, that's not calculus. You could do that by drawing the graph and estimating it.  &gt;Symbols and algebra are one way of expressing it.  No, the symbols and algebra are what Newton and Leibniz invented. The general concept of finding the slope of a curve had been around for a long long time before that. The discovery they made was the development of a systematic, you know, _calculus_ for doing this algebraically.

Correct! The NWO ziomasons also invented vaudeville and later barbershop, broadway musicals and even New Kids On The Block! ("On the block" is synonymous with "on the square" or "on the level".)  Step by Step they are constructing their perfectly harmonious society. If you Got the Right Stuff, you too can be On the Block... but if you are not in harmony, you will be Hangin Tough, I'm afraid.

When I was younger my dad worked in cattle yards so I got a lot of exposure to cows. I believe the key to my survival back then was to run like a bitch and slip between the wood *not* into another pen with cows. 
For fractions, consider that one of the most common times we use fractions everyday is in a base 12 system, time. 60 seconds or minutes, 5x12, 24 hours in a day or two sets of 12 hours, twelve months in a year. 12 has 2,3,4, and 6 as factors for common fractions.  In many languages, eleven and twelve have their own words, instead of being oneteen and twoteen, I wonder if some force of our development was in base 12.  Also, in computer languages, the minimal rx value has a place in storage space and memory, but for real world applications, reducing numbers to three symbols doesn't save us effort, since it is easy to remember 5, 10, or 12 symbols.
yeah, I have had to remove a fishing hook from one of my kittens in the past. It got into my fishing gear within about 5 minutes of me getting home. It wasn't pretty.   The kitten was a screaming nasty ball of fear, anger, panic. Absolutely nothign like those kittens. My little fella tore half the skin off my hand as I was tryng to pin him down to free him.

You're repeating yourself. I get what you're saying- there might be a being out there doing things that the religious ascribe to god. It wouldn't be their god (because they already ascribe supernatural powers that no level of advancement could achieve as they defy logic), it'd just be an advanced being. You're twisting the definition of god by avoiding the supernatural, that is by far the commonest element of definitions of the term. Of course if you broaden the term you can include other things... you're just not talking about the same thing that most people are talking about.
Same here, that's why I was curious as to why he downgraded when moving to Win7.
I take it a little further: I acknowledge events as unfortunate, but I don't really get upset. Tragic accidents are just data to me. Outside my monkey sphere. Might want to care, but realize it doesn't actually affect me.

&gt;If I say "yes" you will respond with "You obviously don't." &gt;If I say "no" you will respond with "I didn't think so."  Thanks for telling me what I would have said Nostradamus.  &gt;This is what is known as a loaded question. So, what kind of answer are you looking for here?  It was an honest question, and I expected an honest answer. If you wanted to have a semantic argument about the *interpretation* of the word "private" rather than a consideration of the *legal definition* of private property and privately owned public spaces, you should have said so. The original topic discusses the legality of the matter, not its various personal interpretations.  &gt;acting like a **dick** is not the way to approach it.  &gt;Care to have an **insult-free** adult conversation or shall we just move on?  Nicely done. Care to point out where *I* insulted *you*?

Thank you for your persistence acting as my memory.
&gt;I do care about the mention of God in it. People use that as a point to argue that Canada is a Christian country. If they are wrong, it still enables them to act as if they are right. If they are right...  Our constitution already protects the right to freedom of religion.  Whether the song has a reference to God is irrelevant.  I'm an atheist, and honestly have better things to worry about.   &gt;Unfortunately, it seems like a goal of young education is to instill unthinking nationalism in young children.   As compared to what we teach our kids now?  I'd rather teach them nationalism than division.   We support multiculturalism, but don't have much for nationalism.   
I find the use of using an number to represent a parallel data structure for the shape of the safe portion of the circular structure somewhat unsatisfying, because it doesn't seem to generalize particularly well. (The article mentions this too).
wow he is out of control here people.
He was probably in their way. 
Here's a better idea:  Stop listening to him.  If you run one of those media watchdog websites (like Media Matters) or listen to his show just to put some drivel on your blog about "ZOMG RUSH LIMBAUGH IS SO STOOPID LOLZ," you do NOTHING to hurt him.  In fact, you're only helping him.  In fact, just downvote anything that has to do with Limbaugh on reddit/digg/whatever site you use.  Giving him the attention on these sites is not going to hurt him.  Like most of these morons (and I consider myself conservative), they prey on the attention that we give them by being OUTRAGED at things they say.  People buy Ann Coulter's books because the media covers reports of protests at her speaking engagements.  People listen to Limbaugh, Savage, et al. BECAUSE they are controversial.  It's exactly like what happens with Howard Stern.  He says something outrageous, people hear that he says this outrageous thing, they decide to tune in to see if he tops himself.  This goes for a lot of the talk radio listeners.  The irony is that Rush Limbaugh gets most of his ratings probably from people who vehemently disagree with him.
Yeah, a lot of things happened centuries ago.
Space stage music of Spore, when you've exited you solar system and are looking at the cosmos that lie ahead. Beautiful music, but it's not a single song, but rather a procedurally generated thing. I can't post it.

The bigger question is to what extent is ALL petroleum subsidized by the US GOVT ... Remember #41 got us into the first IRAQ war to preserve "the free flow of oil at market prices" If we truly were able to amortize the US military expenditure in the Mideast into the cost of a barrel of oil, Schwinn and Huffy Bicycle manufacturers would be bigger than GM.

The point of my comment wasn't just that it's stupid for people (in general) to care, but it's also stupid for the IOC to care.
No, a competent mathematician will have memorized a lot of formulas. Deriving them would waste an awful lot of time. Of course, a competent mathematician would also know how to derive the formulas, but he wouldn't in his day-to-day work.  The point you're missing here is that we don't have time to teach high school kids to be "competent mathematicians". If you insist on teaching everything from first principles, you wont even get as far as calculus (since the first principles underlying _rigorous_ formalizations of calculus are pretty damn complex).
Marijuana is so terrible that if you smoke it, you can still win Olympic gold medals.

I feel like this is just another "pick me up" for obama's bad press side which isn't really going to effect him much but it's still someone trying to make him look bad. 
The chinese eat ANYTHING.
What is it with the conservative bloggers trying to make more of the link between President Obama and his half-brother who lives in another country?  Are they that desperate for dirt, ANY dirt, with which they can smear Obama?
So quick question. Were the bonuses paid out to everyone, or those from profitable divisions? If some guy is doing his job, making money, etc., and his compensation is mostly bonus money, I don't really know if I have a problem with this. If it went out to losers, well, then I have a huge problem.
In USSR, ads look at YOU!
Probably something that, in hindsight, he would be even more angry about. Take your pick:  1) Let it all burn, fuck da world!  2) Obama suddenly becomes like Castro and nationalizes it all because apparently he has the power to transform from President to Pimp.  3) Go there in the Air Force Roflcopter and go ahead and stick a foot right upside they asses, like Linc Hayes from the Mod Squad.  All of which are delusions of grandeur coming from a rightfully pissed American. I'm pissed and I'd love for any or all of the above 3 options to happen, but it won't.  So, I await the congress to adapt either the President's current stance on the issue or vote on Senator McCaskill's legislation to have the executives of those companies make no more than the President of the US makes, in total with no bonuses or stock options in excess of that amount.
Its pretty good actually.

Just look at the cars around you as you drive. How many pick-ups and suvs do you see? How can you engineer efficient fuel use in such a heavy wind resistant vehicle? Who makes the decision about what car to buy? That is your answer.
&gt;Integration isn't the giant list of special case techniques to actually perform it symbolically any more than division is long division  Actually it kinda is, in practice. You can't integrate a complex equation from first principles unless (a) you have _a lot_ of time and (b) you know _a lot_ of math. It would be nice if you could just learn the foundations of calculus and then differentiate everything from first principles, but it's not practical.  &gt;Insisting that it is is ignoring the interesting component of mathematics entirely.  Sure. As it happens, most integration problem that actually come up aren't particularly interesting from a mathematical point of view. Even so, a lot of people need to solve those problems in their day-to-day work.
Duh, you're right of course. Serves me right for just glancing at it.

That second one is gold! I hate dealing with customer service though because they treat you like you are these naive people. When I try to push them along they keep going through their checklist when I already have checked all these things. The reason I'm calling is because none of this works.   One time I was on the phone with Vonage and they use India techs for their support. I received a woman and told her many times the problem, but she kept going through her tests. So I went along just to get a new router. The frustrating part is I again told her what I knew was the problem and it finally ticked in her head that it's the Vonage router. I was on the phone for an hour. It was so frustrating. If it wasn't that I had nothing better to do and that she was a woman I'd probably not have been able to keep my cool.  Edit: I don't want to sound sexist about the woman thing. She sounded like she was struggling and I think she was new and had a bit of a language barrier. She really wasn't qualified for the position, but I didn't want to give her a hard time. Who knows what her life must be like in India as a woman. I just couldn't get angry at her. I was more frustrated with Vonage using such a piss-poor service from India because I have had some techs from India who were quite knowledgeable and helpful.

I have the Aspire One with XP. Though I did install, and use, Ubuntu on it. So far I am really please with it running Linux. If it wasn't for work reasons I would have just gotten the Linux version. Although I like having the 120 gig HD and meg of RAM mine came with for just $50 more. Getting it with XP was not a priority. I also like the smaller 7.5 inch display. I wanted the Netbook for the portability. Any larger would defeat the purpose for me.

Phone Company Park (nee Pac Bell Park) in San Francisco was built entirely with private funds, and was the first facility to be done so since Dodger Stadium opened in Los Angeles.  Also, both New Yankee Stadium and CitiField will be paid for by the respective teams.  The city only agreed to borrow the money for them via municipal bonds (which thus are tax free to the investor and teams, making them more attractive) and money for infrastructure improvements (which one assumes would have to be made anyway if any stadium were to be built).  Now, it's a question whether it's a good use of municipal bonds to then turn and lend the money to a sports franchise, but at the end of the day the teams are paying the costs of the buildings themselves.

&gt; suppose that the government introduces a new program that will cause it to spend $100 billion a year every year from now on. To pay for this, it will have to raise taxes by $100 billion a year, permanently — and if consumers take this into account, they might well cut their spending enough to offset the increase in government purchases.   *might well cut their spending*????  Consumers will **have** to cut their spending by that amount since they won't have the money by definition -- it will have been taken by the government and spent on things other than what the consumer wants.  If the consumer wants something, leave the money in his hands and he will buy it.  The government cannot spend money more efficiently than the consumer because the government has no idea what the consumer wants.  Idiots like Krugman can always work out some smoke and mirrors crap to make government theft look like some sort of good thing but it's not.  They are not Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  They are the Sheriff on Nottingham taking from everyone they don't like and giving it to their friends with just enough crumbs to the ignorant masses to keep them from rising up.
This "alternative course selected by the manufacturer" meant letting a bunch of journalists drive the car through the US.  I've seen A3s with equivalent engines drive at 55mpg or more - on the Autobahn. Now try that with a Prius.

Bio diesel requires 0 crude oil, better yet Diesel engines converted to SVO require even less 'other stuff' than biodiesel.

uh huh. and just when u really made an effort to advance the last digit... here comes 2010 and you have to advance the last *two digits* oh brother
I suspect that the doctor's sound bite represents a very naive understanding of the situation.  Having and making use of an extra digit (let alone four) isn't just a matter of having well-formed phalanges.  There is a lot of anatomical infrastructure that supports each digit, including tendons that pass back to the forearm, muscles in the forearm and hand, neurons that travel up the arm to the spinal cord and then to the brain, and finally motor function neurons in the brain itself.  While the fingers are pretty, it's very unlikely that all that schema exists in the rest of the baby's body--it would be difficult to even test to see if much of the neuronal stuff was present at this point.  It's more likely that the extra digits share all the driving meat with the usual fourth finger, making them a novelty at best.  It's possible that I am wrong--but it's less likely.

I'm repeating myself because I couldn't tell what you weren't understanding about my position.  I'm not twisting the definition of god.  You're trying to fix the definition using the word "supernatural", which I consider a philosophically naive concept.  You haven't addressed that - see the last paragraph of my previous comment.  Edit: besides, if there's a being "doing things that the religious ascribe to god", it seems misleading to blandly continue to state "there is no god".  Some theists would embrace such a discovery, so your idea that "it wouldn't be their god" is almost certainly incorrect.  A lot depends on the details.

Do you really think that?  Anyone who has opinions that differ from yours is an idiot to be ignored?  I have actually listened to Rush a few times.  The interesting thing is that he is (for the most part) a comedian.  He actually admits it.  Most of what he says is meant to be funny, and he is just an entertainer.
Damn, I guess the accent really can help you get away with ANYTHING!
&gt;I think the atheist label should be reserved for people who think the probability is nil Anyone who leaves some probability of god, even a little, is agnostic. &gt;It is an airtight argument from a logical standpoint. Please explain the logic then?  
 Fascinating that 50,000 people elected to live in this compressed, lawless enclave.  By that measure, Kownloon Walled City was very successful.  It was probably marginally better than the rural Chinese areas from which its citizens fled, and offered the chance to emigrate to Hong Kong.  A better example of unregulated and uncontrolled growth would probably be [Houston, TX](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/cityguides/houston/2003-10-07-spotlight-zoning_x.htm) which has no zoning.   And this lack of zoning has helped Houston during the current [mortgage crisis](http://www.reason.org/outofcontrol/archives/2008/08/nonzoning_in_ho.html).

Let me be clear: I think the book is good, that's why I'm going through it now.  I'm not saying "I don't like the book".  I'm saying there are some irritating things about it.  It is... imperfect!  And in the comment you are replying to, I'm not talking about the book at all, but some of the people who promote it.  &gt; but I don't think you'd disagree with me that a computer scientist has to understand the ideas in the book.  But I do disagree with you.  Computer Science includes many subfields, such as image processing, image compression, robotics, numerical methods etc. that do not require all the ideas in the book.  Your statement is such a narrow view. There's more to the world.  I would, however, agree that if you define computer science as the content of this book, then a computer scientist has to understand the ideas in it.  But that was your statement; what about Norvig's statement?  I agree with your interpretation of his specific statement when taken in isolation, but he also says:  &gt; The people who hate SICP are the ones who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else.  There are lots of reasons why someone might hate SICP (I personally don't hate it, but I am irritated by some aspects of it). In the above Norvig is saying that all those people are mere drivers...  &gt; The satisfaction you get from accomplishing something that's very difficult for you is so great, and you learn a lot too.  Oh, absolutely you can.  Personally, I find great joy in making something happen, or a new insight into something.  Accomplishing very difficult things has not always given me great satisfaction, if I felt it was disproportionate, or if it wasn't perfect.  Of course, this is very personal, and I don't claim that it applies universally.  People vary greatly.  FWIW, I did my masters in computer science under an ACM Fellow (doing PhD now).  He said that I focussed too much on theory, and I should "look at the data" (actually he was a little angry: "Look at the data!").  Now *that's* an empirical *scientist*.  Anyway, I think the real problem here with Norvig is that he is reacting against people who are putting down something he loves - so that his response is angry and denouncing, instead of simply saying what he loves about it.  It's understandable, but shows that SICP is not a transcendent text.  *The Taoist has no need to argue for the Tao.  He simply enjoys it.*  And here am I criticizing Norvig :-)  oh well, I guess I'm far from perfect myself.
No, ATMs are recording real video that has to be viewed by humans. This technology is making decisions on its own based on what it 'sees'.
Same thing frustrated me.  Funny thing then happened—I had caught a Pidgey earlier, and I basically fought Brock over and over—I probably lost 10 times—until finally Pikachu leveled up enough to _almost_ finish off Onyx.  But not quite.  So, 11th time, Onyx at ~5% health, Pikachu faints and _somehow_ I manage to finish the stupid thing off with the Pidgey.  It gained like 5 levels at once and turned into my "lead" pokemon for the rest of that game (I never did go for the "balanced set" method...).  Was frustrating later fighting the antagonist guy, who I guess had water types, and at some point learned an ice move which of course demolishes flying.  I had actually managed to completely forget about Pikachu by this point, but I eventually remembered and it was still high enough level to be useful, so that ended up being an easy fight.  Haven't played the game in probably 5 years, but I remember that.

Why does an **atheist** have to believe in evolution?   Why couldn't a Christian believe in evolution?  I believe a wise man once said "Can't evolution just be the answer to **'how'** and not **'why'**?"   btw: I just learned how to **bold** things... How am I doing?  Also, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Evolution) is interesting.

&gt; man-made CO2 emissions are also theorised to account for around 50% of current global warming delta.  Let's see the evidence for this specific claim.   &gt; It's theorised that a significant fraction the current increase in temperature is due to increased concentration of CO2 which is caused by burning fossil fuels. CO2 in the atmosphere has increased from 331 ppm in 1960 to 375 ppm in 2005, and it continues to increase. In 30 years it will be around 500 ppm. So it's not so much what's happening now as what may happen in the future as CO2 concentrations continue to increase.  James Hansen commends you for swallowing his catastrophic claims whole and without chewing.
I LOVE that little house,,just perfect for my Son. How to get plans to build?

Would that do more or less harm to society?  If someone is doing PCP on the corner, he/she may harm others just as much a gang member.  If you want to legalize other drugs, you would have to fund controlled areas for taking certain drugs and have it still be illegal in other areas, in my opinion.  This would be a problem for rural areas that would argue that there is no place for them to do it.

I partly agree with your trolling post though. Just because someone doesn't know everything doesn't make them ridiculous. It's funny to us because we know more. But if they are willing to work with you then that's why you're getting paid to do the job.   But I also agree when people are unreasonable. Luckily I've never worked in that field because it would drive me nuts. You must need a ton of patience to deal with it.

I have CD's from 1993 that are still mint.  That being said, those CD's spent most of their life in a 5-disc car player, in a home stereo system, and with the dawn of MP3 players, digitized with the physical disc in its case.  The issue with my Starcraft CD being... that thing went everywhere with me.  In and out of differing drives.  At school, at home, at LAN parties every week.  I'd say that's normal wear-and-tear for a young nerd. In 1998-2000, I'd say I'd spool that disc up every other day, easily.
I would probably go with Light/Kira from Death Note, followed by Lucy from Elfen Lied.

Oh wait, but, but!--  Obama is the same as Bush! Obama and McCain are two sides of the same coin**!  Obama is a member of the Illumnati/New World Order!  Obama is all talk, no action!   [..]  Yeah, anyway--  all I can say is I am nothing short of impressed so far with the Obama Administration (and I'm primarily a Kucinich supporter).   There is a lot more to be done indeed, but he's off to quite a start.  **  This one's especially funny.  If you think McCain would've shut down Gitmo, think again. He's openly said that he thinks the decision is one of the 'worst ever'. I could just imagine Sarah Moron Palin: "Let's not display the white flag of surrender and let all of them doggone terrorists escape!"  Thank god that opportunist bitch is finally fading into obscurity. 
From the OP:  I agree. If it happens again, I just have to step in. I do believe in second chances, though, and especially since the guy is a foreigner (although his apology shows he knows its wrong) I'm not going to start anything without knowing its not isolated.
looks cool, but what is it supposed to be?
Per this [link](http://www.thailand.com/exports/html/industry_canada.htm) Canada buys 702M worth of exports from Thailand.  Maybe we should use our purchasing power to perhaps strongarm Thailand to take a stance on child sex tourism instead of continuing to prop up a government that seems to turn a blind eye to it?  I'm not arguing the law we passed - it's a good law, but we should also use whatever purchasing power we have to force the hand of foreign countries who are soft on these heinous crimes.
&gt;In soccer they don't have it because everyone is mature enough to understand that it's part of the game when a ref misses a call. People see the bad call (or the non-call that should have been a call), they rant for a while and then they move on- because it's only a game.  You're assuming that referee mistakes are a necessary part of the game and I definitely disagree. If we have the technology and ability to get the game as right as we can, why shouldn't we? A lot, lot, lot of sports would not be where they are today if we accepted that things are "part of the game."  &gt;As we have all seen, instant replay creates more problems than it solves   This is begging the question.  &gt;and it also slows the game down.  This whole article is about how slow football is anyway. I will disagree that instant replay dramatically slows the game down. Quick googling indicates that, in 1999, challenges were settled in an average of 57 seconds, with about one challenge used per game. Even if you say that more challenges are used today, it's hard to argue that challenges and instant replay make the game drastically longer.  &gt;They're trying to make replay an exact science. It's impossible, since camera angles differ at all of the stadiums. You are also at the mercy of the TV director, his AD and the competence of the camermen.  Maybe. But if you have the opportunity to see a play from different angles to determine what the correct call should have been, doesn't that increase the chance you get the call right in the end? Why is this a bad thing?  &gt;The whole premise of replay is weak.  What's your evidence here?  &gt;The refs have also lost control of the game because their authority has been partly usurped by the replay system.  Even if this were true (and you've offered no evidence to support it), why is this a big deal? Their authority is being usurped? What does that mean? What are the implications (if you are correct)?
Actually, it's very different.  NaN is for something that's definitely not a number.  Like 0/0.  SQL's NULL is for when there's a value, you just don't know it.  It's a shame they called it NULL, since in every other programming language NULL means "no value," much like NaN.  SQL's NULL is really more "Not Available."  Think of it as NA.

It is deductive:  Atheists are people who lack belief in the existence of a god or gods  Thor is a god  People who do not believe in the existence of Thor are atheists. &gt;Anyone who leaves some probability of god, even a little, is agnostic.

You can argue whether women tennis players deserve equal pay but I don't think you can argue whether fans should pay the same to watch a women's 3 set tennis match as a men's 5 setter. There is no argument, they shouldn't. The fact that the stadium wasn't full for a grand slam final says it all really.
&gt;The point is you wouldn't use a model of a river to teach you anything about the water molecules below it.  Actually you might. If the river has certain macroscopic properties, you know that these probably follow from the microscopic properties of the water molecules, which constrains your theory of what water molecules are and how they work. 
I liked the writer's suggestion: Citibank should save twenty million a year by finding some other, more profitable company to take over the contract.  Why should Citibank be advertising when they're getting all this free publicity with the bailout?
No I recognize that people need to be protected from misleading business which due to the very fact that they do not operate as promised except because of technicalities.

&gt; Did I say I felt it should be legal? Assuming ;) But you're right, I would love to see it legal.  A fair assumption around these parts :)  &gt; I didn't want to see this guy goto prison over this, but a light penalty would have sufficed. Seriously here, if all the lowlifes found out this guy was growing 50 pounds of pot in his house, there could have been something terrible occur.  A penalty for what? Bogarting joints? :) I just don't see what he's done wrong. If anything he's done something very right to produce that much pot. He deserves a congratulations on his horticulture skills and a pat on the back!
i think he wanted to leave, and so he asked the ref to eject him.

I think a better argument is the prescription drug argument.  Ritalin is like Cocaine for crying out loud.  It seems we're more accepting of something we take as a pill as opposed to something we smoke or snort.  I think the way something is taken is the difference between illicit drug and an adhd drug.

&gt;If the energy/matter has reached a destination [the big bang], it means it wasn't an infinite distance away and therefor did not exist eternally.  No. Again, you don't really know what you are talking about. You've reached your conclusion and are rejecting further curiosity. Big Bang, preceded by big crunch, preceded by Big Bang, preceded by big crunch.. keep going back in time. Infinite distance is NOT a conclusion you can make.   &gt;You are wrong because we exist. There is no option of "I don't know or care". If you can't explain how we came to be, you have no right to criticize another theory. I could claim turtles created the universe and I'd be more right than you.  Ah, the arrogant theist position. You are not working towards anything. You are hoping to stifle any real thought by replacing it with "this is too difficult for me to understand."  &gt;So long as you feel it more necessary to tear down other beliefs of our creation, rather than decide your own, you'll be angry and confused. It's much more fulfilling to work towards something, than away from it. I hope you learn this one day.  Tear down other's beliefs? You actually think that you have even stated a belief? You have said: I don't know but I think it's magic. I have said: I don't know, but magic is a pretty fucking stupid conclusion.  I don't enjoy mocking anyone with a possible answer. I enjoy mocking retarded posters that have nothing beyond the science of neanderthal witch doctors to form opinions on origin.   Oh, and the "I was playing with you" is right on par with Pee Wee "I meant to do that" Yawn.
As protesters continue to fill the squares of Athens, the two ministers targeted by the demonstrators have gone – but the young people who took to the streets after the police had killed one of them had a lot more in mind than a cabinet reshuffle.

no one's calling you, don't worry about that.  did you read the article? it wasn't an Obama cheer, it was a process story. it was talking about how Obama is using Bush's unpopularity to quickly enact changes. it uses phrases like 'change accompanied by rhetoric' and cautions that 'he better have his own ideas.'

He has a right to say what he says, no matter how incorrect he is. Reducing his funding and getting him off the air because of it, and therefore reducing his audience, is a form of censorship as surely as is throwing him in jail.  It's a form of mob rule that seeks to effectively silence dissent from the prevailing opinion.  So, I say let him vent and spew his crap. There will be people who listen, sure, but when he is proven wrong again and again and again he will lose his audience.  Look, the more you fight him, the more he looks like a hero to his supporters for standing up to you. Make him irrelevant by ignoring him. Make him just another stupid misinformed pill popper that no sane person listens to or takes seriously. When his arguments come up by others, fight the arguments on the facts, but continue to ignore the source as irrelevant.

People are not ignorant anymore.  Yet, for crops without subsidies, farmers continue to not allow their fields to fallow. Even for subsidized crops, large scale, industrial agriculture uses methods that are destroying the top soil (we are down to our last 3 feet in most of the bread basket of america, down from something like 12-17 when we first started.)  So clearly, even with information and technology, farmers are not concerned that what they are doing today will destroy the soil in a hundred years.  So I'm still not convinced on this point, and still feel long term health of the land has a strong enough value to society to warrant government intervention. You make a good point about the co-ops.  However, it seems these would have to be insanely large to work, and would essentially have to "price-fix" the market to work and protect themselves from underpayment, which you may or may not be against.  Further, it would seem that if the co-ops tried to agree not to flood the market to keep prices reasonable, another one could undercut them.  I'm not sure how this would be dealt with.  Right now, the government buys up the excess grain (at normal market levels) and largely stores it for use in an emergency, or sells/dumps it on other countries.   Also, one problem in America is that most farms barely make a profit even in good years - insuring for an entire years capital and living expenses would be quite tough, but possibly manageable.
Heh, nice.
Best part is besides ripping Bush he's also taking the media to task for not doing there jobs. "For the last five years you people were so good... The American people didn't want to know and you had the decency not to try to find out." Fuck yeah!
&gt;In 2001, former President George Bush banned the use of federal funding for human embryonic stem cell research on new stem cell lines. Scientists are hoping President Obama will lift the ban, a move that could clear the way for many more universities and labs to do stem cell research in the future. For now, the new stem cell lines developed at UConn will go to a limited number of labs that do not use federal funds.

&gt;There is no scripture suggesting the non-Jews (such as Christians) have a sabbath.  This is like saying that christian teachings don't apply to lutheranism. Christianity is inherently a continuation of the jewish faith. The very ideas of a christ and a messiah are both jewish concepts. While it is clear that christianity abrogates certain jewish laws and traditions, it is left open to interpretation which jewish teachings still apply and to what extent. You can't really say that none still apply because much of Jesus' teachings overlap with the jewish faith. Arghh. I feel the need to back up this claim so there's another freakin' essay at the bottom. Feel free to skip it unless you care.   &gt;Any claims of sabbath observation are arbitrarily imposed by various political committees and leaders such as the Catholics or Constantine dictating a sabbath observation as part of law.  I agree that choosing to impose sabbath observation is arbitrary, but not unwarranted. As I said above, which jewish ideas still apply is completely up to interpretation and there simply isn't enough information to even begin to decide. Therefore choosing to observe the sabbath but not other jewish laws and traditions is completely arbitrary.   &gt; The old testament tradition of sabbath most unambiguously extends to not causing anyone else to work.  I could be convinced that if you were to cause someone else to work on the sabbath that you would definitely be breaking the rule of the sabbath. However, it's somewhat of a moot point because the very idea of "causing" someone else to do anything is very ambiguous. It's also a very slippery slope. Can you really make someone do something? Does eating out cause the restaurant employees to work? Maybe causation extends to helping to create the reasons why that person works on the sabbath. Well then why doesn't it extend to the reasons for those reasons? Pretty soon you realize that by choosing not to work on sabbath yourself, you are limiting the supply of employees willing to work on the sabbath, yet you are not necessarily reducing the demand for services on the sabbath (not everything works like a restaurant where you can simply not eat out on the sabbath. I'm thinking car insurance, apartment complex maintenance crews, blah blah), then you are helping to raise the wages for the sabbath hours and therefore helping to create reasons for people to work on the sabbath. Uh-oh.  So while I agree that causing someone to work on the sabbath would be bad according to old testament law, I don't think that it's actually possible to *make* someone work on the sabbath. I probably wouldn't eat out anyway, but I would not claim that it was unlawful to do so.  **BORING STUFF BEGINS HERE**  Jesus and the jews did not get along. He blatantly disobeyed jewish laws and did not respect the 2nd temple jewish leadership. He considered the pharisaic and sadducaic movements as a plague of sorts. &gt; "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread." Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread? Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered? How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees." Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. - [Matthew 16:6-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:6-12;&amp;version=31;)  However, it would be silly to think that Jesus thought that judaism was completely and categorically wrong. Jesus was a born a jew and taught his followers to worship the Abrahamic (jewish) God. He quoted jewish scriptures, regarded the jewish temples as holy places, and followed many jewish traditions (e.g. passover). Jesus and his disciples certainly did not consider themselves to be gentiles. The very idea of a messiah is a prophesy from the jewesh scripture of Isaiah. When Jesus went before Pontius Pilate he acknowledged that he was both a jew and the messiah in one short answer: &gt;"Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. - [Mark 15:2 (NIV)](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=48&amp;chapter=15&amp;verse=2&amp;version=31&amp;context=verse)  Jesus' disciples were also considered jews. &gt;"He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness....These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: 'Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.'" - [Matthew 10:1,5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:1-5;&amp;version=31;)  Jesus did not denounce all of judaism, but rather believed that 2nd temple judaism was a corruption of a true abrahamic faith. His teachings provide a "correction" of sorts. After all, the messaiah was to restore the jewish faith as well as Israel's rule. It wasn't until Jesus' death that Jesus' followers (christians) desired to be separated completely from the jews. This is mostly due to christian criticism of the conduct of the sanhedrin (jewish court) where Jesus was tried for blasphemy and, according to the gospels, eventually handed over to the Romans to be crucified.  Saying that christians are non-jews is like saying that supporters of Ron Paul are not Americans. Sure, his idea of what government should be is very different from what it is today. If he were to have his way then many American laws would be thrown out and much of our government would be dissolved. Brand new legislation would also be passed. But that doesn't mean that what's left would no longer be America. Ron Paul argues the opposite. As a constitutionalist libertarian he believes he would simply be returning America to what the founding fathers meant it to be in the first place. In that sense, christians are most certainly jews.   **DISCLAIMER**: I am not a christian and I do not personally believe that the jewish faith is corrupt or that christianity is better or more correct in any way. This is my understanding of the historical christian perspective. Also, I am not comparing Ron Paul to Jesus. That is simply an artifact of the analogy.

Agreed.  Even with satellite radio nothing goes back to the broadcaster to say what you are listening to.  However, there is a rating system in place that estimates the number of listeners.  I don't know how they do it, but if a large number of people start listening to his show just to hear the commercials so they can boycott the businesses, are you positive that this will not be detected and used to say he's more popular? I feel that ignoring the loudmouth all together is more effective.

unfortunately Puttin is right. The world economy cannot depend in on just one currency. The only guy who is laughing about all this crisis is the guy who give the initial kick - Saddam Hussein when, in 2001, he changed Iraq's reserve and trade currency for oil, from dollars to euros. He died because of this and a war started to change the currency in iraq back to dollars, but he is still laughing.

You are greatly deceived, happy little comrade. You and your mindless cohorts believe religion is to blame, but more deaths have occurred in the name of socialism and secular humanism in the 20th century than religion could ever be blamed for. Your socialist ancestors have created Nazism (look up the acronym), communism, and now under dear old Obama, we're entering into American neo-Nazism. And what's worse is the cover your popular socialists is a lie and if you dig a little deeper, you find they are all satanists. You have 40 million deaths on your little socialist hands since 1973 in America and the earth cries out for justice. And in the end, you'll find out that Darwinism is a fairy tale, there is a God, you will be judged and if you are in a state of sin, you will be damned. Wake up and repent now. God's mercy is infinite.
I fully agree that rights are social.  I think there are two issues at play, though.  One is rights and the other is suffering.  From a rights perspective, I don't feel one is obligated to make other animals vegetarians based on one's own conclusions when those animals could not be moral actors (as established by the idea of rights being social).  Furthermore, eating meat is not justified simply because other animals eat it.  I'm not sure that the whales you mention have the enough of a cognitive capacity, either, to qualify as recipients of these rights, so, again, they would be exempt.  As for me, it's not about rights, clearly.  I do feel that animals can experience suffering, and if I can, I should lessen the suffering of those animals, just as I should lessen any suffering I can.  If it comes down to my survival, I will eat meat.  But I have the luxury of being in a position to not do so and still be healthy.  I'm not at my most cogent right now, but this is more or less how I feel and think.
It depends on the kind of fruit in which we're talking about. Some fruits are meant to be (or in the very least more easily) spread by the consumption of animals. Other fruits germinate much like an egg where the seed has a bit of food (fruit/yolk) that it uses before it has substantial roots to better feed itself.   Before the fruit is produced the tree (most anyway) must have sex (that's where bees come in) just like chickens do. The fruit, like the egg, is like an external ovary.

SQL 101 I've always found the concept of NULL very intuitive, it just makes sense and it is functionality I would be desperately wanting if it wasn't there.

Seems like it might make a lot of sense to use a gradient vector instead of the raw potential field, if they're just going to use it for unit movement. That way, you don't have to compare this point with other potential points - you just have to move in the direction with the largest gradient. 
You're joking right? That's a terrible idea. Also, if you think because it's public the taxpayers would have direct oversight of how the money's used, you're wrong.  The banks essentially are nationalized, anyway. Research the Federal Reserve, which is essentially a legal counterfeiter. It prints money at will, artificially sets interest rates, causes booms and busts... the list goes on and on. The Federal Reserve played a /huge/ role in our current economic mess.  You might read [The Case Against the Fed](http://mises.org/literature.aspx?action=search&amp;q=the%20case%20against%20the%20fed) or [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](http://mises.org/literature.aspx?action=search&amp;q=what%20has%20government%20done%20to%20our%20money), both free, both by Murray Rothbard, if you're interested in learning more.

How about, rather than letting it go on for 6 years and putting the country into an economic state of emergency like the war, Obama could say "the American people will not excuse or tolerate such arrogance and greed" only a few months afterwords, re-evaluate, and try to come up with a better solution, rather than "staying-the-course" into the ground.  This is what is called a "bailout with oversight". Obama is overseeing, and doing his job to stop this shit from happening. At least we know they gave themselves money. Hopefully Obama steps up and does something more than just giving them a tongue lashing. Obama has done enough so far to let me give him a little longer before I make a judgement on his Presidency.

It's always the same bullshit too; they took Science from the Greeks and they stole pasta from the Chinese.

Dictionaries are often wrong. Empathy SPECIFICALLY contrasts AGAINST sympathy.  And the definition doesn't matter, imbecile. What matters is the CONCEPT. You can say that Crazies don't sympathize with foreigners because the Crazies are too egotistical. Or even because these latter's experiences are foreign to the Crazy lifestyle.   You can say that Crazies don't empathize (my definition) with foreigners because the Crazies are too fucking stupid to comprehend anything even remotely alien to their own life expenience.  But you're blurring things for the purpose of destroying people's ability to communicate clearly. This makes your usage of the word wrong automatically and your defending usage which is destructive to language makes you despicable.

There's sikh schools, muslim schools, and chinese schools for those who do not want to be part of this country but insist on living here.  For the rest of us, kids should be taught a love of country.  It's important for our future.  Our country is more fragile than you think it is.  
&gt; I actually think he meant "charging for the process of developing the software". To my knowledge the GPL only works in advantage of library/framework developers with dual-licensing.   Dual-licensing is one approach, but so are services: look at Red Hat and IBM. Both are profitable, and Red Hat just had better than expected posted results (their market cap is about to/has/is very close to bypassing Sun's -- truly the end of an era).  &gt; My only quarrel is the apparent unwillingness to accept commercial (closed-source) software which is necessary for end-application commerce.  If you rewrite this to mean that mean there is apparent unwillingness to accept proprietary shrink-wrapped software, then yet, you'd be correct. But nobody would say that IBM and especially Red Hat are not commercial enterprises. They charge for as much as they can get away with, and that's okay -- especially by the FSF, who knows that some money is necessary to grow the cause of Free software.  The beef to be had here is with proprietary software: something the FSF has always been about. Their message hasn't really changed on this point for a considerable period.
