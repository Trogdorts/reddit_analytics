**Power Play: What are the advantages of Preparing a System that is closer rather than farther from the HQ?**  
I just read it, and it basically goes that he's fighting Luke/Leia in front of Palpatine, Luke "disarms" him, (get it?!? :D) and then Vader refuses to fight anymore. Meanwhile, the second Death Star is exploding around them and they refuse to leave Vader/Anakin behind. Palpatine escapes in the confusion and they make a speedy getaway in the Falcon, where currently-hibernation-sickened and blind Han has a WTF moment when he hears a certain asthmatic Sith Lord get on board. Then we cut to a rebel command ship and light side Vader walks in! 
Well put.

Counting Calories doesn't actually help you keep track of nutrients.
I have said this from the beginning. They should have just invented some new teams along with some bug fixes and community features. They could have sold it as DLC.  Launching a new engine so soon after the original rejuvenates the game at first, but then slowly kills it. There is no way veterans will choose this as the platform for their private leagues, and that is the heart of what keeps the game and its community going.

It's pretty much the same movie but without the castration plot. "I'm not a girl" is more about being a monster than...yeah. I didn't care for the shot of a castration scar set to the tune of a weird and wacky song anyways so I tend to prefer the american version.   Both are great for basically the same reasons though.

Intelligence is extremely hard to define.  There are measurable aspects of your brain function, though, and there is a very strong correlation between really good memory and really good other things (like processing speed or problem solving or spatial awareness or whatever).  So what's he's saying isn't so much that memory means intelligence, but more that having an insanely good memory suggests his brain is very good in other measurable ways
Oh definitely, I only mentioned it because it goes into first-person view and a casual viewer looking at gameplay footage might be confused.
They don't all have a horrid fan.  I bought 3 of them.  The first I opened could be heard from 20 feet away, in another room, around the corner.  The second is silent unless you're within inches of it.  I haven't opened the third yet.

My boss smokes cigs, when he tried my TFV4 he inhaled real slow for an MtL. He burned the coil and dry hit because there wasn't enough airflow for the wattage it was set at. "Dude, what the fuck are you smoking?!" He said through watery eyes. I turned the wattage down and then he said it tasted like lemon cookies. And he blew beautiful smoke rings with it.

I think it's really well made from what I've played so far. Granted I have played less than 20 hours of multiplayer, I've liked what I've played.  Arena feels good (albeit a bit sparse) and Warzone is a very cool addition.  Despite that, I'm just not sure Halo is the multiplayer series for me anymore.  I'm not trying to down it, I just don't see the multiplayer having that much sticking power with me.  While I said Arena feels nice, I am pretty sure it won't hold me for long. I love the idea of Warzone, but the maps are a bit sparse, I'm not a huge fan of how the cards work (although I can't really think of a better/equivalent alternative given how the mode is setup) and I only have a really great time when I have a small group of friends I'm with.  I'm not saying the multiplayer is bad, I'm saying it's quite good but I'm not sure it has hooked me in the ways that Halo did back in 2007.
Don't be ridiculous. We aren't losing these games because we don't know how to close out. We are losing these games because of youth. They will start coming our way. Don't be so quick to lose your positivity!

Well that's completely bizarre. The only other "Dark" Pokemon are Primal Dialga (called Dark Dialga in Japan), XD-001, and Shadow Pokemon. But all other examples run counter to the idea of a Mega - they require such trauma that the heart shuts closed, except in Dialga's case (only Dark one outside of the Orre games) where it instead requires time itself to completely stop which drives him batshit

Hero stacking sounds fun! Blizzard just needs to make sure that there are hard counters for every class. So 6x any heroes can't be meta. If you can always counter other team there are no need to limit heroes.  Make change to windowmakers ult so when it's used it also reveal WM who used it and every other Widowmaker. That way you know  wallhack is on and wm is easier to kill. This would balance out ult + double WM (if needed)
no it doesnt. you can just run the easy lev 28

that was one thing i hated about fallout 3. Everything had a green tinge too it. I really like fallout new vegas way better than 3 mainly because in new vegas it was easier to get side quests in my opinion.

If you think maelstrom is the best/ going to be the best build for aquas, something is wrong with you lol. Tetras are stronger then mael same with ripple rush in this meta. And this is coming from someone who currently plays mael. The new tetra combos are insane as is the ripple g2 shenanigans. Mael is still countered by keeping them at 4
I'm starting to feel the same way, lol. I've started sterilizing the plastic bases and uses them for alternative things; such as sucking out the occasional pimple, blackhead, or ingrown hair.

Ah. I forgot about the veritas saws. Perhaps it would be better for him to go with either the dozuki OR the veritas and the 4-pack of narex chisels. At just over $100 spent, he'd have a lot left for a craigslist/ebay no. 4 stanley, a marking guage, then some EZ-LAP diamond plates for sharpening.
I had considered that. But I've been trying to learn Python, so I figured I'd do it with Python.  Thanks for posting the bash script, though. I would like to learn more about bash scripting, and that makes it clear how succinct it can be.

I had the same issue recently. I submitted a support ticket and CCP fixed it within a few hours.  They said it was caused by the blood raider boosters causing an inconsistency in the skill system that prevents some players logging in.  The fix is them clearing your entire skill queue. Your skills will train right up until they do though, and I got gifted 3 days of SP as compensation for not being able to login.

May not need to replace facetime, point is it's full sized, like a massive screen, and your friend appears to sit in front of you, full sized, eating food with you. It was a random idea.

For starters, it doesn't support iPhone 6/6s natively, but rather scales it up.  But the core problems remain the same. I'm constantly waiting for the app. When I first launch the app, I get a please wait screen. When I tell it to turn on climate control, please wait while the request is sent.  It is very poorly designed and does not take advantage of any background processing. It should take only a few seconds to launch the app and request climate control. Confirmation should be happening with a push notification.

Good point. Right now flare is the only counter (which is stupid to have to run for one deck encounter). Increase its cost to 7-9 would help the opponent but may slow paladin deck down too much.

Most modern players don't do 3d6 in order.  A few do 4d6 drop one, or point buy because they are terrified of overpowered or underpowered characters.  They want "optimized" characters.  Also, AD&amp;D is far less forgiving than PF or 5e
It's not the size that counts, its how you use it ;)  Our brewery has been pieced together as it grew. We have 50hL, 75 hL, 150hL and 175hL tanks. Then all the way down to a 10hL, which is the smallest amount we can boil for one offs.  Itll be nice after our expansion to have all the same tanks. Working with multiple sizes is rough. Our production manager frequently just stares at the schedule and mutters to himself.
Thanks, I got it for my birthday!
When I delivered that fee never went to the driver. I'm actually not sure what the hell it is for. 
&gt;It's a style that requires all 10 outfield players to think in the same wavelength and requires them to think more rather than just rely on instinct.  There are many styles that can get players playing on the same wavelength. This is just bullshit that sounds good but means nothing in reality.   &gt;Some players flourish in it others don't. Player y needs to know where player x likes to make his runs ,needs to understand whether he likes to do 1-2 or a through ball after he runs in behind.  Again, why are we spending hundreds of millions of pounds on players just so they can fit the system? If the the philosophy is so good, why the hell do we need to spend so much money?

This is a textbook example of why the phrase "Don't shit where you eat" exists.  You can't escape your family if this goes south, as if it wouldn't be bad enough because many people will still view this as incest and you preying on teenage girls. Not worth it at all, and sleeping with her wouldn't be as good as a more experienced woman anyway.
That's the beauty of the game, it makes fish go bonkers. 
Just did my first game on FUMBBL, and I'm not really agreeing. (I may have missed some parts of the UI, but then again, the point of a clean/well though of UI is to help everyone, especially newcomers)  The "find game" sequence is maybe worse than the other games, a bit less click than BB:CE, but then you have to go from the website to a java applet downloaded. (it generated a "custom" one for this match, but I guess I can launch from this same afterwards? ) not a huge deal, but still a chore to have to jump between web and java.  The layout in game is clear and presents all important info on the screen, much clearly than BB:CE. Though on my screen the window was a bit too big, with no apparent way to resize it, had to move the taskbar.  When playing, I still think BB2 has a better presentation, and more forgiving/enjoyable controls. When you pick an unit you can clearly see where it can move, when you blitz you can see how much dice you'll roll, and you can see the tackle zones clearly, even if it was done better in BB:CE.  On the other hand the game log is near perfect.  So yeah, it's clear, and I feared worse, but I wouldn't say it's the best, at least not "by far".

Try a used game store, they probably have some copies of year 1 destiny. They'll probably be cheap too since the current disc includes all DLC.

I however did not find the other ends of those cables that are shown in that picture, I will check them tomorrow and get back to you with the numbers from the tests. And I will probably replace the switch tomorrow as well.  Sorry for being such a pain with all of this, and thank you so much for trying to help me.

Hehe, I can only say: Welcome to the game my friend. You have much to learn and to experience.  For your current problem, I strongly suggest using power priorites. To do that (with keyboard): Press 4, then q and e to navigate to the "Modules"-tab. There you can play around with your priorities. You can put your FSD Interdictor to group 5 (least used group) and then even install your shield generator on group 2 (or 1, whatever). The FSD indictor will (due to power shortage) only deactivate, if you deploy your weapons. But because you can only deploy your weapons outside of supercruise and the FSD-I is supercruise only, you wont get into trouble. I currently fly all my ships on something like 115% powerusage - possible with smart power priorities. Have fun!

&gt; clouds of hydrogen, i'm guessing would not have a particularly impressive phi.  Probably not, but even an elementary particle might conceivably have some internal communications going on between its constituent fundamental parts (e.g [proton and its quarks](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-theory-of-consciousness/?page=3)).

It could also be the idea to avoid evidence that does not fit your conclusions.  For example, I could find no court order for Adnan's complete phone records.  The incoming call data would have been useful.

Don't want to put down too much but I think you have that number wrong, leaving aside any networking constraints the average PC (or even ones specifically above average) would likely be unable to handle that many players in a single instance (as said by CR himself). Whilst they would love the numbers to be that high they are unlikely to be due to basic PC limitations, especially given the crazy high fidelity of the ships.   That's not to say there won't be more than 240 players at large (all players will be in the same universe come release) you just won't likely ever see more than 100 at the same time! (Would love to be wrong though!)

Yes it's worth it.  Start a trial account, do the tutorial missions to learn how some of the very basic stuff works and then join a newbro friendly corp ASAP. (srsly, don't start hanging around in highsec mining/running L1 missions alone - you'd miss out on everything that makes Eve great)  If you decide that you like the game just upgrade to a full account - you'll keep everything.
When we live in a world where nearly all rapists are female and nearly all rape victims are male, and in general females are responsible for nearly all murder and other forms of assault on males, then yes, we should start jailing women for exposing themselves to unwilling male victims. 
Seems standard practise to feel out a castle and draw those troops away to kill with regular troops before proceeding though.

Because both genders are their own character. To do that, you'd need two more voice actors to do "Gay Wife" and "Lesbian Husband" acting for all of the lines Nora or Howard (Nora is apparently the Default name for the Female PC and I'm using Howard as default for the Male PC) say when you aren't playing them, minimum. More importantly, it violates the assumed logic as to why swapping genders actually changes who you play as rather than just the model, which was likely core to the entire idea behind the tutorial being as much a demo of the gameplay as it was a demo of the pre-war world, and itself informed from having a fully voiced protagonist.  This is something that has a lot of interconnectedness and layers to this that make it hard to just "hit a button" to change. They certainly could do so, and the fact that they made a choice not to says something; after all the artist has the power to make their art anything they want to show, but they chose to have the restrictions they did for a reason.

An interesting read, for sure, though I was personally a bit disappointed at how focused it was on the multiplayer aspects without any focus on the Campaign element at all.  Being said, I am probably as much an anomaly as they come for the Halo series. I was 14 when Halo 2 came out. I've been playing since the series began and I'm still with it to this day, which technically puts me on your proverbial 'Red Team.' I, however, absolutely loved the Campaign in Halo 5 (it's on par with H2 and ODST IMO) so in that respect I'm a member of your 'Blue Team.'  That disparity is partially why I was hoping you had focused on more than just the Arena multiplayer in your write-up.
What character's you bring isn't that important. The top 3 things you want to consider for a team is:  1. gear, as much RS gear as possible 2. abilities, may fights have elemental or status weaknesses to exploit, and you need enough defensive abilities to stay alive 3. soul breaks, unique soul breaks are having like a 3rd ability slot because they can be mastered and used RS gear in other realms, and they are usually extremely powerful too  Once you've got figured out what gear, abilities, and soul breaks you want to bring, THEN you think about what the best characters are to cover all those needs, although characters are tied to their unique soul breaks, you might have to make adjustments based on RS gear.

I read the first two alineas and immediately wanted to make a remark. Step up, man up, gather some balls and take control. You are in control of your weight, marks and social standing. You want to weigh less? Do it, work for it, whatever it takes. You want better marks? Do it, work for it, whatever it takes. These situations   always remind me of a quote from Sylvester Stallone.   "The world isn't all sunshine and rainbows. It will knock you down to your knees and keep you there if you let it. It isn't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward!"  Good luck my friend, your time is limited, make it count.

It's a butter problem. You either used too much butter (or too little flour), or ignored the chilling the dough part of the recipe.   The former problem is actually pretty common, since most recipes in the US give flour amounts by volume, which is rather useless, since flour can be packed lightly or tightly, changing the actual amount of flour you're using by a lot.  The second problem is obviously more easily fixable, by simply chilling the dough for longer. It should be quite hard before you bake it.
This is the way I took it:  Death always results in returning as a walker, because everyone is infected.  Bites always cause death because they cause the wound to fester, the person bitten develops a huge infection that is resistant to antibiotics and immune response. The bitten person develops a high-grade fever, eventually slips into a coma and dies. Somehow the infection passed by bites 100% results in this - there's no real scientific explanation for why.  Blood/guts/etc possibly sometimes transmits the infection - but rarely it would seem. We haven't seen a definitive example. However they are still necrotic tissue/blood so it would transmit a normal infection if you were to get it in an open wound - this may be treatable with antibiotics/immune response. Unclear as of yet.

Yeah true, its whack when its unbalanced either way, whether it's PvE or PvP players only being able to get a certain level of gear.   In terms of PvP only people being toxic, I think it's just something that is more common with the whole competitive mindset.  Compared to other shooters like Halo or COD I feel like the trash talk etc is way milder in destiny actually. In PvE there's no "losers" per say, so it attracts more people who who like that more relaxed, everybody wins, attitude.  In any kind of competition you always have that 'fuck you, get rekt scrub, im better' thing going on.   Even in real life sports if you want to compete at a high level you have to go in believing that you're going to win, that you're better than everyone.  It also means that you're going to use the best equipment or strats (e.g. blink, thorn, sunbreaker) in order to win. Even in high school basketball, our coach would always say 'when is something a foul? When the ref sees you and calls it'.  You play the game you have, if something is OP then it's bungie's fault, or if people are getting away with fouls then it's the ref's fault for not calling them.   Does it mean that you have to be a dick and toxic about it all the time? No of course not, but a lot of people are just assholes, and PvP + the internet gives them an avenue to vent their assholeness.   
Discussions with people.
I'm having trouble visualizing this.  Is the garage door a typical multiple horizontal segment roll-up, or a single-panel swing-up, or what?  An inside and outside photo would help.  Who made the human door for it?  Was it the manufacturer?  If so they should have all conceivable cases covered.  If it was modified by an installer or someone else, I would be very suspicious.  You may want to contact your insurance company to see if you are covered for accidents involving this door.  Your liability in case of an accident would be enormous if it's not UL listed, etc..  The safety systems for garage doors is important and people died before they were required.  When I was young I had a neighbor whose child died from a door crush back then.  Don't risk it.

Certain parts of Amane's route dragged on for too long in my opinion. I nearly stopped reading mutiple times due to boredom.   [Amane's route](/s "I really hate flashbacks... They rarely add anything, and in Amane's case, it really only added majorly to Kazuki. All Amane's personal distress is 90% Cannibalism, 10% sorrow for what happened in general.")  Apart from Yumiko, Michiru also had the most realistic route.

That's one of the best throws Rudock has made this year. 
The point isn't the press sensitivity as much as being able to rest your finger on the buttons and then put pressure down to push the button. With the current process you have to hover your fingers over the button and then tap down. Or you can rest your fingers on the buttons from the last touch, but then when the button press comes along again, you need to quickly lift again to restore button functionality and tap down again.  3D Touch allows for constant finger resting and just a bit of pressure down to trigger the button functionality. It will be incredibly more comfortable. 
I was at a coop job and my coworker/fellow coop student was paying the same $7500 rate a term, while I was probably paying $5750 give or take a term before scholarships and other jazz at Carleton.   And even factoring in coop (you might be making $1500 - $2000 after expenses and fun if you're not in software) you're barely paying for next terms tuition and definitely not paying living expenses/supplies/books/fun. It's just plain nutty!

You're wrong. Having 175 penetration and inaccurate gun combined with mediocre speed and overrated armor (215 pen is enough to autoaim at you, you also have huge weakspots, because of is-6's fame most people load gold aswell) on tier 8 makes it hard to play. It's worse than IS-3 in every way.

If by 'in lock step with the orthodoxy' you mean I agree with physicists on the matter, then yes. I think you might be underestimating the experimental robustness behind some of the weirder aspects of quantum physics, things like the [Quantum eraser experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_eraser_experiment) for the collapse of a wavefunction and probability interference and the SternâGerlach experiment for the quantization of spatial orientation of angular momentum.   When you say that 'Objective probability' is a contradiction, what do you mean specifically? For instance if I were to flip a coin is its chance of landing heads or tails subjective? Or are you more alluding that while we may the probability for an *ideal* coin but not for an actual physical one?

Funny how you can tell where the guy served, you never see or hear anyone using the 95's in SodankylÃ¤ or Rovaniemi, propably not even Kajaani.

Back in the day we even had tanks (t-55) in SodankylÃ¤, now only bandvagens and trucks... well we have Hornets at Rovaniemi, my eardrums still remember them...  BTW: some of us were issued with the 62 with the round holes in the forearm, those also had different triggers and captive recoil springs like the original AK.

Haha, it isn't much, it's just me having a rant and then I put in a few words about how Wenger has changed English football at the end of it. I'd like to discuss Wenger more at some point but I might save that for his 20th anniversary, I'm tired at the moment and have work at 6AM tomorrow.  That said, never be sorry for trying to learn more about the club. It's great that you want to know more about us! There are a few books out there that I know a few people have recommended and Sky Sports and the likes have done a few documentaries on players such as Ian Wright who always take some time out to talk about Wenger, I'd say your best place to start looking is just around at what players and staff have said about him.

Pretty much the main reasons most of us hop on. Get bigger faster (legs and glutes mainly), increased libido. And she's getting a kick out of saying we're steroid buddies haha. She is more knowledgeable on steroids than most of the people I come across on r/steroids so she knows the risks as well. This was mostly her decision (I just helped suggest which hormone to use). It should be a fun time

Ah, that skill bracket. Pick a hard carry. When your teammates eventually abandon, you'll get extra gold per second which will help you tremendously. At that point, the enemy team will just clown around the map. Try to pick them out one by one slasher film style whenever you can.   When you get 6-slotted, wipe them all out. Void works pretty well in this situation.

You see, this "Asian drives bad" racial stereotype isn't at all true. Koreans and Japanese actually are exceptionally decent drivers.   The Chinese bad apples just have to fuck up the whole thing. A friend of mine in Vancouver actually saw a 50 year old Chinese guy spending literally 8 minutes trying to back out of a driveway. He was ever so careful when negotiating those rather unforgiving S turns.
the art on those is eerily similar. is skelton ship just painted over pirate ship? Artist name implies that.
Gibbs is a pretty big name DC. You can't expect anyone, even the best DC there has ever been, to turn around the Tech Defense in less than a season. He has to have time to get better recruits and teach the guys his scheme. When you've had 6 different DCs in 6 years, there is a lot of issues to fix. Tommy Tubs is the reason the team has so many problems. He left the department in a mess. 
You talking about valve dm right? and also how about the amount, just when i feel like my aim is on point and stuff? After school i don't have that much time so like 2 or 3 dms would be like max for me. And ill also try to stick to one of those sens.

For mine this year: I played as Liverpool because they are the team I support. I basically cleaned out shop in the first 2 windows because let's face it, our defenders are garbage. Lacazette at ST was my biggest purchase in season 1. I'm now in the beginning of the third and possibly final season for a bit. My front three transformed into Reus Lacazette Bale with Ozil in behind at CAM. A hidden gem in the team had to have been James Milner. He way outperformed what I expected of him. His passing was amazing, had good positioning in the midfield, and could even bang in a nice long shot now and again

I realize that Cajun French was formerly an entirely oral dialect, but what was was and what is is. We can't be tethered down by the past. We have extremely high literacy rates for English; it's no big thing to increase our French literacy rates for French too if we have any hope of making our preservation efforts stick in this very literacy-intensive world we now live in. Systems of orthography have already been well developed, and Fr. Daigle arguably already standardized the language.

Well, there's that and there's also federal regulations that require us to verify your identity to prevent other people from being able to defraud the company and steal your services.

Basically, the government says we have to and we don't want you losing your services or your identity because of negligence on our part.

I know, I was going to school in Indiana during that period and the hatred for the Pats for repeatedly spoiling the ostensibly impending Colts championships and Manning coronation was intense.  E.g., in 2005 the Colts had requested extra tickets to the AFCCG against the Steelers even before they played the Pats because they were so sure the Pats couldn't stand in their way.  People also forget that the national media was totally on board with Peyton=the best, it's-the-Colts-turn-this-season narrative wherein they kept trying to look past the Pats, which was rather annoying.

No, actually not hitting face and how, is main problem with face hunter. if you could hit face every time, you would win 90%. Also, once you run out of cards, you are done. That's why that stupid bird was that strong. it it is similar to current Divine favor - you draw cards as punishment to your opponent having cards. Which is certainly good counter to decks that want to hold many cards like combo - but it is used rather easily vs. many other decks.

I'm pretty disappointed with this course. In my section, there have been several occasions where the material on the quiz wasn't covered in lecture or recitation. I wasn't particularly fond of how the professor made it seem like chapter 3 would be a major portion of the exam, when there was only one question on that material. And correct me if I'm wrong, but we've never actually gone over how to formally prove an algorithm's correctness, which seems like it would be an important part of a course on algorithms.  Do you happen to know what the class average was for Szegedy's exam? If it's much higher than 58 then maybe Abello will give the extra credit opportunity he mentioned on Sakai.

Breaking Point is an Arma 3 mod and DayZ (while started as a mod) is a standalone game. A lot of people criticize DayZ Standalone for focusing on the wrong things like making apples pickable from trees or farming mechanics instead of zombie pathing.  Breaking Point goes in a different direction and adds a "class system" which basically gives you a role, for example Rangers lose "class points" if they kill innocent classes vs hunters who get class points for killing anyone.  The biggest problem in the original DayZ mod was the kill on sight mentality and it was difficult to tell what kind of person someone was just by looking at them, which is why the Breaking Point mod has specific skins for specific classes. DayZ standalone has clothing scattered around which allows more customization of how you look but keeps the problem of not knowing what kind of player someone is just by looking at them.

That's actually kind of cool. I wonder why the emphasis on "capacitor bank" rather than just saying "power supply" or "weld timer"?  While the technique is cool, it's the end result that's important. Introducing the heat in a weld changes microstructure, and so that fancy 1000 MPa ultra high strength steel you've just welded only has, say, half the strength at its joints, so now you have to have product geometry that takes this into account. What this means is that you can preserve material strength _and_ improve product design.

It sounds like what you're looking for is an inpatient mental health program, which you'll likely need a referral from a psychiatrist or therapist to get into, rather than a psychiatric stay in a hospital.  Like I said, you need a referral most of the time for insurance to cover inpatient programs and you have to convince your insurance that it is necessary for your well-being (and even if you do most insurances don't cover more than a 30 day program) and if/when you find a program you have to hope that they have an opening for you, as well.  It would probably be better to have an open and honest discussion with your therapist regarding how your feeling about things right now and go from there.  Tell her why you think a mental hospital sounds like a good idea and see what she says and if she might have any resources to help you that don't involve being hospitalized.  I mean, you *could* go to a crisis center and get an evaluation and see what they recommend if you don't feel comfortable talking to your therapist, but then you run the risk of being admitted into a psychiatric unit in a regular hospital and believe me, you don't want that, they are the furthest thing from appealing.  Overall, I get the feeling that you're looking for support more than anything else, a place where you can feel accepted and not judged, and perhaps a reprieve from yourself.  Perhaps looking into group therapy options in your area would be better suited for you?  That way you can work on your struggles in a controlled and non-judgmental space with people who can relate to you while continuing to work and explore your new hobbies.  Best of luck.

the Excel is a nice riser, but IMO overpriced for what you are getting - that Hoyt badge is expensive.  looking at the current Lancaster prices, I would go for a SF Premium Plus for $10 less first, assuming you don't want to spend more than the Hoyt.  you get much better limb pocket hardware, two berger holes so you can run a bolt-on rest if you want, a much better grip than the plasticky thing Hoyt supply, and you get upper and more importantly lower front bushings which will help a lot with stringwalking.  the only thing I don't really like is that I wish they would supply a decent allen head bolt for the clicker mount instead the cheap philips head, but that won't affect you.
Yeah I definitely would, I ended up getting 100% on my essay which was marked by my TA. It took me a very short time to write and the fluency in my writing seemed to come easy after taking noopept. I am definitely happy with the grade since it was worth 10% of my grade!

Yea there's no way that the game would be made in UE4, even with earlier access to it, even if they would just port it over(if that's even possible). UE4 was released ~~this year~~ last year, you don't make a game of that volume in such a short amount of time.  Edit: I need to research a bit more.

Well if the frame size fits just right and works with the integrated post you could shave off a decent amount of weight. When you become a weight weenie and start counting every gram this seems like a cheap (relatively so) way to shave off a few more grams vs standard seatpost.  Just remember, if it looks stupid and it works...it ain't stupid.

I love going to the movies alone. I find it very relaxing and stress free. I think I would enjoy going on a vacation alone. It would be nice to be able to do whatever I wanted without having to worry about pleasing everyone.   The thought of going to a concert alone makes me nervous. They are very social events and I feel like I would miss having a friend with me. Unfortunately, I need to decide if I want to go to the concert alone or not go at all. I'm not sure if I would enjoy it as much though.

I saw this scene early this year,and knew immediately that it would be one of my favorite shows, but I didn't get around to watching it. Around May, a friend asks facebook for suggestions on new shows to watch, and knowing his personality, I told him "Rick and Morty. I swear Joe, this will become one of your favorite shows."   So he starts watching it. INSTANT FAVORITE.   I catch up and hang out with him at his place after like a year of only seeing him on facebook, around the beginning of September, and I still haven't watched it. He asks me if I wanna watch an episode or two of Rick and Morty.   Oh man, that look of utter bafflement and disbelief on his face when I told him instill hadn't ever actually watched a full episode.   We then binge watched the full series the rest of the night. So glorious. I was even able to watch the rest of the 2nd season new.

The irony of the US is that it hasn't been overtaken by a more powerful foe and I don't foresee one for a while since the US has an insane navy and airforce. Yet despite these things we get beaten by guerrillas with RPGs and AK-47s.  We involve ourselves in wars that we don't allow ourselves to utilize our overwhelming force.  We defeated conventional Iraq easily but didn't prepare ourselves for counterinsurgency and essentially occupation.  The leaders and brass are more to blame for the decline of the US than the general population imo.
Tipping in restaurants is actually frowned upon in most countries; the staff are expected to give good service because it's their job to do so, not because they'll get extra money from the guests. It should go without saying that the servers in other countries get higher salaries than the ones in the US (relatively speaking; not talking about foreign exchange value of the pay or anything); they don't have this idea of "we'll pay them less than minimum wage and let the customers pay the rest"
I went on a date with a great girl from my university classes that I've known for a while on Thursday and we had a great time. The next day we both go to the same Halloween party that we've both been excited about for weeks.   All is going well, we find each other at various times throughout the night and exchange hugs, jokes etc. I finally ask her to come dance and she agrees, but at this point I notice she's clearly on something (e probably), and struggle to keep up and she basically sprints around the room.   I end up taking a breather and talk to this chick standing at a nearby table which I guess triggers a jealousy reaction from the girl I like (100% unintended) and she basically immediately comes up to me and hugs me. Not long after we kiss for the first time, maybe 5 seconds. At this point I'm on top of the moon as she runs off and I attempt, again unsuccessfully, to keep up while she goes off like a frog in a sock. Again I get over it (it was actually was really annoying) and go back to talking to old bird standing at a nearby table.   We chat for a while as I wait for the girl I like to calm down and maybe come over and chill, or at least stop running around so I can dance with her, when suddenly mid conversation the girl I was talking to goes "hey PATOMARK, your girlfriend is hooking up with another guy.". I look over and sure enough the chick I literally went out with the day before, and who hooked up with me earlier in the night, was sucking face with some other dude.   Well as you'd expect that pissed me right off. My friends saw the whole thing go down and asked me if I wanted to bail which I definitely did, and we went home.   I got home and was (thanks to a combination of alcohol and having genuine feelings for this girl) extremely livid. I went upstairs, grabbed my headphones, went straight into my home gym with 2L of water, and banged out 5x5 body weight (+ a few extra kilos) squats (smashed my PB by about 7.5kgs). I've never anger lifted before, but by god was it satisfying. Being drunk had no impact on my form or power, I think the powerful emotions it heightened only gave me strength.   I know this was less of a gym story, and more of a personal one, however I really needed to vent and get this shit off my chest. I don't care at all that she hooked up with another guy, that's her right considering its only one date we've been on. I just hated that it was after kissing me, and also where I'd obviously be able to see it (about 10m away from where I was). I also hate that it bothered me so much, but I did genuinely like her a lot.   tl;dr - a girl I like kissed me at a party, then proceeded to kiss another dude basically in front of me causing me to go home and anger squat a big PB.

I hear you in the joint things! I played with barbies and GI Joes and the GI Joes were far superior in my eyes because they had opposable fingers (vulcan style, at the first knuckle).   I could make him hang off light switches and door frames and that was super fun. I'd always find weird places to put him and leave him for my dad to find when he got home from work.   I'm studying to be a music teacher now, so I don't think the toys had much effect on me.

Just a quick comment on your setup - I would move that sub to the floor if you can. The vibration it produces is not good for tracking and sound reproduction. I know we're not dealing with super high end stuff but ideally, all speakers/subs are isolated from each other and from the turntable.  Also, do you remember where you got the skull? I've been looking for something similar to use as a headphone stand.

If you follow the links back to the original post, you can see they are talking in reference to other *flexible* phototransistor.  "It shows the capabilities of high-sensitivity photodetection and stable performance under bending conditions, which have never been achieved at the same time."  Also, from reading the [abstract](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adom.201500402/pdf) it seems they are applying a method similar to back-side illuminated sensors to these new flexible phototransistors, which accounts for some of its higher sensitivity.  "Overall, such flexible phototransistors with the capabilities of high sensitivity light detection and stable performance under the bending conditions offer great promises for high-performance flexible optical sensor applications, with easy integration for multifunctional applications."  So in comparison to rigid phototransistors, it might be crappy.

I'd rather play Magic because in MTG I have a choice of game mode. I can play 2 headed Giant, Emperor, Standard, Modern/Extended, Legacy, Commander, and any combination of the above, and then some.  Hearthstone has 3 game modes: Tavern Brawl (which is hit or miss and cycles each week), Casual/Ranked, and Arena.  I'd love to have more options, like a Pauper format (where only commons and basic cards are allowed) or a Singleton format (where you can only have 1 copy of each card) or a Draft format (basically competitive arena.)  Blizzard doesn't seem interested in developing different game modes though, so whatever.

Anet has said it's the fastest growing game mode. Whether or not you think that's because it was tiny before or not, it's undeniable that it is becoming more popular. Well, unless you think Anet is lying about that. I used the word maybe because I don't really care, but just look at the title of the thread.

Anything you add to the channel strip will show up as an option for automation.   [Here is a screenshot showing all the things you listed, automated.](http://imgur.com/2cOVtZx)  Yellow arrows show the buttons where you expose general channel strip automation, and the variable tempo (you may have to right click in that area to "Show Tempo"). Blue arrows show the actual parameters. The triangle next to the "read" dropdown opens so you can "add" multiple views so you can see many automations at once. It doesn't add the automation itself, just allows you to show a bunch of parameters at once.   Here is what the track in the screenshot sounds like: https://soundcloud.com/spiesteleviv/automation/s-nLqN3
Good  It's a pretty spaceship game and who doesn't love space ships  Star Trek  You can easily finish all content (except pvp but no one pvp's anyways) without paying. Not the sure but you have to grind for months some games have either. You can do it with cheap gear off the exchange if you know what you're doing.  Sort of similar to the above but all content is available for free and nothing is pay gated.  Space combat is fun and some of the missions are actually pretty good.  Progress speed is reasonable as long as you're not trying to get the best of everything.  Bad  If you're a min maxxer and like the build optimized characters the cost is truly outrageous. There's no chance 90% of the player base is ever going to afford all the shiny gadgets you need.   I recently logged back in and tallied up what it would cost to build my characters from scratch and the results were mind boggling considering the fact I hadn't played in a year and the game has powered creeped even more. The break down goes something like 500m ec worth of ships, 1billion+ ec worth of traits and assorted modules, 200+ dollars worth of dilithium if it were all converted from zen, 5m+ fleet marks worth of fleet gear and since I quit before t6 ships were a thing I don't even have any starship trait of which the ones you need are mostly from 25 dollar or lockbox ships. The amount of grinding a new player would need to do to catch up is astronomical.  Ground combat. This one is a bit subjective since apparently some people actually like it but in my opinion it's not as good as the space combat.  tl;dr  Totally give it a try if you want to play around in a star trek theme park and just have fun. Stay far far away if you want to min max your character.

Probably to mark desired spots precisely on war map.  Indeed it would be great to paint on high res surfaces. Even with 25 colors, you could make something out of it. But at the moment, bright colors can't override war map's background image therefore it forces you to use dark colors.

Agreed. They are trying to highlight pre-lims. The best example of this is the fact that they are calling the last fight the main event. I do think though that it would have been smarter to give Faber the main card or main event of the pre-lims. Seeing your next potential title contender who just headlined a fight night in his last appearance landing in the middle of the pack on a pre-lim sort of sends a mixed signal

Well, think about this:  Clinton and her supporters are saying you should vote for her because she's the pragmatic candidate, and although she isn't as left as Bernie, she'll be able to get more things leftists care about done than Bernie.  Well, Trump wants to get rid of tax loopholes that benefit the rich, greatly increase taxes on Wall Street's speculative investments, and he wants to get rid of SuperPACs.  These are things I'm sure you agree with.  What chance do you think Hillary Clinton has in making ANY progress on these issues as President, with a Republican congress?  What about Trump?  (Bear in mind that liberal SuperPACs vastly outspent conservative SuperPACs in 2014 - not sure why liberals think conservatives like them).  By the logic of Hillary Clinton and her supporters, you must vote Trump.  So if she's your nominee, follow her advice.

Not entirely crazy but it's an expensive thing to self-fund.  You can start cheaper with an RTLSDR.  It's not a calibrated spectrum analyzer but it's a fun toy that can be educational.  People were just talking about bias tee design for LNAs at /r/RTLSDR.  The Ettus is good but there is no box that covers all corners of frequencies, bandwidth, etc.   Another option is to pick up an older HP T&amp;M spectrum analyzer, working or not, and get it running.  That's what most ham radio people do for RF work.  Also look at getting stick time on other people's equipment if you can.
Nope not using either. Not sure if I see the benefit to adding another complexity to the build process. All of our images are svg and they get packaged into the css as a data-uri and js comes in one file. Whole app has 2 requests to the server for everything.

It wouldn't do any good. All the questions are on the sidebar, Google could answer them faster and more effectively, or they could just try _something_. But no, they post it here, it gets upvoted, and it never stops. It's like Groundhog Day.  Also, do you know why plex is marking my anime wrong? I saw something about naming conventions, but I WON'T do that. I like how I have it named and filed.
fallout 4 is indeed butt ugly but that's not what worries me. What bothers me is that it looks like an expansion pack for fallout 3 with slightly better graphics. all these people saying 'i don't care about the graphics' are kind of missing the point....this is a next gen bethesda game that appears to function like a last gen bethesda game in every way. there doesn't seem to be anything under the hood simulation wise that looks like a step up from previous games. I could be wrong but this seems like it was a ps3/360 game up until very recently and the lack of advancement or design based around new hardware is a huge disappointment. Granted, both MGSV and GTAV were last gen games and they are still amazing on the new hardware but.....it's still highly disappointing that a new fallout will be more of a slight iteration than a full on next gen upgrade. 
Pretty much every action film since Die Hard has tried to be like Die Hard. The everyman lone hero out of his depth with some humour and character focused scenes in between the action is pretty much required from all action films made in the last 20 years, and most of them can thank Die Hard for that.

Women think you are gay because you dress well and you go into the conversation with more energy than they have. It is a shit test. When they ask, in some form, "Are you gay?" You answer, "No, just slightly amused." If they continue to ask, you can do one of two things: 1) If you find her attractive, you say "let's find out" as you lean in to kiss her. 2) If you don't find her attractive, you say, "So I'm gay because I have standards?"

By The Sword in My Hand is a goddamn beastly song! 
Here in my graveyard, just bought this new mausoleum here. Itâs fun to chill up here in the Black hills. But you know what I like more than dead things? Calcium. In fact, Iâm a lot more proud of these strong, beautiful bones that I now have so that I can hold my own against an army of two thousand fuccbois. Itâs like the spooky skeleton Jack Skellington says, âthe more you thank, the more calcium you have.â Now maybe youâve read my obituary where I talk about how I thank 20 times a day. You know, I thank 20 times a day not to show off, itâs again about the calcium. In fact, the real reason I live in this mausoleum here is that itâs a reminder. A reminder that strong bones are still possible, because it wasnât that long ago that I was in a little coffin across the country with weak bones and osteoperosis. I didnât have my own dooter, I had no spooky scary self-esteem. But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a skeltal. And another skeltal. And a few more skeltals. I found five skeltals. And they showed me what they did to become spooky and rich in calcium. Again, itâs not just about the bones, itâs about the good death; spookiness, doots, thanks and sweet calcium. And so I wrote a little epitaph, itâs actually on my gravestone, you can read thesd directions here and itâll take you to my cemetary where I share three things that mr skeltal taught me. Three sp00ky things that you can implement today no matter where you are. Now, this isnât a âget good bones quickâ scheme. You know, like they say, if things sound too dooty to be trooty, they are too good to be true. Iâm not promising you that tomorrow youâre gonna be able to wake up with strong and beautiful bones. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know how to thank mr skeltal. So, I wrote a little message on my tombstone. Like I said, now itâs not the most spooky, I just engraved it with a chisel, but itâs real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And Iâm going to give you the three sp00kiest things you can do today. Invest in your bones. Always thank mr skeltal. Donât be a fuccboi. Okay, people see messages like this and they say âAh thatâs not sp00ky thatâs for some other skelly.â Donât listen, donât listen. Be a dooter. Like, mr skeltal, the skelly who started /r/ledootgeneration. He said that he was only 1300 years old when he read a scroll by Hades, and that book changed his bones. Books can change your bones. And in that scroll, Hades said âthankâ so if youâre a fuccboi, if youâre not a real skelly you donât need to listen. Donât worry about it, I donât need to talk to every skelly. But if youâre a skelly who knows that thereâs something spookier, cause good bones are possible, you know, for some of you listening itâs not necessarily a new dooter, maybe itâs more calcium, a new beginning, starting to build up your bones. Maybe itâs a new death without so many spoops, traveling the underworld, thanking mr skeltal like youâre destined to do. You can't do those unless you understand calcium. Calcium, I donât call it calcium anymore, I call it thank units. You must have enough thank units to grow strong bones and to doot your way to the top. So, Iâll see you at my cemetary. So just follow this map to my mausoleum here, Iâm excited to share this sp00ky stuff. Youâll see, not because of anything of me but because Iâve been fortunate enough that mr skeltal is gracious with his calcium. I love to read scrolls but I also love real personal skelly friends. So let me share with you these three tips that have made my bones strong and rich in calcium. Theyâre practical, you can do them today, you can start thanking today. All right? See you there. Thank mr skeltal.

Wouldn't it be nice if twice a year all street lights and other sources of light pollution would get turned off for a hour or to, just so we could see the stars.  I think of this because last night my nephew said"wow that is a lot of stars".  I looked up to see maybe 1000 stars and realized he has never seen a truly dark sky.  soon I am going to drive  five or six hours into Maine so he can have his mind blow and see the Milky Way!
He is stacked at WR and a little bit weak at RB. I doubt he would take it. Maybe target a different team.

Not sure if this would apply as my knowledge is based here in New Zealand. The insurance company needs to compensate you for the amount of damages their client has caused. If you advised them that vehicle originally was purchased for $6,000 then with the repair estimate at $5,600 it would be uneconomical to consider repairing.  I know we worked to around a 75% to 80% repair cost to pre-accident value. Ask the insurer to pay you $6,000 and they can dispose of the wreck.

I've been to all three. I would go to Urumqi, then Lanzhou, then Nanchang.   All three are polluted, and have pluses and minuses when it comes to travel. Urumqi means you can travel in the Xinjiang region, which most people can't do, but you are far from the HSR network and the coastal cities, and Nanchang would be best for that. Lanzhou gives you good access to northwestern China and Inner Mongolia, and is closer to places like Xi'an. Even Beijing and Shanghai are easy to get to by train.  For culture, what do you mean exactly?  Also, have you checked the Wiki pages for all three and taken climate and food into account?
Cool. So we'll just have wild monkeys with extremely dry hair and zero bounce. Complete fucking bullshit.
&gt; but as you said. It's not what people buy.  since most people tend to buy from bestbuy/walmart. yea...  &gt; because I shouldn't have to spend hours trying to figure out if it's crap or not.  i spend a good amount of time researching the product i plan on buying beforehand to avoid this. im petty sure you can do the same.  &gt; can still be a better windows laptop than 90% of windows laptops.  this is debatable.

It comes down to alot of things. The talent inherent in its performance, the catchiness of the melody and lyrics, and of course, the breakdown. It's kinda musical stew, and it's amazing it even works. So you first hear it and you're following this pretty epic ballad full of guitar solos and awesome vocals when all of a sudden, opera. It's a super cool juxtaposition and it's very intriguing, easy to sing along to, and fun. The follow up question on whether it would still be a hit now is tough, odds are it would be a cult hit, but that's due to the culture we're in. The popular music scene today doesn't have room for weird experimental rock opera. And that's sad.
Look at the different screenshots it's obvious they borrowed ideas from some popular HUD mods on FONV and Skyrim, the different parts of the HUD completely disappear when not in use. The HUD is made to deliver information while looking oldschool not for permanent residence on the screen.

No, I'm pointing out the absurdity of his claim of seeing no nude males when most of these are female characters. Thus, his assertion is completely invalid.

Analytics isn't about possession, it's about finding what correlates best to future success.  Corsi was originally invented as a proxy for possession, but there's also a difference between pure possession and *useful* possession.  For example, you can control the puck for 5 minutes in the offensive zone, but if you're not shooting the puck then it's not useful possession from an offensive standpoint.  Analytics has concluded that faceoffs actually aren't that important in the grand scheme of things, because team can easily compensate for a faceoff loss.  In other words, faceoff wins don't correlate to future success all that much.

Nope, I'm comparing this with the severely intellectually handicapped people I worked with in the past.   People with IQs not even as low as this INT score.   The people I worked with had IQs quite a bit higher than this character would have, but were nonetheless requiring of full time care just to survive.   If 10 INT is average, and 15+ exceptional, then 3 would be about 30 - borderline profound intellectual disability.  You're really underestimating how low that INT really is.  So no I'm comparing the INT score with IQ scores, not wisdom.
LOL

No worries, if you are on xbox one I will add you and run whenever I am off work, I work 12 hour shifts but can make myself available on my days off to get you through the content, after a few runs you can run in the LFG websites/reddit for endgame without issue.  My clan has 7 to 8 members of varying abilities, we have a close knit group of regional teams, merged in one fire team. English AND Welsh!!! We have a good laugh and run Kings raids, strikes, quests (sword/artifact/daily weapon) etc.   If you are on PS4 I can't do anything until I buy TTK... and that won't be a while as I only have a singled person on PSN active.
I'm not sure that it was abused so much as that it wasn't clear what its function or purpose was to be. This led me to enter numbers that I estimated to be the total rate of extraction for the entire server, thinking that this would show the rate at which those resources would be exhausted from some quantity known left to exist. Instead of spitting out a number as I expected, it thanked me for my data. In other words, I probably messed it up all by myself, without meaning to.
TWD doesn't often leave ambiguous deaths unless they plan to do more with that character. They also like to really drive it in when a major character dies.. so based on that I don't see why one would think this is the case.  Glen still has some stuff to do I think. I believe he may pass soon but they'd make it a finale event

Yeah, I'm not sure what that's all about. I checked GCL on my phone for shits and giggles on our Columbus Day matinee game because I was stuck at work during the game. It worked and I figured it was just special for the holiday, but I've been able to get NESN ever since, which was blacked out for me last year. I think they decided to allow it after that law suit. 
Aging is merely the [accumulation of damage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMAwnA5WvLc) so to reverse aging would be to repair said damage. In that case, you wouldn't be a frail, sick old person but a biologically youthful one. When you look at it like that, the question isn't who would want to live that long, but who would want to get sick.

Yup, what Anthony Bourdain and others like him are basically saying is get rid of the illegals, say goodbye to exploiting cheap labor.  Question is why would that part bother a liberal? To me it sounds like a supporting argument to support Trump's position. Stop the exploitation of millions of hard workers, force the industries to pay more. Less able bodies flooding the workforce always benefits the workers. Better for a union to form and succeed, but even without a union employers always pay more when there isn't 10 other men waiting to do the job.

You can find posts where some say the 6s has a worse radio than the 6.   Back in the day, I was on a design team for modem chips, we bench tested every competitor and could tell you who was best. However we didn't need the lawsuits.   My point being none of these tech websites really tests phones. Now I bet every manufacturer has test data on the competition, but the results are not released.   I don't see radio performance improving given the current state of the tech websites.

Yeah I was excited when Google told me they would tell FedEx to hold my package for me at the facility. However I contacted them 24 hours later again because my tracking wasn't updated (still on course to be delivered to my house). All they said was that they can only ask FedEx to hold it, they can't force them to.

Nope, you cannot complete archetype quests with your own decks. Technically you can but you have to avoid using "good" cards, meaning those that the archetype deck wizard won't offer to you. If just one single card that is not on the approved archetype list is present, you cannot win the archetype quest. Now if your decks are passing the archetype quests, I don't think they are very good or enjoyable

Yeah. The vehicles in 4 and 5 have felt real floaty and fast. I mean it responds fast, but at the same time it feels a little loose in the turns. I used to be able to drive the warthog perfectly. It was what I did. I think I have more Wheelman and splatter medals than anything else.   But, I still haven't gotten used to vehicles in this game. I mean, granted it's still new. But, they definitely feel different. Maybe once BTB is released and warthogs aren't exclusively from REQ packs, we'll all get better at driving them.
They must be paying off the police of Danville, Alamo, Diablo, Blackhawk and all the other surrounding communities, too. Can't just be because it's an affluent area...
Tuskarr already is a slightly more complicated version of previous cards, I don't see the problem with Healbot being outvalued rather than 5/5s for 5 -like Stranglethorn Tiger- which are mostly unplayable right now.   *Edit: Loatheb is playable, other 5/5s are not*
I don't view holding grudges or cutting myself off from family as in my best interest. Burning bridges isn't my thing, although it might be yours.
God, how are the people here so stupid?  Do they not understand the concept of muscle memory?  Jesus
...can you bring some Modern Time with you?
Read the reviews! There are a dozens reasons not to get it. Save your cash and get a samsung/LG, or jp make. 
The Midnighters by Scott Westerfeld perhaps?
Ah ok. Not like he's missed
&gt; vocÃª Ã© muito pior que o moleque que roubava a sua loja.  Ã provÃ¡vel, mas e daÃ­? Eu nÃ£o ligava mais pra isso. No jogo de picaretagem generalizada, Ã©tica era o que menos importava. Era sÃ³ um jogo de sacanagem contra sacanagem.
amazing how fantasy can put your trust in the hands of your enemies haha.
How would the product know the paint was pearescent?  It is under the clear coat right?  So as far as the product is concerned; it does not matter what color the paint is when it is a 2 stage paint job.
Now he can come back home and save his team in the dumpster fire they're in considering he now has experience as to what one is...
I don't think Walmart is a very good place to lift from for a first timer. I see a lot of videos online of employees going out of their way to catch shoplifters, they don't seem to mind being physical.
you can get apollo for free playing 5 matches (even coops or practice) with curse voice,  So i will say nemesis
Jashon got his spot back. 
I bought two sneek peeks as well. Noone wanted to play with the cards though, so we didn't end up doing a tournament. I pulled a racoon, a secret starlight, a majester xyz, and a Leonidas. Sold the racoon to a friend for cheap(20). Traded the majester for two of the big dd fusions. Got most of the DD and like all of the graydles I wanted. Pretty happy. Plus like 5 fluffal wings. I still need the frightfur fusion though...
That's be really cool, but there's no way GameDay would go to the same conference three weeks in a row. 
If everyone modded the usual cars, the world would be full of typical vehicles.  I love the idea of someone investing their money into making a Yaris fast. Why? Because we have already seen what a Mustang, Corvette, S2000, M3, etc., can do when modded properly.  It's fun to see these other cars get the same treatment as those "usual cars." It's original.  Hell, if I had the money, I'd invest it into making my Chevy Cruze fast. Why? Because why the hell not?
Lmao I don't actually think penny sucks you donut 
TextSecure/Signal are considerably more user friendly.

The thing is they only have had one poll in the past month in Nevada, so we don't really have much to go on there. It was a Biden poll though, that is a good point.
The mustang is much lower than most cars so the light dont really seem to bother anyone 
  I'd say the Eridani could use 5 more bullets as base as example.
She's a center left democrat. Why assume if she's saying center left things that she's pandering, and not just articulating a center left message? Why swallow the line Republicans have been feeding you on her for 10 years? 
See, the gif which the Redditors rejected as become the chief upvote^22. This is **THE HORSE_SIZED_DICK's** doing, and it is marvelous to our eyes.^23  -- /r/HighQualityGifs 118:22-23
Just amazing 
If Economics was truly a science, then it stands to reason that Economics Professors would be the richest people on Earth. They are not.

Good lord, I didn't even know they disappeared the hidden blades.. WHY. It is pretty much the iconic assassin's weapon, been with the series since the beginning even! And to not be able to use it as a primary.. wow.  I never purchased Unity because of the terrible reviews and issues with it, looks like I add another reason not to get it for anything more than 75%+ off...
Cabochard/Shook/Froggen guys, you heard it here first
Nice.
Again, very good homework!
Lol they're in drop a# but the thought of open d makes me laugh
TIBALT HYPE
Simmons new podcast is essentially a gambling analysis podcast. He does about 3 pods a week and at least 2 of them are about lines/gambling.

I seriously don't understand how you can hate on his game. How can you not enjoy watching one of the most exciting players in the league? Its not even like he is a chucker, he is efficient as fuck. Get over yourself and respect greatness.
Fucking come on Minnesota.
"So...everything looks clear here."
I would suggest you pepper ur angus and be ready to be on a ship for the next few years.  If you are on my ship and can get us angus beef that would be cool too.
OSU has won 20 straight against Indiana. We haven't lost since 1991
The "safe zone" isn't really a safe zone, just guarded by npcs, which being attacked by is basically a death sentence. Dying in deadman mode is pretty harsh, so nobody will generally want to die like that.
Have faith, sir.
Real or photoshopped???
What's this?
Ok. Cool
Maybe. I never watched Mindy Kaling's show, but I have heard so much about how she only dates white men on her show. 
Agreed.
Rocky Horror Picture Show @ Bloor Hot Docs Cinema or Evil Dead The Musical @ Randolph Theatre 
All because American hero Stanzi got hurt :(

&gt; TLDR: Failure to adapt to society is not "intelligent".  Fucking lol. Man, your comments just get better. You're an odd one. 
ok
Yet at the same time, Overwatch has exposed people who otherwise would not have checked out the game en masse. Twitch numbers are ridiculous for Overwatch. Chances are, your favorite YouTuber is playing. Their beta, if anything, is getting people ON the boat.   Not to mention people who have been alienated are probably still thirsty for the game. Let's face it, all the people who are angry? Still willing to play the game at a drop of the hat once they get access.
Let's go mets.
Exercise is a hell of a drug.
What I've learnt is the 49ers 'faithful' are a bunch of fuck heads who are less faithful then the bottom of my shoe. The supporters are a bunch of squibs.
