With good timing. See the dots, send the moo. They‚Äôll hit send just after yours sends.
Yah sure
That‚Äôs the tests aren‚Äôt that good. You have about 20% false negatives. How they administer the test is also a factor.  Did they go far enough into the sinus cavity? Leave it there long enough (doing a few turns) to collect enough virus? Did your wife use a nasal spray before going?   We have people in the hospital who are testing negative when we can see the disease being active in their lungs. People who test negative one day, with symptom, and positive the next.   No test is perfect, but people are thinking a negative means they don‚Äôt have it and it‚Äôs just not true. Think of it as one indicator. If you test positive, that‚Äôs another indicator that your wife is positive. Symptoms are another indicator.
He won‚Äôt be a top laner he‚Äôs still a assasin not a bruiser
Okay thanks bro. And I just mean when I smoke it my vision is a little affected and I almost feel a body high but I guess that's normal. And that .2% isn't enough to trigger a fail even if you take a test right after smoking?
Happened to me too. I thought it was interesting because I was a Magistrate Court Judge and they wanted $50,000 for my Maltese.
Glad all has been resolved and you got your tablet. You should get your mom a blouse that's your size so when she opens it and it's too big, you can take it for yourself.

Oh I mean when she wore braids once and the internet dragged her I felt bad for her. But blackface and her skimono or something line was pretty bad
Oh wikipedia said so, must be true.
How is NYT an example of "cancel culture" it seems like just lots of people having their voice heard.   "canceling" someone is a valid opinion one might want to express, and if you can't stop it without suppressing their freedom of speech.
Unrelated, but how do you subscribe to their email?

It‚Äôs a moat, i think it is part of a man mad lake too(not sure tho).
This pretty much confirms that Presti is literally eyeing draft picks from other teams and actively looking to trade his guys. Which is kind of an asshole thing to do and honest at the same time.  It would be weird to play for the team when you know that the GM is eyeing to trade you for picks. Regardless of how upfront he is about it. Just me I guess.
That will be interesting! Keep us updated!

Probably thought this ending would be taken as a "At least some version of us lives on and is with all our loved ones." But it neglects the "The rest of us are stuck on this rock with a near-unsalvageable world dying around us" part.

Yeah, I'll admit I was leaning on the diminished capacity, cooperation and overall efficiency of the development team during the pandemic for my main argument to explain those changes.   Even so, as CA can sweep any argument made in this thread off the table with the words: "All art is subjective and at no point have we made a commitment to a previously established style", I figured we were all just speaking our minds. Although some opinions are clearly held in higher esteem than others.

It really isn‚Äôt. The intent of the parables in the Old Testament is not the same as the intent of the gospels. To claim that they should be treated as such ignores the tradition and point of creation stories.   You are looking at a compilation of many works over many centuries, not a single text.

Okay I understand what you‚Äôre saying. I think I misconstrued your argument as more along the lines of ‚Äòit‚Äôs definitely a placebo‚Äô than what you were actually saying, that it needs more studying to truly be evident either way. I definitely agree with you on all the points you‚Äôre making and I have noticed quite a few ‚Äúmiraculous and totally unknown!‚Äù attitudes and just general pseudoscience claims that I do not agree with ITT. Thank you for having such a civil discussion about this on your end, and I apologize if I seemed to be berating you (idk if it did I just want to make sure) because you are obviously a very intelligent and well read person! Also if I had more time I‚Äôd love to talk about data collection tools because I genuinely did not know about that. Stay cool my dude!
thank you so much !! your words are very inspiring, i‚Äôll take them to heart and hope the best of you no matter the results !! &lt;3
There are true cases where PES F have caused so much trouble/difficulty in life where people have written in to MPs to reverse the PES F (which by the way cannot be reversed).   It does not mean that PES F will definitely be damning for all PES F people.   Also depends on what you are PES F for. If PES F is for previous history of cancer, unlikely you get huge problems with jobs or visas.   CPF and Housing is indirect, i.e. you can‚Äôt get employed therefore cpf and housing affected.   In the end, the effects of PES F can range from absolutely nothing (some people even claim they are favoured by companies because they don‚Äôt have to do reservice!) to devastating.   In the end, good or bad, each PES F is very specific and individualised, you will have to go with your gut since it‚Äôs your life, but be prepared for potential consequences too. PES F is taken quite seriously, since it is basically SAF saying, someone is so unwell that they would not want this person to even be a service clerk in the military.   It would be somewhat simplistic to think that you can have a medical condition that can discharge you from compulsory military service even in service vocations, and yet have zero consequences and does not affect you in real life.

You could try the Recruit Edition starter set ($50). It‚Äôs got five Assault Intercessors and a Primaris Lieutenant, and you could include making up a custom chapter as part of the competition. Then, you could do the same thing with the Necron half, making custom dynasties! And if you want it to be $75, you can add a character for $20-30.

&gt; decades of experience deferring maintenance in order to hold onto operations  And this is why federal support of transit in the US has had such abysmal results: federal support is almost always in the form of grants for *capital projects* instead of operations, which is where agencies need help the most.   &gt; If we replaced fare revenue with tax revenue to cover Muni‚Äôs operating costs, it smooths out these catastrophic issues with ridership  100%. MUNI‚Äôs funding structure is super regressive. We charge lower income riders high fares while giving enormous subsidies to owners of for-profit mobility devices in the form of extremely cheap parking on public land. Can‚Äôt forget prop 13 too, which ensures that as the demand for services increase, the extra revenue that would typically come from property taxes to support that demand gets captured by the rentier class.

I don't agree with this -- I think the main reason people get stuck in Bronze or Silver is that they don't learn how they game works; instead they play it based on how they \*think\* it works.  A skilled player can make a huge difference on almost any hero in a low-ranked game, whereas an unskilled player doesn't even know \*how\* to play the 'optimal' hero in the way that makes them good.  So yeah..  This isn't to say that hero choices can't help in particular situations.  But the truth is, a lot of people in Silver are playing their roles completely incorrectly anyway, and they are convinced that it's the opposite.
I mean, I get what they're saying, I reckon of all cherry pies on earth at any given time less than 1% are in bear traps, I like those odds

It is not weird. The music is a catharsis for many of us fans. I grew up, got married, had kids. There were moments in my life where NIN got me through rough times as a young man.

Good luck to both of you and I hope she gets through this.

To be fair legalizing a drug is very different from keeping it illegal but legalizing testing. It's a preventative measure along the lines of needle exchanges, which Labour also implemented back in the 80s.

That's what a full-stack developer friend of mine said. He said when you're starting out, it's easy to worry about "wasting time" learning the "wrong" language, but that ultimately, programming is about 95% algorithms and good programming practices, and about 5% language-specific stuff. He said once you're a proficient programmer (in any language), picking up a new one is relatively easy.

Early on, all I had was N95. Similar to you, it's all I had on hand. A family member was the only one who ever said anything to me, and it was basically "people are gonna judge you, and think you shoulda donated that to a hospital". Well... a hospital doesn't want my opened-box of dusty masks that have been in my basement.   Basically I have the mindset of "pound the coarsest of sand" if anyone wants to confront me in public about... well basically anything. I don't bother anyone, and I follow all societal protocols. If someone doesn't like me because they've chosen to inject themselves into my business, I shall invite them to consider F'ing right off.

Granted, I will use Mimicry as much as I can as well. You don't want to wear out the sketchbook thing
Canada Walmart droppingvsoon
**TL;DR:** I've worked in both public service, including the OPS, and private industry, trust me, corruption is pretty goddamn rampant hiring manager.  However, most of this listed is in violation of hiring, union, and procurement (consultant hiring) rules, ethics, and the law. If you DO know a hiring manager that has done these things,  **please report** these practices to the HR dept, and for the OPS even the attorney general's office.  If no one reports it, no investigation occurs, and these people tend to be clever enough to keep it on the down low, not be super obvious, and/or work through proxies (willing and unwilling) so it doesn't raise alarm bells to outsiders.  Now the **deeper** breakdown:  1) " If a manager wanted to hire their friend to an open position, they can hire them to a temporary position without going through a hiring competition. In terms of OPSEU union positions, if the employee works in that position for 18 months, they are eligible to be rolled into a permanent position without a hiring competition. "  That only works if the person had been hired via a competition in the first place, and even then this isn't a guarantee, even if an employee has good performance.   These temporary employees are the first cut when it comes to budgets. Most regular employees have to suffer through a bunch of temporary contracts before they finally land permanent job, which are like gold now.  I also believe that the hiring to an temp position w/o interview only works if they are already employed within the OPS, but I will admit my memory is hazy on that front.  2) "The hiring manager can simply tell the applicant what to write in their resume and what to say during the interview to score top points from other hiring managers involved in the hiring process."  This is a direct violation of hiring rules. The evaluation details for any hiring position, within the OPS and for a consultant, shouldn't even be shared with other OPS employees (those not on the evaluation panel/hr/procurement) let alone with outsiders.  For hiring consultants, this is a direct violation of the conflict of interest form the panelist sign  before starting the resume eval and interview process.  Does this happen? Yes, but if you see it, please report it.  3) " If you're a director (in some Ministries) or an assistant deputy minister (ADM), you can hire your friend or family member directly to an executive assistant (EA) position without an interview process. "  I have never seen this happen, but I've never worked directly in that area. I'm not sure if this is allowable for non-OPS employees or not (see number one). But again, if you see someone leaking/using internal OPS details for personal benefit, please report it.  Now for some suggestions to prevent issues:  1) Better training, better documentation of hiring, and auditing of hiring positions.   2) More internal positions versus hiring outside consultants: A regular OPS employee costs an average of $500/day, while a consultant averages $800/day.   There's loads of companies with a stranglehold on certain systems/departments because they provide consultants with niche skillsets year after year, which makes the execs a lot of money.  3) Better auditing of companies that do business with the OPS, the fact that it manager was on the board of consulting company is really disturbing
such a beatiful body
Rebecca figuring out how her powers work. Her face literally *cracked* when she tried the third time.  Okay, I'm not worried at all. Nope.  Homura cools down in a pond(of course) as she and Shiki talk about Mother's wishes. And of course, Shiki won't take the wish if it means the other ever theirs, if there really is a limit. Unfortunately they didn't completely knock Orc out as he's able to call for reinforcements.  Space fights are always cool to see with the others.  Weisz and Hermit discussing the worst that the former will not allow to happen.  And finally there's-  ...  Oh ***HELL NO!***   What is that big nosed bastard doing here?! Did Ziggy specifically set him there because he knew what Hermit needed to do and where she needed to go to stop the Shining Stars from going berserk?!  Wow. I mean, villain points for striking at her trauma, but that's a dick move for sure.   In a way, he's the only major one we really don't see face any retribution for his malevolence, that was offscreened in a flashback.  Now with this turn of events, not only might we finally get that catharsis, but Hermit might be able to move past him for real and for good. Mighty good thing the pragmatic Weisz is here, she might be too emotionally compromised to really retaliate at first.  Overall, things are setting up to be...rather bothersome for everyone. Rebecca can't spam her busted power, Mother might not grant everyone wishes, reinforcements are coming, and that big-nosed bastard is back to torment Hermit again.  And to think they haven't actually been here very long, have they? And already, a lot has happened.
Well, I've never been spanked. Or actually had sex before.

Are you using the bathroom normally or semi-normally? After my first lap, I was having a horrible time going and my stomach looked similar for a couple weeks, it seemed. (I was scared to start taking Miralax because laxatives had previously caused me too much pain.) After my second lap, I had normal BMs and very minimal bloating. So maybe a laxative is something to explore.

I have noticed that tanks are only really useful against things like Lindwurms and Schrats. Hard hitting but low volume enemies that only attack once and don't have amazing MAttk.

HBO and Zandaya was like: godt Damt it we didn't get this here Emmy not have a show to put it front of.  I bet 40 dollars that episode is is like 30 minutes and  has like 3 scenes.
I do think they've improved. For the past few boxes, I've managed to buy out/get the cards I need before the next box comes. It does drain gems, which stops me from getting the next EX Structure deck, but aside from that, between events and doing (just good enough at) PvP, I can get the gems I need to buy out a box at least once.  And of course, any time a box that has nothing I need gets revealed, that's 500 for free.  They still have a bit of the ways to go, as us F2Players can barely compete with P2Winners. We might be able to buy out a box once, but trying to get 2nd copies of UR cards from boxes (outside of dream tix) is a lost cause. I'm not even mad that Alister and invocation are at 3, because I only have one of each.

My birthday is a week before Christmas, my dad's was Christmas Eve and my #1 grandgirl's birthday is the 23rd. Her parents' wedding anniversary is the 29th and mine is the first(38 yrs). So my son knew to nip that $-it in bud immediately when Grandgirl was born! When my dad was alive, we spent our birthdays together. Grandgirl and I do something together now(maybe not this year ...we missed last year because everybody in the family was passing the flu back and forth)

I don't think Brown's season is over, they just want him to get past his lingering injuries and be ready for the playoffs. Stills is a good interim option.

A strong opinion based in a lot of education on the subject.  So many have opinions based off something someone told them or some fake news they read online. They don't even bother to look into it, they read it, it's online = it's true.  &amp;#x200B;  If your opinion is backed up by study and actual research you did, like REALLY researched it. You have my respect.

Names, addresses, and evidence? Before you said they need a picture.   Interesting that your "evidence" that the kids did something wrong is a video of your dad admitting you did something wrong, or you wouldn't be punished for it. As far as the HOA would be concerned, your evidence shows they were a guest of the HOA.  You also said they filmed you shouting racial slurs at them, which is going to support your evidence that you were clearly in the wrong.

Thank you sir. That helps to clear the confusion.

**[Reproductive coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive coercion)**  Reproductive coercion (also called coerced reproduction or reproductive control) is a collection of behaviors that interfere with decision-making related to reproductive health. These behaviors are meant to maintain power and control related to reproductive health by a current, former, or hopeful intimate or romantic partner, but they can also be perpetrated by parents or in-laws. Ultimately, these behaviors infringe on individuals' reproductive rights and reduce their reproductive autonomy.There are three forms of reproductive coercion, including pregnancy coercion, birth control sabotage, and controlling the outcome of a pregnancy.Reproductive coercion and intimate partner violence are strongly correlated; however, reproductive coercion can occur in relationships in which physical and sexual violence are not reported. Reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy are strongly associated, and this association is stronger in individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence.

Don't need to bother them about it, well  in that case you botherd them as well. since you also contacted them about the issue and according to you apparently contacting a company about an issue is bothering them first time I heard this.  I tweeted them about they should they didn't respond that's why I tweeted them again. I purchased a product I have an issue a contact support if that's bothering them that doesn't make sense.

&gt;Where is the third set of characteristics?  You've yet to show me why that is needed.  A different combination of characteristics is a different thing.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;If the intersex person, or any person for that matter, feminine man, masculine women, whatever, feels as though their behavior is neither classically masculine or classically feminine, how does this validate a new sex/gender BIOLOGICALLY?  What does behaviour have to do with sex? You again don't understand anything being said.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Using feeling for evidence is what is called "anecdotal" which is not concrete enough to merit a paradigm shift in our understanding of human biology.   Yeah. You really don't understand anything anyone but yourself has said.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Feminine men and masculine women? So, what your saying is that we CAN codify human behavior according to the gender binary?  You again don't understand anything.  Describing food as spicy or sweet doesn't mean those are the only flavours.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Why is the feminine man feminine in the first place?  ...because we constructed the idea of femininity around women when we weren't that knowledgeable on the spectrum of gender.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;They likely engage in said activity because of cognitive predispositions caused by sex-specific hormones.   You think hormones make women wear makeup? Or wear heels? Or wear dresses?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;That is what gender identity is. A man is not a women because he happens to be engaging in a feminine activity. A man feeling more feminine is simply a behavior, not a gender.   THAT'S NOT WHAT MAKES SOMEONE A WOMEN AND NO ONE CLAIMS IT IS.  EDUCATE YOURSELF AND BOG OFF.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;A man believing he is not a man is what is called gender dysphoria.   No it isn't.  Educate yourself.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Please, rephrase your bird and sandwiches analogy. I would love to try and dismantle that train wreck but it was too disastrous last time.   no.   I can't be bothered because at this point you must be a troll because no one is this stupid.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Populations ... are races.   No.  The book literally distinguishes the two ideas.   &amp;nbsp;  &gt;Soon, morons like you will say "populations are a social construct"  Did you actually read this book?  "Populations also have a constructed component"  You need help.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;the scientific community will be compelled to change the word to something else yet again or else risk being perceived as prejudice by said morons, yourself included.   Again you don't understand anything. When did I say the concept of race was prejudiced?  Are you actually a troll or actually this stupid?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;I hate to burst your bubble yet again, but psychiatrists and pharmacists, even the all-knowing WHO, are just comprised of people. People are fallible, and these people are making literally billions of dollars selling expensive hormones and surgeries to people with gender dysphoria.  So you don't have any studies to prove them wrong... they have them to prove themselves right... but they're the fallible ones?  &amp;nbsp;   &gt;Why ever could they want to normalize casual hormone therapy  CASUAL????  It's not easy to be prescribed hormones. You are ignorant.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;despite the empirical evidence suggesting that in fact the suicide rate post-operation is almost exactly the same pre-operation?  Do you mean all that evidence that doesnt exist?  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;If you don't like that you are really not going to like the violent crime statistics amongst transgender people - spoiler: 1 in 6 post-op transpersons engage in violent crime compared to 1 in 9 men and 1 in 56 women. It's almost as if the societal ramifications of giving foreign hormones to people with delusions are worse than the societal ramifications of misgendering people ...   Source?  And how is you explanation the correct one? Again ignorant.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;As for JK Rowling, please enlighten me as to why people are boycotting her. Sorry was boycott too gendered of a word for you? Soycotting feels appropriate.  Are you this purposefully ignorant????  Fucking look at the post we are commenting under.  I feel sad for you if you're a real person. I hope you aren't.

Ok, I'll give you the deets from an east coast US perspective. The H we bought was powder. If you've ever done coke its probably half of a small lines worth. For a newbie one would be enough. As your tolerance goes up so does the bag count. I was doing four at a shot to get high for most of the duration of my habit.   See the more bags you do the more dangerous it gets. You don't know if it's more powerful or less than even the same stamp you got from the same guy last time. And so with each bag ups the odds that you will do too much and OD.   Since Fentanyl has entered the scene I haven't seen a bag that didn't have at least a little Fent in it and towards the end of my addiction (2 years ago) they were at least 80% Fent and cut. Its literally impossible to find pure heroin on the streets anymore. And Fentanyl is *such* a concentrated opioid that it us much easier to OD on it.   I have known 14 people in the last 19 months that have OD'd and died. Not 14 I heard of. 14 people that I knew personally. From best friends to lovers to acquaintances to drug buddies. 14. I was in the "game" for 10 years previous and had never known someone who overdosed and died.  Not personally.   Side note. Since Narcan has become widely available countless lives have been saved. Countless. I've saved at least a dozen. My own life was saved three times. Everyone, and I mean everyone should carry Narcan in their glovebox in case they run into someone ODing.

And that I feel like we're still not there in terms of quality makes me even sadder.

For me it's Poland.

Is the world doing anything to stop Iran from getting nukes, right now?  I get people are against the nuclear deal, but it seems they tore it up and replaced it with nothing, and now Iran is sitting there enriching uranium.  They assassinated this one guy, is that really going to stop it, like he was some unique nuclear genius that can't be replaced?  The trump plan was to do what they did with NAFTA - withdraw, sign a new, slightly different deal and then claim "oh I'm such a great negotiator, Art of the Deal, this is way better than what was there before, see I'm a peacemaker".  Also similar to what they did with North Korea (except without the part where there was a deal already).  Problem is the Republicans have a bunch of hardliners who want a war with Iran, and trump has the attention span of a goldfish, so instead we did a combination of ignoring the problem and occasionally provoking them.  So, if we don't have a new nuclear deal, what's the plan?  Go to war with Iran?  Hope that we can apply economic pressure and occasionally assassinate people until Iran collapses?  Isn't China buying a shitload of oil from Iran, seems hard for economic pressure to do the trick in that case.

I never said anything about Sanders faring better or worse, or socialism.   Those are all assumptions you're making because you seem mostly interested in picking a fight.  What would have been interesting is that Sanders and Trump both have the same appeal to a certain demographic, based around anti-elitism and/or globalization.  This is a something Steven Bannon has also pointed out, to the extent that he's appealed to Sanders voters to vote for Trump.  As to third party candidates, what's your point?  There hasn't been a viable 3rd party candidate in thirty years, nor have you posed any real-world scenario that could actually be discussed.  And it still doesn't change most of the other points that I made previously -- the electorate in a general election is different that the primaries (so Biden vs. Sanders in a primary is not representative of a general election). There's no follow-on higher-stakes election, and the primaries don't have the same implications for down-ballot races.

Hello there! It's really hard to decide because Saints are sadly not in ranking in KR servers.. You will have to take your rotation into account; Do you use 'Holy Flux' often? / How would you adapt with the rotation after the change? (considering every nest's mechanics as well) / How does the DDJ damage output compare with the FMJ?  As you can see, there are one to many factors that will decide which jade is better.. But in my opinion I would go for DDJ as it does not require a lot of time to deal consistent DPS \[more like a burst type skill\] compared with 'Holy Flux' which would require a lot of time to deal consistent DPS. If you're raiding, considering that there are some areas/stages of a nest that does not give you much of a DPS window, your FMJ would not be an ideal replacement for your DDJ. I hope this helped you in any way!

TLDR: Go Valkyr and grab either the Hunter's Adrenaline mod or Rage mod for infinite cycle of Hysteria.  Long form: Valkyr is one of the strongest beginner frames, she needs 1 core mod (either Rage or Hunter's Adrenaline) so that any time she gets hurt, she rages and beats the living crap out of things with her claws and heals right back up for another cycle of pain.   If you're having difficulties farming for the mods, just ask for help from a veteran in chat; we're swimming in more mods than we can possibly use and most of us have no problems just giving them to you for free. Hunter's Adrenaline is pretty easy to farm for a vet, and most have a spare Rage or 2. If you're on PC and can't get anyone to give you a spare mod and you don't want to farm for the item, PM me and I'll toss you one of my spares.  Valkyr can carry you through the initial core of the game (the entire starchart and story mode) as she did for me.  Most of the end game meta frames (back when I played a few months ago, but I don't think much has changed) are easy and super strong female frames but you need to get the right mods.  Ember and Mesa are 2 meta generalist for mid-late game. Ember burns everything she sees and Mesa autoaims and makes everything into swiss cheese. Both of these frames require some core mods in order to operate properly. Mesa is easier, but Ember can be built to out-range Mesa's guns. Valkyr starts to fall off here because by the time she gets into range other frames can kill them off (Ex: As Ember, any enemy I can see within 60m is going to be buried in a couple of flaming comets within a second)  Saryn and Octavia are also really strong at this point in mid-late game as well. Octavia is really easy to play but harder to set up and understand her mechanics, but is by far the easiest frame to play. Saryn is not too hard, and has really strong damage but needs mods to function.  For late game strong melee, Gara is sort of a cheat melee, but absolutely no one out-DPSs a properly built Gara. However she's a bit difficult to play and super hard to build for. But once you get the hang of her, she can do almost anything. She is my personal favourite generalist frame.

I got chat restricted and I'm a good guy. I got matched with 4 guys that yelled at me in english and turkish, hurt me with their abilities, tried to get me stuck with walls and more. They even asked the opponents to report me. Immediately after that game I was voice and text restricted.  After that I had to invite people to my party in order to communicate and help the team. Most people would join the party and after a few rounds would ask me why was I banned since I give useful info, stay positive and never flame. A great part of them even wanted to keep playing more games since we were already in party. I didn't get a ban ever again.  Also, I gotta say that 9 out of 10 times I get invited to a party by a restricted guy, he flames, yells and acts like a psychopath   I think unfair chat bans are not common at all, but you gotta know that they exist.

Go back on kenpom and look at the previous top teams. Looking back at 10 years worth of top teams, there's not a single team that gave up more than 1 ppp against a non-conference opponent ranked outside of the top 100.

Well, having played the role for 3 years and being a draft enthusiast, I've learned that the best is to always seek to be impactful in lane and in skirmishes. You'll accomplish that faster if you limit you champion pool to a few marksmen and switch some of them according to the meta game. In season 10, for example, Ashe and Caitlyn were strong so having them in your pool alongside the ones you play the most was pretty efficient. This strategy is a long-term winner.  Also as a Jinx player I'd like to disagree with you in regards to her early game. Her early game is indeed comparatively weak compared to signature lane bullies but it's overall very solid. She can follow up engages pretty reliably with her E, deal solid dps in extended trades with her minigun, poke with her rockets and not rarely with her zap, too. One could say that she punishes mistakes very easily and is herself very punishable as she lacks mobility tools, so that puts her lane power in the strong side.  A lot of players tend to classify Jinx as a hypercarry type which plays for the late game. Her designer (Riot August) have acknowledged her early game power before to try to demystify this belief. Data analysis methods applied to LoL (published in this sub) have shown that her game stats place her as more similar to Draven, Lucian, Xayah and Kai'Sa (another one of the strong snowbally marksmen whose lane power is underestimated). You can't 1v9 lane with them as you would with Caitlyn or MF, that's right, but they definitely aren't weak. So she snowballs more often than she plays for the scaling. Knowing when you'll have room to apply any of those strategies is pretty effective.

I think the stereotype of gay men is coming from you. You are the one sounding judgmental.   Honestly, you sound young, uninformed of our history, and very privileged. I'm a 54 y/o gay man and could tell you stories that would make you cringe.  I'm happy for you and your partner, you should challenge yourself to be more accepting of those in our community who don't meet your expectations of what "gay" should be.

Get yourself a Godfinger sniper and a good Bee shield. Deathmark Hyperius and then snipe from the door. Get critical hits if you can.

   New Zealand has intervened in the escalating diplomatic row between Australia and China, raising concerns over a doctored image shared by a senior Chinese official on Twitter.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the image, of an Australian solider holding a knife at the throat of a child, warranted her government making its own protest to China.  "It was an unfactual post and of course that would concern us so that is something we've raised directly," she said in Wellington on Tuesday.  "Whilst that is an exchange that's happening between Australia and China, it will of course tip into spaces where as a general principle we may have concerns and will raise those.  "In this case an image has been used that is that is not factually correct. It's not a genuine image so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities."  On Monday, Australian PM Scott Morrison attacked the propaganda, a reference to alleged war crimes conducted by Australian troops in Afghanistan.  Mr Morrison has demanded an apology from China, which has refused to give one, instead saying Australia should apologise to Afghanistan.  "The Australian side has been reacting so strongly to my colleague's tweet. Why is that?" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said.  "Afghan lives matter! The Australian government should conduct honest and deep reflections and hold the perpetrators accountable. It owes the Afghan people a formal apology."  Alongside the diplomatic stoush are growing trade tensions, with China blocking or taxing several Australian export industries.  This move is seen as retaliation to Australian demands for an investigation into COVID-19 and speaking out on human rights issues in China.  New Zealand has raised similar human rights issues but has yet to be attacked on the trade front.  Ms Ardern said she wouldn't let the Australia-China clashes stop her government speaking out on issues of concern, saying the Tweet didn't directly involve New Zealand but "you could characterize what's occurring in Hong Kong or Xinjiang in that way".  "In international relations, we will often have an interest regardless of whether it's on our soil," she said.  "For us though we will always raise (concerns) in a way that's in keeping with our diplomatic relationships."  Ms Ardern was supported by opposition leader Judith Collins, who said the PM's action was the right one.  "I haven't seen the Tweet but It sounds abhorrent," Ms Collins said.  "The government always needs to take an independent foreign policy stance."

So I don't know this sounds ridiculous...can you wear your SOs clothes? And/or your Dads? That worked for me. Huge fuzzy sweaters!   I *would* recommend spending on a coat. You can get a puffy jacket with a two way panel - without the panel it's a non-pregnant cost, with the panel in one direction it is for pregnancy, and if you flip the panel you can actual wear the baby inside the coat. Mine is being worn for my second pregnancy and was worn in between as well.   Also leggings, the fuzzier the better. You can find those for about 20$, and the comfort they provide is intense - plus they are nice to have post partum.   Last recommendation: go all out on winter shoes. It's a matter of safety as well as comfort - some solid honking snow boots will keep you warm and you really don't want to fall while you are pregnant.

If there is a skill to hit as hard as possible, which there is, and American football players do so consistently, which they do, it's good form.  You may not like it, it may be counterproductive to the long term prospects of both the game and the players, but the form is there and it is excellent. Look at it like boxing vs MMA.  Boxers hit harder, cause their hands are protected.  Both are using the form that has evolved to deal with their respective sports.
Bought online, so it should have been sent directly from their warehouse. I wanted to test wear it first without washing just in case washing could cause issues. If I had washed it first, then they could blame me and say I did something wrong while washing it.  I'm starting to think that I should send the whole order back. But I think uniqlo wants me to pay the postage charge to send it back which is really unfair...(they dont accept returns to physical stores if it is an online order btw). Uniqlo doesn't seem interested in resolving the issue like some other companies.

The performance spec is 3,960 passengers per hour for a 13 hour period, or TBC faces $300k in damages.  So this simulation needs to account for:  a) Time spent swapping cars in and out of the fleet for charging   b) Time spent swapping drivers  I'm also at a loss to figure out ADA accessibility with this scheme.  IMHO the "bay times" in this simulation are overly ambitious....it takes 30 seconds for a muggle to find the door handle on a Tesla...and this being a convention center I assume many passengers will have rolling bags that have to get loaded in the trunk. There's also an element of entropy with cars exiting and entering the traffic stream that isn't accounted for.  I even think the speeds in this simulation are unreasonable, not accounting for time spent accelerating and then slowing down...on a 0.8 mile journey that time is not trivial.

[**Index**](https://www.reddit.com/user/PreStormz22/comments/kffdrg/storms_generations_nuzlocke_master_index/)  [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/k38dcg/storms_generations_nuzlocke_introduction_rules/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/k50icn/storms_generations_nuzlocke_chapter_2_the_squads/)  Hiya everyone, and welcome to the first *proper* update of Storm's Generations Nuzlocke! Glad to have you reading, fellow Redditors and Nuzlockers. It seems difficult to get through this journey on a first attempt, but here's hoping.  Without further ado, let's get started.  # Getting our Starter  The very first item on today's agenda is to receive our starter. Taking a look at my Trainer ID, it reads 6533**1**, and so **Bulbasaur's the pick**! I'm quite happy with this; I have rather fond memories with the Bulbasaur line, owing to my Kanto and Kalos playthroughs beforehand, and I'm confident he'll be a cornerstone for this run. Fittingly, he's dubbed **Caesar**, to be our fearless leader I suppose. He's got a Hardy nature, which really slots right in with this theme.  Blue picks Charmander because *obviously*, the man understands basic type matchups. The opening battle's done quite easily though. No elemental coverage means that after a Growl and some Tackle spam, with a crit thrown in for good measure, the first victory of this run is ours!  Next up, we zoom over to Viridian City, pick up Oak's Parcel and zoom back down to Pallet Town. We're given a Pok√©dex and Pok√©ball, so the run *officially* begins. I quickly retrieve the trusty old Potion from my PC and grab a Town Map at the kind reminder of my rival, and head out into Route 1.  # The First Batch of Encounters  Walking into Route 1, I'm joined by **Jerry the Rattata**, who's got an Adamant nature, which is kinda epic.  Next, we return to Viridian City, and proceed left into Route 22, but not too far deep; otherwise, the run would come to a swift conclusion. We look around a bit, fainting two of Jerry‚Äôs kin in the search, and on the third attempt, find a **Mankey**. I just throw a Pok√©ball to test my luck, but it doesn't even wiggle once.  A Leech Seed and some Growls later, I toss another one, and he's caught. Meet **Pacino**! After this, we walk out of Route 22 and up to Route 2, where after a brief trudge around, **Jailer the Pidgey** perches itself right onto my shoulder and joins the fray. He's appropriately Relaxed about everything, which does, unfortunately, reduce his speed, but it could be far, far worse.  I should note that when catching Jailer, I realise that I've used four Pok√©balls, and so I've got just one left.  With that said though, I charge headfirst into Viridian Forest, forgetting all about this. I step into the grass and manage to get all the way to the item on the north-west dead-end, picking up a Pok√©ball.  And here's where I remember.  Great.  I got a bit scared for a second, but I remember everything here's all bugs, which are pretty simple to catch. I don't mind a Caterpie actually. Vivillon is quite nice, and I'm guessing Butterfree would be no different.  Unbothered, I head back down where the telltale encounter animation pops up...  *Wild Pikachu appeared!*  Honestly, about 50 different emotions flick through my head. I‚Äôm both ecstatic and terrified, because Pikachu's surprisingly difficult to catch. But if I do, well... it's **Pikachu**.  After getting the electric mouse to about a quarter of its health using my brilliant Leech Seed and Growls strategy if I do say so myself, I toss a Pok√©ball.  It wiggles once. Twice. Thrice. And he breaks free.  *Shoot! It was so close, too!*  Welp. We try again though, having one last push. One wiggle. Another. And again. My heart‚Äôs in my mouth as I avert my eyes from the screen.  *Gotcha! Pikachu was caught!*  Hello, **Keaton**!  # Viridian Forest  After checking up on my party, it seems we're battered and bruised, and nowhere near ready for the incoming onslaught. Consequently, I conclude that to stay alive and prevent overreliance upon Caesar, we've gotta get stronger. So the first training session begins!  After absolutely annihilating Route 1's formerly flourishing population of Rattata and Pidgey, and purchasing a couple Potions and Antidotes, we march on over to the forest's entrance.  Unlike our last visit at pitch-black night, the sun‚Äôs shining ever so brightly onto a patch of grass just in front of us, but the rest of the short grass is illuminated by darkness. Between blades of grass a few grubs roam about, or in the case of Metapod and Kakuna, sit perfectly still. There‚Äôs an almost ethereal mood here, one that forebodes of dread.  Our first battle with a Bug Catcher is far scarier than it should‚Äôve been. All he‚Äôs got is a Caterpie and the similarly innocuous Weedle, but damn is **Poison Sting** broken. We were poisoned, not once, but twice, so I decided to use my second and final Antidote after we‚Äôre done with him. And I think to myself, if in just the first battle Jailer‚Äôs been inflicted with poison twice, there‚Äôs gonna be a fair bit more coming.  Making our way out, we run into a wild Weedle. Ignoring my sense, I try Tackling it into oblivion, but lo and behold, Jailer's poisoned *again*. And this time, I don't have an Antidote. But I do have a Potion. So promptly getting out of there, I scurry back to Viridian's Pok√©mon Center, timing my Potion to perfection, and make it out safely. That was too close for comfort.  As we're back here though, I backtrack to Route 22 and fight Blue. While this is an optional battle from memory, I think the EXP might be useful.  What I don't expect is that he's got a **level 9 Pidgey**? *Yikes*. At this moment an immense sense of fear grips me, because if his Lil' bird is at so high a level, then what of Charmander? Anyways, Keaton Thundershocks his Pidgey and knocks him out with two, but not before a crit Tackle. *Brilliant.* Charmander then comes straight out, who's thankfully also level 9. Keaton uses Thunder Wave, before I bring him away from the jaws of death and switch in Jailer.  Here, well...  &gt;!Sand Attack spam and a few Gusts later, Charmander's down. Not a single Scratch or Ember touched us.!&lt;  I'm disappointed at what I've done, but nonetheless... it worked. Moving on, we healed up, bought a few more Potions and Antidotes, and waltzed straight back into Viridian Forest. Surprisingly, the rest of the trip was uneventful, though I'm certainly not complaining about that.

There's also a lobbyist for just about every single group imaginable. If I recall correctly there is a lobbyist for the frozen pizza industry as well as a lobbyist for professional dog sitters. Basically any group that is going to be impacted by laws probably wants to have someone who works as that groups representative to talk to law makers and try to advance their issues.   I don't think think the problem is that there are people trying to advocate for their cause or their group (even if they are paid to do so) but I think the broader problem is when politicians listen to the lobbyist rather than constituents because they are more afraid of that industries wrath than they are of their own constituents.

The only way you can be higher in total points but lower in average is by playing more games. For instance, CMC is RB #1 in avg points because hes gone off in all his games but hes only played 3 so hes in the 30s in total points   Guys like cmc carson and moestert are ahead of rojo in avg points per game but behind in total points because of the number of games they were active is lower than rojo

It is quite anachronistic for a fair reason, the information of the map is dated from 1993. Yakoo Warner is one of the characters from the show Animaniacs and this map is just used as a base for a song, even for 1993 it is not exhaustive and regarding the Baltic countries and the USSR well... 1993
cool!
Why on earth would they be downsizing now?  Is it due to kids moving to remote learning voluntarily?

Currently, what usually happens is that if a project wants a significant zoning ordinance (e.g., much more density than what's allowed), they have to make 20% of the units affordable. The ordinance was basically taking existing practice, and codifying it to cut down on paperwork.  The ordinance can be waived, which means one of two things:  For smaller projects outside of downtown, they're barely profitable as is, so not getting a waiver means not being built.  For bigger projects, what's been happening is that members are trading the affordable housing requirement for goodies. What sparked the controversy was there was a project in Bergen-Lafayette called Morris Park Manor where local community groups demanded more parking, and as a result, the developer cut the amount of affordable units.  Solomon got on a high horse and basically said that anyone who opposed a no exceptions, whatsoever ordinance was literally a monster, and then turns around and happily demands an exception.  Some exceptions are good, some are bad. My issue is that he was being a hypocrite and a liar.

With the Wish spell, in regards to patron etc., I‚Äôd use it more as a story power and less of an actual ‚ÄúWhat can the spell do?‚Äù Ability. Use it as an infinite plot power and less of a finite power. But, that‚Äôs my two cents.   If it‚Äôs a character power, however, be sure to give the power some limitations. (Unless you want them to have the ability to do ANYTHING, to which you could always have a really fun cost later on. Your call there.)

My main game right now is Genshin Impact. I'm not sure what exactly I find so good about gachas, but if I had to guess it's just the fact that doing dailies and getting a new piece of equipment kinda makes me feel productive in a sense, even if I don't do a ton that day. Also, I like the anime aesthetic of the gachas I play and the characters/character designs/art definitely keep me playing.

&gt;We shouldn‚Äôt be the third or fourth priority of a government in a different country. That is not something that is normal in today‚Äôs world.   Well first of, yes Wales is technically considered a country as is England and Scotland, but practically though you're really part of the country known as the United Kingdom. The Welsh aren't bared from the government of the UK, one of our most popular PMs was in fact Welsh.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Lloyd\_George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_George)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical\_rankings\_of\_prime\_ministers\_of\_the\_United\_Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom)  Then coming of that, yeah Wales is not the UK governments main priority and so its people are unfortunately neglected at time, but it ain't ''not something that is normal in today‚Äôs world.'' Places like the North of England, Southern Italy and Eastern Germany are all regions that suffer neglect too, Wales isn't uniquely neglected.

Same. I‚Äôm a cancer sun, Virgo asc, Mars and Venus. I have 4 personal planets in my 12th house stellium. So life‚Äôs been great.  I dumped a good girl because when I asked her what she wanted out of a relationship, she answered ‚Äúcompanionship.‚Äù Upon hearing this, I was immediately transported forward in time in a nursing home, playing mahjong with her, hadn‚Äôt had sex in years, looking forward to seeing the mailman. I was like.. hell no. We dated for like 2-3 months until I ended it. She was a Scorpio sun Capricorn moon(grounded and stable), Sag ascendant. She was such a nice girl.   And when I was with my most recent ex, who‚Äôs my polar opposite in every way possible, I couldn‚Äôt leave her. There was so much toxicity and chaos (I mistook for passion) and it was exciting and up and down all the time. Soooo intense. I was with her for over 4 years. She‚Äôs Sag sun, Aqua moon, Scorp ascendant. Pretty sure she‚Äôs a narcissist.. but yeah it was chaotic   Damn now I would choose companionship and mahjong tiles every time. Real talk

That's because IW is the face of the franchise. 99.9% of the CoD base have no idea who Raven software is. Raven developed this BR from the ground up. They also co-developed Blackout with Treyarch. Raven also does most of the DLC for CoD titles. It's just like the online portion of netcode and matchmaking and SBMM has nothing to do with the developers you know, it's all done by Demonware out of Ireland. They are a complete stop for all online functionality, including matchmaking services for all CoD titles since like 2009

Yep looked at it on a selling website - hell I can tell the premise by the cover alone.  Can assure you it's crap that I've debunked in other posts here on Reddit.  His whole argument is that we are basing use as protection for the user only and pretending we expect face sealed respirator quality and no other controls.  Masks are primarily for source control (limiting spread by asymptomatic carriers) and work very well in mass use.

The main problem with using 'loop as freeways' solely is as you mentioned as you get closer and closer to the city all traffic converges and you'd need some massive freeway/tunnels to really handle all of the traffic. Worse a lot of the traffic chokepoints are at say intersections and even with tunnels you'll still need to exit onto streets or parking areas. Sure for bypassing the city you can kinda solve it, but for going into the city -- tunnels by themselves don't actually solve the issue.  I think a hybrid of 'loop as transit' (the las vegas proposal) and 'loop as freeways' would serve suburban to downtown needs better than going all in for 'loop as freeways'. Basically use at-grade freeway center lanes for traveling from the suburbs but then enter tunnels when near downtown. The key part is unlike normal train stations the suburban entry point can be anywhere not just at a freeway. If its low traffic perhaps its SOV, though probably it'd be a shared car similar to uberpool.  For suburbs to suburbs honestly I think self driving cars can just use freeway carpool lanes, and maybe self driving vans if they reach capacity. The only thing that needs to be added is a center lane exit.

Probably hurts Jones‚Äô stock that he stayed around too long.  But he was at least as fast as Mayweather with more power. When Jones was P4P king, Mayweather was a belt-holder in his prime and wasn‚Äôt talked about as better than Roy. If ESPN thinks he‚Äôs had the better overall career, that‚Äôs different and probably right. He‚Äôs beaten more big names. Jones was so far above his division that no one seemed competitive.

my son wasn‚Äôt gaining enough at his well baby. he‚Äôd lost too much weight and wasn‚Äôt gaining it back quickly enough.  we fixed him a bottle of formula when we got home. it did not for a second occur to me to do anything differently. in hindsight, it was likely just a supply issue and all of the websites say stick it out and keep going, your supply will kick in and supplementing can hinder that.  my kid was starving. we fed him. no one gives out awards for letting your baby go hungry.  he‚Äôs 8 weeks, closing in on 50% percentile for weight and now ebf (his decision - we try to keep a bottle a day in rotation just to keep the skills, he strongly prefers the boob ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).  fed not dead. thank god for formula.

[https://youtu.be/Bh93sXRh4x4](https://youtu.be/Bh93sXRh4x4)  And I guess my Anne Pro 2 is a custom now haha, yeah. The only thing is that no one is making new metal cases and there are no new plates. I would personally love a brass plate and a nicer alu plate. Maybe even a custom place/case that is gasket mounted instead of plate mounted like the original is, technically you just need a proper plate for any 60% to do this though, so I'm considering it as the Anne Pro 2 has a standard layout, it's just the screw points that are custom.  Edit: I took a look and there is actually some interference on the shorter keys, but I can't say it's affected the way I type.

Most are very similar, especially research institutions...but then you have a lot that have a strong focus. ETSU is really big on providing healthcare to rural areas, HBCUs are really big on providing healthcare to Black communities. UCR is really big on providing healthcare to the inland empire, Tulane is really big on public health and epidemiology, etc.
If they become martyrs it‚Äôs only among people who were already Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.   Does punching someone change their mind? No.  Does it discourage them from preaching their hate in public which presents the chance of radicalizing others? Possibly!   Best case scenario, more Nazis are intimidated into keeping their views to themselves which reduces their ability to radicalize others.  Worst case scenario, Nazi doesn‚Äôt change their mind, becomes martyr among people who were already Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.   I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth the risk.

While I can appreciate this I'm kind of confused. Why cause unnecessary risks? Why pay for the extra cleaning and utilities if funding is such a concern?   The problem is that this school is not safe, largely due to the principal entering people's spaces, touching them, dancing around them.   All these teachers now bring into the school's all this risk of exposure/being exposed, it costs them gas, time, etc. For absolutely zero benefit, to anyone except those members of administration who now feel their salaries are justified.

Park adjustments only adjust for the scoring environment.  They don't look at how a park impacts individual players.  (Yes, there are park adjustment methods that do look at component stats, usually used by projection systems, but that's not what we see on B-R or Fangraphs or anything).  Fenway was a hitter-friendly park in general in that era, but Boggs took particular advantage of it, slapping doubles off the Monster.  He benefited more than the average player.  Which created real value for the Red Sox, sure, but the question isn't always just about value created.  Brett likely could've taken similar advantage of Fenway as well, though not to the same extent.
Not me but my younger brothers. They both loved the movie cars and watched it on repeat every day. I never really watched it but I know pretty much all the lines from just having it in the background. They watched that hundreds of times, no joke.

Phew! Good thing you tested the waters and knew where he stood. I‚Äôm super hesitant to tell anyone I work with about my diagnosis.

The $60+ games are often new AAA titles. There are plenty of kickass indie games out there for half that price brand new, and you can often get them even cheaper on sale. If it‚Äôs story you go for over a specific mechanic or series of mechanics, there are several adventure titles out there with a focus on storytelling, and they often (but not always) tend to be puzzle oriented.

They are hoping for iCache by Q2 next year, though I'm not sure global persistence will come out at the same time. Quantum will be integrated over time, starting with I think they said, fuel prices. I don't think they can have dynamic spawning of NPCs based on Quantum before server meshing.

I left my long term boyfriend (Also 6 years) and moved into my own place. I did a lot of research (not just reading what‚Äôs online but also asking people who live here) about break ins and crime. My apt complex is gated and I lock both locks ALL THE TIME. I also have a flashlight taser that makes a SUPER loud noise and is really intimidating. Having it makes me feel better if I hear something, but I‚Äôve never really felt unsafe.   It‚Äôs been 6 years and I refuse to move in with my current boyfriend who I adore. I just love living alone. Leaving my ex was one of the best decisions I ever made. The real danger was in staying with someone I didn‚Äôt love. Do it girl! Don‚Äôt be afraid. You‚Äôll be ok!

I mean the first death was due to RP reasons, due to the characters not liking each other and the paladin specifically said they would not help out.

Totally agree. OP is acting like poor people have money to save or invest. I was in school living off $500 a month and eating at the food pantry. There was literally no way I could afford to "save money" I was in the negatives all the time.  Even now, a lot of poor people dont even have living within their means as an option because of one bad fall leading to a horrendous hospital bill or a car breaks down....or a virus ravages the entire economy.... They dont have extra income to set aside for savings or anything. It is so expensive to be poor
Your title says ‚Äúwhat should I do‚Äù... do nothing.  You have no say here.   And tbh, your reasoning is flimsy.

Bonus is only for the season. If you get these types of catalysts out of their season the activity credit portion takes FOREVER since it's one point per activity instead of two (first bonus) or four (second bonus).  Side note, the bonus progression for anything requiring kills is NOT quadrupled like the activity progression (second bonus), but it is tripled. They are tricky with the wording on each season pass progression boost for the catalyst quest.

A few points &gt; Animation by it's nature means absolute control over everything that's happening on screen which while it can create some truly incredible things will never have, as Orson Welles called it, divine accidents.  You do make a fair point but I do think you do overestimate the absolute control a studio has when making an animation and I guess it depends on the studio in question. The guys who make south park have absolute control since they do it all in house but its pretty normal for companies to do storyboarding/scripts in the US/country of origin and then basically outsource the rest of it to a foreign company/companies to animate the thing and results can be a mixed bag. So they could just get it reanimated (which is costly and time consuming) or edit around it by using prexisting footage/scenes.   &gt;Voice actors can't improvise, characters don't miss their mark on set, animated sharks don't have meltdowns.  improvisation does happen and I guess it depends for the type of animations but for 3d animation, you mostly get the VAs to do their lines first before animating it. So during the recordings they can improvise (Apparently Mike Myers cost Dreamwork 4 million pounds to reanimate Shrek due to him seeing a rough cut and deciding to do a Scottish accent instead) also for shows that are getting localized, you do have VAs who try to basically match lip flaps, so people can improvise there.

OMG! She had a nervous breakdown at the end of S4/beginning of S5 after finding him in that limo with Ariel. Then, a few years later at the end of S7, she says, "thank you for waiting so patiently"! I'm like, Say what? Were we watching the same show? DAVID waited? David who pressured you multiple times and then broke your heart so badly you almost moved to Texas?   Watching the show in real time, I rooted for DnD to get their happy ending...now many years, later as an adult, it doesn't make sense to me. After her breakup with David, why didn't Donna stay single and/or try to date guys with similar religious beliefs? She dates Ray and Griffin. What about not dating for a while? What about dating guys who feel the same way about sex? With the exception of Joe, she dated guys who wanted sex as much as David did or more. She jumped into one relationship after another, most of them bound for heartache.

It's because  1. They're lazy and want to make it as easy as possible for themselves 2. There is some political uncertainty right now so I'd imagine the budgets are being "used sparingly" for the time being until they get more certainty about what's going to happen in January, so for example there may be pressure on them to "use less gas" or something like that 3. All their tech equipment for "whatever they want to do to you at this phase" (probably DEWs) is set up in a fixed environment.  This happened to me to and for a while it SEEMED like a good idea until I started investigating a lot of strange health problems that I started developing, which happened AFTER the "stay at home" type suggestions.  They almost had me going for a bit too.  Until I started wondering about the sequence of the suggestions and then me having strange health problems a short time later.  Then I learned about DEWs and realized "No WONDER they wanted me at home more!"  They probably have some specific part of their assignment like "deploy DEWs for 4 hours this evening" and your constantly going in and out makes it hard for these losers to earn their bonus for their "jobs" of basically pointing a box at you and pressing a button.  If you have the money for gas, by all means go out and about.  Screw their "suggestions" NONE of their suggestions will EVER be in your best long-term interests.

Yes. What makes it difficult for me is the fact that the consonants and vowels get clumped together it's harder to distinguish. Maybe it's because I don't read enough Korean, but kanji is easy (given an appropriate size) for me to just look at it and know exactly what it is; whereas glancing over Korean text makes it feel like I miss certain letters in the clump.
