What state are you in?
Which is?
That a good price difference. Did you end up picking and signing a contract? I’m getting the same modules as you are. 425w L-G8.2 with AP QS1 microinverters.   My initial concern was the DC to AC ratio being 1.41 but I don’t think it would be too much of an issue especially if I had to possible pay more for different inverters.
IIRC 3a threads have +/- 0.0015 tolerance. Did you mic in multiple spots along the length of the thread? Tool pressure or part deflection could cause a slight variance in thread depth/major cylinder diameter.
Can I just ask why? I'm just curious on why? I usually do in twitlongers or big discussions but this is just a joke tweet. Genuinely curious though

And on a more personal note...  I'm sure I'm not alone when I say that this past year really... kicked my butt. Although I like being perceived as a bot or other formless entity, I am sadly only human and I haven't had nearly as much time to devote to r/nosleepfinder as I would've liked. But despite that, I've been absolutely *blown away* by the outpouring of kind comments, generous awards, and heart-felt personal messages. Knowing I've somehow been able to help others find a little entertainment, a little escapism, in these extremely trying times with my silly hobby makes my heart feel very full. I can't thank you all enough for the extreme kindness you've shown me.

Nope because you make the same retarded threads all the time switching from reddit account to reddit account. I can tell by the way you type you're the same person who made the, "anavar preworkout," thread.  You ask all these dumb questions that can be answered by doing actual research.

Sure, but look at all those CTE cases from concussions in professional football players, it's even been found in high school players. She may have actually saved his life 😄
yup, the update removed the prior packs and didn't put anything back, and I'm assuming u can't use the Store as well, correct?
Unfortunately no not at all. 😭😭

Thank you so much, this really helped a lot! I hope you have a really good day!
Imperialism as a word is not exclusive to Marxism and most people will understand similarly to how I have explained. However, this being a sub on communism I’ll concede that the Marxist connotation should be understood.  That being said, China is arguably capitalist at this point and one could argue that Chinese expansion into its peripheral, conquered territories and also its finance relationships with African and South American countries constitutes imperialism even in the narrowed Marxist definition.

Viper one ways post 2.06 will be even more viable. I already use one ways for most maps but the enemies before didn't care about decay. Now they have to consider the fact that if they touch my smokes AND I see them? They're 100% dead. Viper is supposed to be a lurker anyway so most of the time the teams have no idea where I am so taking those shots now will be easier.   With the toxin buff the ult is buffed too since before I had to lurk for a second or two before taking shots at an enemy to ensure I get an almost free kill but now with the instant 50 decay they enter and they're dead. No more bum rushing me! :D  Viper gang rise up *tears of joy* Also learning lineups for just the default sites should be good enough if you're just starting out.

It doesn't feel like a final episode because the ending is not what was planned.  The production of CloverWorks (Wonder Egg animation studio) was disastrous, it pushed the limit of all its staff to animate of the episodes, to the point where the producer of Shota Umehara was hospitalized after bleeding twice in the production of the last one episode. ¿What am I going with all this?  Episode 8 was an UNPLANNED recap episode due to lack of time, the last episode we saw was actually the episode planned to be the 11th.

&gt; I never had any problems with flat areas and often used a plane as a debugging shape, so that sounds odd. Could you elaborate that at all?  Sure. As far as I've read, it's a known issue with Dual Contouring + QEF that when normals are close to parallel, the solution to the QEF becomes less well-defined. I guess the intuition is that the QEF is meant to find the approximate point of intersection of a bunch of planes, and when those planes are all basically the same, there are a lot of approximate points of intersection.  That's just my understanding though, and as I consider it, I'm actually having more problems with curves and edges than I am with flat bits. So I guess I'm way off.  [It's mentioned in this tutorial under the header "colinear normals."](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/dual-contouring-tutorial/) There are some solutions proposed, but they're all in terms of modifications to the QEF stuff which I have no idea how to implement.  As for my own implementation, I've certainly tried it without the clamping (though 'clamping' is a misleading term I think, I'm not clamping the QEF solution to the cell but instead switching to a simpler algorithm) and it looks very odd. [Here's a gif where I resize a sphere.](https://i.imgur.com/7gg6SD0.gif)  The edges of cuboids still have the little chips taken out of them as well.

Actually I didn’t deny that. Of course boomers create a lot of the music I love even now. Indie artist Robert Pollard of Guided By Voices is in his early ‘60s and still pumping out great music that captures the ears of his small but loyal cadre of Gen X fans. I was just pointing out The Eagles as an act that embodies the worst tendencies of the boomers. Although fictional, boomer Jeff Lebowski appears to agree with me (“Ah man I’ve had a really bad night and I hate the fuckin’ Eagles.”).

Therapy is what you're looking for.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I badly need to lose weight and keep up with keeping my apartment clean (I live on my own). I know to eat better, I should cook, and I want to, I know to keep my apartment nice I need to clean and I want to, but I lack motivation. I step away from my work computer at the end of the day and just feel so done, I end up staring at my wall or ceiling and ordering junk food.  You've established a habit of shutting down after work ends.  I suggest breaking it by doing something radically different.  I'd personally try walking outside and sitting somewhere to experience the outdoor environment, even if unpleasant.  Once you're in this space, tell yourself out loud what you're going to do when you get back in and spend just some amount of time doing it.  Even one minute is fine if that's all you can give. The idea is to focus on making progress through small victories.  One minute of chores you mean to do is always better than zero minutes of chores.  Build on these victories while being kind to yourself when you stumble and "fail".  Just focus on your next small victory and give yourself credit for it!

Spongy, fluffy and delicious, beghrir is a Moroccan pancake made from a very simple dough of flour, wheat semolina, and yeast. It is most commonly known as thousand hole pancake because of its unique texture riddled with multiple tiny holes. This classic is traditionally served with honey and melted butter either for breakfast or a snack.

Well, I am sorry, that there is a language barrier. Should we continiue this conversation in my native language? Probably not.  Since you dont value my insight on the difference between police training in the us in comparison with germany, france, the UK etc - do your own research.   Its pretty difficult to explain, due to all the differences in our education systems. You need the highest degree of highschooleducation to apply .  Becoming a police officers in germany means obtaining a bachelors degree in policing at an university combined with practical training like someone who wants to become a carpenter. Both are at least 3 years - but you would do both at the same time (the last one is why you get payed during your training).   After there is one year of beeing employed in the "Bereitschaftspolizei" - those are big units of 100 Police Officers  who are used to secure soccergames, demonstrations or in areas where a high police presence is needed and to support local police if they need the manpower. After that you ll join a local police department. So thats 4 years of training. (At least thats the way in my state).  Is this superior than the training police officers get in the US?  Last but not least: German police is using deadly force 5-10 times per year. Meaning people getting killed. Thats about as many videos uploaded on the Youtube Channel PoliceActivity per month.

Dahang has always had a full-time "real job", completely different than gaming, and one that should pay a few times more than being a Quake player. He's set.  And I think rapha is set too. Not by working in anything Quake-related, because let's face it there's only a handful of positions here and they are all taken, but rather as the best Quake player in history he can easily be a consultant for any company making a game with an esports side to it. Which, if you think about it, that's pretty much every big PC game.

That's really interesting, but I do have one point on that comment that I disagree with. Actually, I don't totally disagree... It could be true some of the time. But it could be the exact opposite of true some of the time as well:  You state that giving feedback increases insecurity.  I think for a lot of people, not getting feedback increases insecurity. Now, I'm older and mature, and I'll generally just move on. But for a lot of people, not getting feedback means overthinking everything. Since they have no idea what's "wrong", they start second-guessing themselves. Was it the joke I told? Was it my opinion about the news? Was it the car I drove? Was I awkward when he touched my hand?  So I think a lot of people actually feel more secure when they get good feedback. It can settle a lot of those other insecurities. But the key is that feedback needs to be good... And I think that's where your comment about feedback increasing insecurity makes sense. Bad feedback will increase insecurity - Make them self-conscious about something they can't change or feel they aren't good enough for anyone.
Loooorrd, don't remind me... I  just realized the other day that The OC is now on HBO Max (I was *devastated* when netflix got rid it -- and by "it" i mean ONLY the original series, not the reboot... how does that make any sense at all??) so needless to say, I've been binge watching that the last few days and let me tell ya, that show went **haaard** on the early 00's trends... and I mean ALL of them... fuzzy, bubblegum pink newsboy caps? Check! Generic grey sweatshirts cut up to make a whole new super girly short sleeved top? Check! Tube tops and off the shoulder pieces layered *on top* of long sleeved shirts??? Check!! Something kitschy on literally every garment such as a unproportionate satin bows so thin it just droops and loses all shape except for the long ass tails that hang about 12 inches? Or how bout a flower made of the exact same material as the hideous shirt it's sewed on to so it looks more like a growth of fabric than some lovely foliage detail? CHECK!!!   But perhaps the biggest offender of all, would be mama Kirsten Cohen's sandy brown hair riddled with chucky 2 inch sunflower blonde highlights placed EXACTLY ACROSS from each other on either sides of her part (because looking as far from natural as possible was of course, the essence of all early 00's fashion. duh). Then top all that off with crispy ends separated into no less than 65 sections which are all SWOOPed as fuck at nearly 90° angles, so as to achieve that hella tight "just purposely spent 2 straight hours daubing the world's driest hair with a balloon" ~lewk~   Yep. The 00's trend-fatigue is *REAL* on the OC lmao those stylists do NOT fuckin play... Shit, I'm not even half way thru S1 yet and those style crimes have already been committed *multiple* times over 😪   So in conclusion, being that I was privileged with the life-hauntingly firsthand knowledge and experience of being a teenager during the early 00's, it is my qualified opinion that this will go down in history as being the most atrocious, most hideous, ill-conceived, poorly-executed, conceptually substandard era's in fashion of all time, by *FAR*, and I highly doubt any trend or era that has yet to come in the future will ever even come *close* to being as appalling as the 00's were and I will absolutely die on that hill.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Dave’s financial advice will set someone up for success. I think he blesses a lot of people with his work. I think owning a for profit business is not a sin. I don’t think he takes advantage of everyone - and nearly all of his teaching is free.  I think his organization overstepped in the marriage of Chris Hogan. They made a reconciliation plan for him and his wife. I think this is better handled in a local church.  I think it is awfully hypocritical to fire a pregnant single woman while keeping Chris Hogan on staff. Chris is no longer at Ramsey, but he was probably kept on a year or two longer than he should have been.  Obviously his theology isn’t perfect. He is a bit mainstreamy and self-helpy. His doctrine of church is influenced by Craig Groeschel and Brian Houston, which leads to some deficiencies. But his teaching on money and wealth is Biblical. Spend less than you make, save money, invest, have a written budget. This is applicable to 90% of Americans.
I hate it when people say "lowering barrier of entry/supplies cost/profitability" you're playing a game where bosses shit out 300k a kill that 300k is enough for a single set lowering the cost isn't going to solve anything.   pking evolved, people got better even if your sets where free you'll still get clapped left right and center also pking was never for the money it was for the enjoyment and fun and your epenis but this community got soo spoonfed by jagex that everything needs to make millions before they even try it out.   pking will die out, sooner or later not because the entry is too higher or cost too much but because of jagex incompetence to show up when they need to.   scoutbots are still an issue, cheat clients are still and issue even for pvmers single pkers have been BEGGING for the so called "single+" or a pj timer in singles so single clans dont run rampant but nope. let's add another fucking chinchompa in the wildy shall we.

There are already cards that are used by travellers that need specific vaccinations before entering certain countries. For example, travellers need to get an International Certificate of Vaccination of Prophylaxis for Yellow Fever.  This has been a program since the 60s,  has been effective, and has been and is widely accepted by almost everyone, for decades.  The few morons who have issues should be ignored and left to their own devices.

No, actually the change of someone Ryans age dying from it is 0.3% compared to the 0.0001% change of a blood clot (which isn’t always fatal), to put it in perspective 0.003/0.000001 is 3000, therefore you are 3000 times more likely to die from COVID than you are to get a blood clot from this vaccine. And that is why most countries have approved it, the benefits far, far, far outweigh the risks. Looks like your username was spot on /r/youfailedlogic101
Not sure if it will help but you can change the scale of the game which can make things feel a lot better in vr once you have it dialed in. Go to..

Now open that file in notepad and copy this in then save.   \[VR\]  fVrScale=80  &amp;#x200B;  Adjust the value to suit your preference.

He had a vault of songs like no other. That’s insane if true! I know those close to him had said thousands of songs, but 10k?! Woah!   I’m not sure the best way to release posthumous albums other than to assemble them in a way that would make each project cohesive such as chronologically in a way, maybe with his most close to being “completed” works. I’m almost certain Circles was his final project that was still a WIP at the time of his death, but that still leaves nearly a decade of material prior to that. I’m also a fan of Jimi Hendrix. The posthumous releases have been pretty good over the years, although Jimi had far less material in the vaults. It seems like Mac had maybe 100 possible albums locked up. That’s a lifetime worth of music... There are so many beautiful songs and heavy hitters in those vaults and I’d just love to hear it all. The leaks that have come out unofficially just prove this. I believe Mac would want his material out there based on what he said a few times in the past. I bought Circles and will gladly buy anything else the label puts out with his family’s approval. I know us fans want more. We always want more but in this case it’s not really out of selfishness but love. We want more of Mac Miller to remember his legacy by, to grow with it, and share it with our friends and sure to be the new fans in the future.

The mystique can be captivating. You listen to podcasts from former military and it all sounds so cinematic and noble. Officers who just found themselves as Top Gun instructors, SEALs who raced into action at the perfect moment, or SF who saved friendly prisoners from burning buildings. Never do they promote or interview the 90% who are permanently disfigured, emotionally or physically, from their service. And so the cycle continues and more young folks march to their doom.

Reminder to all apes, especially the poor ones. Retirement accounts are a great way to buy PSLV.

You'll get a tax deduction for contributing money to the squeeze.

Ask for the formal offer letter and start date. All of these you can get answer to just by contacting HR or whoever has been in contact with you. For me, personally, I got an offer 4 months before my official start date. That’s anecdotal so YMMV.   You could start the other job and quit like your said, but you’d be burning a bridge with them should you ever want to go there again.

I have no issue saying when I don’t like things for petty reasons. I also generally let people have their fun so I wouldn’t go into a post that asks what’s a movie you love and then shit on people’s choices, even if I disliked the movie in question. That’s just mean. But in a post about what movie you didn’t like? It’s my petty time to shine. lol  Thor may have been speaking figuratively, though he was still pretty literal at that point in the movies, and Erskine obviously didn’t know Steve would be frozen for 68 years, but it’s still odd that Steve didn’t age during the 2012-2023 years in the present MCU, yet suddenly does when they need to write him out. I guess we’ll see what they do with Bucky re: aging to see if they fully threw out that the serum stops you from aging.  I’ll also be upfront that I didn’t like that they had to throw out the entirety of Agent Carter for the Steve and Peggy Endgame ending. I really loved those two in the first CA, but I moved on because they weren’t in the same time. Plus I loved seeing Peggy grieve, accept Steve’s death, and move on to fall in love again during Agent Carter. Then Endgame erased all that and you can’t say it’s a different timeline because they had Daniel Sousa, who Peggy fell in love with on Agent Carter, say in his Agents of SHIELD appearance that he and Peggy broke up unceremoniously.  I just think Tony deserved to have his happy settled life too, especially since it wouldn’t require convoluted time travel to do it. I really love both MCU Steve and Tony and, to me, Steve had the clearer path to sacrificing himself to save the universe and Tony had the path to finally retire and just be Morgan’s dad and Pepper’s househusband.  Having said all of that, I won’t sit here and pretend I won’t watch any more MCU things because I strongly disliked Endgame. I just wish it was a better conclusion for the original core, excluding Thor who is getting to stay on longer.

I actually like that character, although he killed one of my top 3 I really respect Aethelwold. The man was in a lot of open fights on where he actually killed instead of being saved all the time.  His character perfectly shows a person that is willing to do anything to reach what he thinks belongs to him. Fight, deceive and carefully making choices. He was the reason of why the danes lost. Killing Ragnar lead to Cnut leading which lead to him losing against the saxons thanks to his hardheaded way of thinking. I love/hate Aethelwold.

I have a bunch of 4x8 beds. I fill them to about 20 inches deep. I use cheap fill I have sitting around for the lower 8 inches and then fill with quality garden soil / compost mix.  There's a local place that has a fairly good garden soil with 30% dairy manure compost for $55 per yard. When I did my main build I remember they charged $65 for delivery.  You'll want to consider some perlite / vermiculite if you get a fine soil because it will want to cake and compress on you mid season. I mix a couple inches of perlite into my boxes to keep the soil porous.

You can cry all you want about what white ancestors did to black ancestors to make you feel better about yourself. The fact is if "white boy" isn't a slur then "black boy" isn't a slur.   Why don't we just condemn insults based on race on both sides. Or would you prefer to remain a hypocrite?
Amen!
I mean, Hornets were guaranteed to be in every race. Jungle Jumpers had to be in the top 16 of 20 marbles each qualifiers, which I feel is slightly more impressive than the top 16 of 16. Jungle Jumpers have also DNQ’d 4 times, so if we go off points in actual races, Jungle Jumpers have 9 from 6 races.

Yeah I don't think this is all that complex. Men kill the most because they are the most violent. They are the most violent because women sexually select for a certain degree of aggression in order to have themselves some protection from battles they personally don't want to fight.  If you ever have a general complaint about men or women, you should point your criticism to the opposite gender for selecting for that attribute in their partners.
They’re not defective, it’s called brake fade from overuse of the brakes on a long decline.
I think it should be higher, and logistics wouldn’t be nearly as hard as described because 40k has absolute insane recycling tech. In a bunch of books, whether it’s in hives or the under decks of ships, it’s said that everything consumed has already passed through another person. So air/water/protein, you name it, it’s been recycled back into use.  plus like, that size also indicate it should be more. Humans 40k arent planet or even moon bound. with artificial gravity/tractor beams being a common thing you would have people able to live on orbital stations across the galaxy.   with that said, the setting limits itself with the great great majority of humans in 40k never going off their home world. One of the main recruiting tools of the IG is for young people to ‘see the stars’. in a bunch of books too, you even have humans on wealthy worlds debating if Xenos are real lol.

To be fair this is a technology and human experience issue. We make technology and it is often used for good but often evil as well. Think swords, pikes, domesticated horses, bows and arrows, gun powder, electricity, nuclear power. Guns are a thing now and always will be.   Generally speaking the issue of self defense has and always will be this: "Do you have the right to have legal access to effective defensive tools and do you have the right to defend yourself with potentially lethal force?" If both of those answers are  no then only law breaking citizens will posses the appropriate tools for inflicting harm, if the answer to both those questions is no then the logical jump is that law enforcement will do it for you. But does anyone trust the united states local and/or federal government to protect you when someone is trying to assault you in your house or by your car at night?   Being the agent of your own self defense is a the most basic of human rights that have allowed us to not be exploited by governments or criminals.

Condensing slightly for the important parts. Just a complete and total failure by DCF.   The Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate identified a multi-system failure prior to the death of a 14-year-old Fall River boy with special needs.  The Mass. Department of Children and Families reportedly began investigating the family for substance use and abuse and neglect of the children less than a year after they moved to Fall River. In October 2017, DCF removed the triplets and a younger half-sibling from the home, the OCA said.   The triplets were living at a group home in Mass. in early 2020 when DCF began the process to return them to John Almond and his girlfriend, who still lived in the one-bedroom Fall River apartment, the OCA added. “The decision to reunify the children with their father and his girlfriend was a serious error that was compounded by the pandemic,” the OCA wrote in a release.   On Oct. 21, 2020, emergency crews responding to the Fall River apartment say they found David emaciated, bruised and unresponsive, as well as Michael suffering from similar indications of abuse and neglect.  The brothers were taken to a nearby hospital, where David was pronounced dead. Michael was hospitalized for several months but survived his injuries. The younger half-sibling who was also in the home appeared uninjured and physically unharmed, the OCA said. John Almond and Jacyln Marie Coleman were indicted Friday on charges of second-degree murder and neglect of a disabled person resulting in serious bodily injury, Bristol District Attorney Thomas M. Quinn III announced.

go go gadget Streisand effect  the original article from January: [New building namesakes faced tax evasion case](https://www.westernfrontonline.com/2020/01/29/new-building-namesakes-faced-tax-evasion-case/)  &gt; In accepting a 2004 deal that saw the business partners’ entwined corporations plead guilty to felony tax evasion charges and pay over $36 million to the government, the judge said his only misgiving was that Kaiser was not personally indicted. Prosecutors attributed this to the difficulty of extraditing Kaiser from Cyprus or the Bahamas where they believed him to be living at the time.  the plea agreement they wanted to suppress: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6682015-Plea-Agreement.html#document/p1/a546847  super happy to see journalism students at my alma mater doing this.

I don't think it actually is a strawman and that's why I am a little concerned by it. In you very next comment you say that "It is the assumption that Jews are the only barrier to peace and that this isn't a complicated issue" and in that very statement you seem to be conflating Jews with the state of Israel.  Really what it is saying is two things.   1. We do not want to sell weapons to governments we know are committing violent human rights abuses. The NDP opposes weapons sales to Saudi Arabia for the same reason  2. We do want to use some economic power to oppose the illegal settlements in the west bank. The existence of those settlements are clearly a detriment to peace and an example of settler colonialism.  I really genuinely don't understand how either of those points could be antisemitic

Thats a big false.  Remember the famous Nimitz video?  For a while none of us knew it was real.  I had a huge argument with a friend who was calling me a fool for believing it, unsubstantiated.  I knew it was real because of the discussion surrounding it.  People had painted a likely hood that you could believe or not. &amp;#x200B;  This could totally be real and is worth considering, especially considering some of the top comments here.  Don't dismiss ANY of this stuff too soon, theres just no point.  The more thats on the table, the better.  Unless its kooky shit.

Next time you’re with your keyholder have her keep you on edge with the vibrator on low while you tell her your dirtiest fantasies and the most humiliating punishments you can think of. Obviously do not cum during this time.   Afterwards have her pick a number like 20 or 30, whatever she’s feeling, and that’s the number of points you need to earn an orgasm. You can work with her to assign points to each of your fantasies/punishments you told her, or let her decide. The more something pushes your comfort zone the more points you’d earn from it, ideally. That way you don’t necessarily *have* to do tasks that challenge your limits but it will get your to an orgasm faster.  Alternatively you could do something more simple like roll a six sided dice and that’s how many orgasms you must give your keyholder to earn one of your own.
I *feel* like it means something, I’m genuinely just an idiot looking for help lmao.
That idea was one of the most ludicrous of so many ludicrous things in the game ...  1) The US Government was much smaller and had much less tax money available (and a major Depression was just then starting)  2) Politicians  had their pet projects (and their own constituents to appease) and they argue endlessly about the limited money.  Projects take YEARS and with many deals to work out.  Bureaucrats involved would takke even longer.   It was businessmen in Chicago who actually funded the real  Exposition.  3) There was such a tight game specified Timeline (Wounded Knee with 16 year old Booker was late 1890 and the Exposition started EARLY 1893) - Such a project as 'Columbia' would be a massive undertaking (even with 'Columbia' downsized to be a tiny fraction of the game shown size) and  that would bankrupt several years national budgets.  4) Unproven Technology - laboratory tricks arent enough to justify proceding with spending millions.  "Subsidies' usually are a small fraction of the money involved, and the rest has to come from somewhere else  (and private financing has a huge amount of complications and delays).  .   .

In the documentary, Demi says how after her OD she calls up her drug dealer to take back her power, to have sex with him when she's in control. She then says it just made her feel worse.   I feel like that's what's happening here. She's recreating it to gain the control back, but this isnt the way to do it. I have a feeling when she's genuinely stable and happy, she'll look back on this era and realize its a little too intimate and exposed.

The only real difference is that the HD versions had an interesting, if empty feeling open world to collect extra stuff &amp; a different final boss. If you're not interested in getting the 360 version (this was 2007, so the PS3 version may have sucked) probably get the PS2 or maybe the Wii version. I think the PSP version may have had some performance issues, but I could be wrong.   There was also a DS version. It was a fun, but overall below average 2D sidescrollers with missing levels &amp; cutscenes, they also added a bunch of minigames. Interestingly, the DS version used 3D models for cutscenes, rather than 2D cutscenes. These models were similar to 3D models used in console game, suggesting the perhaps use of 2D animation happened late in development. That would explain why they look rather stiff &amp; off model the in console game.

Memoria with 4 mechs can only repair one per round is true, but the dreads also have a 16% chance to miss both shots, thus one will repair without any damage being dealt.  The odds are as following  36% for 2 hits  16% for no hits  48% for 1 hit  Meaning there is only a 20% chance that letnev only does 1 “real” damage to Nomad.  Multiply that out, 5 rounds per damage dealt, approx 1 tg every round, you end up with a lot of tg.

I'm a CSSE major also and took BEARTH 318 with Robert Turner when I had some credits to fill and nothing in CSSE I could take. I was just looking for something 300 level and above that didn't have any prerequisites, but it turned out to be a fun and interesting change of pace and honestly I had a great time. Involved lots of interesting info, some experiments, field research, and a couple field trips. I hadn't taken a science course since high school so that was kinda cool, and Professor Turner is a great dude.  Edit: I should mention, he knows that people from all different majors take that class because it doesn't have requirements and caters specifically to those students making sure that it doesn't require any knowledge that is like specific to earth science majors or something. A background in high school level science and a college level work ethic should be more than enough to get you going, but it's not that hard.   Also, I don't know how well this class would translate to online so I would recommend waiting until we're in-person again.

Options trading strategies make my head spin- you’re right in that there’s no way to know who is owning them.  From what I can tell, though, deep ITM calls are a “bearish” strat: http://www.optiontradingpedia.com/free_deep_itm_bear_call_spread.htm  (Deep ITM puts are bullish)
It exists so I-frames are bound to AGI and not your Equipmentload, that way every point in Equipmentload lowers your Stamina regen which makes many Players dont go for 69,9% all the time like in DS1 or DS3 where you have 0 negative effects of doing so.
did it! there are a lot of people saying they upvote but they dont. would you return the favor on my lasts posts?
Anybody saying leveling 1-58 is half of the content is a casual who isn't even playing the game anyways, so your opinion doesn't matter.  People who actually play the game love having more new players because it means we can actually do things that require groups (which is nearly the entire fucking game).  If any of the new people coming in because they can buy a 58 boost keeps playing it means there are MORE people that you can play with in this *massively multiplayer* game.
Oh no.  Anyway...

and that’s all you need. It is an incredible design with beautiful fitting music. I love how it transitions from the awe of seeing such a beautiful creature to the rage of confronting the Great One that has been keeping Gehrman captive this whole time. It’s pretty sad since Great Ones are sympathetic at heart, and Flora (the Moon Presence) seems to just be trying to fulfill Gerhman’s wish, but accidentally made everything worse. The story told by each Bloodborne boss is astounding.

More like if you leave your tv on 24/7 with static images all the time don’t buy one. Plenty of people didn’t get the warranty and have no issues. Burn in was more of a concern on the older models. Newer versions like the CX have lessened the issue. Not to say it still can’t happen, but there’s a lot of fear mongering about burn in whereas if you use your tv moderately, you’ll be fine.

Curious where this rumor originated?  I’ve been seeing it around the various social media outlets, and I know it’s 110% complete horseshit, but I’m just curious where this garbage started?

It feels weird to say but the moment I realized I didn't have to drink is when I stopped.   I come from a family of alcoholics and I just can't remember a time in my life when alcohol wasn't a big part of my family. My parent's marriage dissolved rather messily with a lot of drunken arguments involved. My dad was not a fun person for awhile. I can say he never physically abused us or targeted us kids, but he did often yell at my mom and has said a couple things that have taken me forever to start getting over. It ultimately lead to a bit of trauma and people drinking gives me way more anxiety than it should. I would drink occasionally after that but never that much. I hated being hungover and dislike the taste of most alcohol. I drifted more towards smoking weed and had my own set of problems with that.   Had a friend(later boyfriend) at work mention he's never had a drop of alcohol in his life and it really made me think. Didn't occur to me I didn't have to do it at all. Never drank again after that. Dropped smoking too but that was way harder for me. Just passed my 1year mark of being 100% sober.   I feel like it's worth mentioning that my dad really ended up turning around. Once my parents got out of that marriage, he found my stepmom and is in a better place. I called him to ask him a question about cooking chicken. We chatted for awhile and he apologized for multiple things. Honestly I'm just glad he's happy and moving forward.

My original point was that there was no need for the reaction you guys had initially. That was the point. Never said he was right or wrong.   You completely refused to respond to 90% of what I said on that topic, so yeah I don’t think it’s worth my time. Also, I’m not trying to hide in my DMs. I’m not here for the internet points like you so having a normal conversation 1:1 didn’t seem like too foreign a concept to me.   Anyways, have a great rest of the night. And get back to work! There’s loads of other covid articles that need sharing
Yeah I think you are looking for more of a trucking simulator thank star citizen tbh. A game where you can haul cargo back and forth undisturbed is what you would like to see.

Absolutely normal for most people.  It's utterly physically exhausting to go through the stress and emotional anguish of divorce.  The absolute best sleep I ever had in my life was not the night the divorce was legalized, but the night 10 days later when he finally moved out.  Slept through like a baby, awoke totally refreshed. That year of divorce though, I did not sleep well, sometimes would wake up at 2 and stay awake for hours.  Only thing that helped me eventually get back to sleep was watching late night religious programming (because it's mind numbingly boring to me), or QVC type shows. I hear now that you can get audio of someone reading the IKEA catalogue, that sounds like a good safe sleep aid!
I also use Carmex (the lip balm, i like the stick version the best) for cold sores as well as in place of neosporin for small cuts and on pimples. The menthol gives me instant relief and i think it lessens the durantion. I think they also make an OTC cold sore treatment, but ive never tried it.

But what if a runner was heading home and another runnwe to 3rd. No one else on base. The runner makes it to 3rd, but the runner going home stops before getting home (because catcher has the ball) and heads back to 3rd. Can the runner on third head back to 2nd to free up 3rd?

Yes, sexual chemistry is super important so I wouldn’t want to wait an overly extended time period going through dating hoops only to find out we weren’t compatible that way. Agree that you kinda have to go with the flow and act when the time is right but before I even agree to go out in a date with anyone, I get a good idea where they are at in terms of expectations of sex and vice versa.
I only just learned that the digits of all multiples of three always sum to a multiple of three, and it blew my mind.  27? Sums to nine; factors into 3x9 312? Sums to six; factors into 3x104 2622? Sums to twelve which sums to three; factors into 3x874  It's damn magic, is what it is.

Firstly, I’ve known Catholic priests to attend secular ceremonies and bless couples who chose a civil ceremony. I know he’s entitled to his own beliefs, but they are his own, and not a reflection of the faith. If I had to speculate, he’s trying to manipulate you. A moral priest should have more of an objection to a non-believing couple marrying in a Church, than trying to manipulate a non-believing couple to do so.   You have said your piece, it’s not open to negotiation, and everybody just has to get over it. Let the passive aggressive comments wash over you, and kill them with kindness- “I can’t attend a non-Catholic wedding”- “That’s a pity, maybe we’ll see you another time.” “You need to get married in a church”- “We’ve booked out ceremony and are so excited about it!”

The entire Japanese legal system seems like some combination of Stalin's Gulags and Middle Ages style justice but done in a civilised fashion, LOL:) I researched a bit after it came up in a novel and I was like "Nah, that just seems way too extreme, can't be real...oh wait, it is. Huh!":)

Thank you! Like, if I’m sitting down to read something, my attention isn’t going to wander, regardless of length. Even if it is a 20k chapter and I might have to set it down and come back to it, and the page reloads, it takes me no more than 10 seconds to find where I was usually. The beauty of fanfiction is that there are no rules, and authors should feel comfortable posting gigantic chapters, even if some of it is fluffy nothingness or something that doesn’t necessarily move the plot forward. Who cares? If you like it, post it. There’s bound to be at least a few other people who’ll appreciate it, too. And if I’m subscribed to a story, that obviously means I think it’s well-written, so more is moar! Hit me with a 30k chapter! Do it!

He is not impressed.
&gt; when it infringes on the rights of others.   Right, and it's a big question of importance *what* constitutes an infringement of rights and what doesn't, and who gets to decide.   What you find to be reasonable may not be reasonable to all. A good example might be patent exclusivity for life saving medicine - reasonable people can disagree on whether it should exist or for how long.   My point is that, in principle, we all acknowledge some language should be prohibited. Most people agree on on the examples you listed, but people do find disagreement in places.   It's rare, to the point that I've never seen it in the "wild", that someone who claims to be pro-free-speech in principle is fully pro-free-speech; they often have the same reservations about prohibiting harmful speech.

We were sitting on the couch about a year ago watching one or his shows after dinner one night. I was playing with his hair and he asked what I was doing, so I said "just looking at your little grey hairs". They were in the front, he had greys in his hair and beard for YEARS. Evidently he never noticed them.
It's more than that, 2208 and 2209 in standalone are drop in replacements for a4098s, they don't have to resign that part of the board or add the extra communication lines required for UART. It was literally the least effort way to get stealth chop and tick the silent motors box for marketing.

Yes, and so I got a ditto instead of a much needed dark type. Hope there are also regular purrloin out there to get to 30 dark. My latest grunt was a fire one with houndour. But I got the Magmar which was the 2nd Pokémon of the grunt team as a reward. Somebody out there is having fun, but it ain't me ;-)
What a fucking loser.
I almost had a heart attack thinking this feature was designed with Excel formulas and not DAX with PowerPivot.

Someone here said "My local chippy has more revenue than NZS" and the joke is that they were actually right. Let them burn in the fires of their own incompetence.
His album has been playing on repeat since it was released, which is very rare for me because I get bored of songs easily. Seriously, he (and SM) did an amazing job.
She registered Let’s Go!!!!
I think you are stunning!
Yes it's sexy or yes I should get out more?
I don’t get it. Demons aren’t people so why would you tell a demon it’s ok to pass on and leave this world behind? Demons are evil spirits. Demons can possess a person but they’re not human.
I'm 80% sure there's a cockatiel or two in the background, i have 2 myself and their specific tone screams are very recognizable to me.
I don't watch anime on stream btw. But If you want to go to nyaa then just search spring song and find this name  [VCB-Studio] Fate/stay night Heaven's Feel III.spring song 10-bit 1080p(this is rip from the bluray)...
Yeah FB Cr7 was so bad for me, the one Sbc that everyone says wasn’t worth it that I actually love tho is ribery. Well worth the value to me, I did it with fodder tho and it only cost me 100k coins.
Would light English and Balkans be too little of a change? Presbyterian, H&amp;H Whiteknight, Balkan Saiseini are great.   Are you are burley smoker? Solani Aged Burley Flake and MacBaren HH Burley Flake are flavorful and medium in strength.  Most straight VA falls below the Medium range on the nic scale. C&amp;D Opening Night however is tasty with some kick. GLP Union Square is right there too.  DFK in your wheelhouse? Rattray's Stirling Flake and Hal O'the Wynd are great, but harder to find. Old Dark Fired is the standard, but I quite like Savinelli's Doblene D'oro for a Va-per-dfk, which again might not quite what you want.
OGR is set in 2008. None of the Ghost Recon games are set in the early 2000s.
I remember being at that crossroads and thinking either I am completely selfish and crazy or my partner is a lying toxic abusive ah. Turns out they were the problem not me, but it really sucks being at the point. For what it’s worth, as an Internet stranger, it’s him not you. And NTA by the way.

FGO can't be the first mobile game that's exceeded its normal lifespan while still being popular.  How do gacha game sequels usually work in Japan?  (It seems vaguely absurd to me to think that the answer is anything other than "The players all get a 'Good job, please give us your money in the future!' and then everyone starts from scratch in the new game", but I guess the question is at least worth asking.)
I'm CRACKING UP. I got this question last week and I was like "ARE YOU SERIOUS?" I gave up after like three things.

Responded!
Yep.  Everything you aree describing is tribal psych. Marketing takes huge advantage of it.   One side of the sociopolitical fence is driven by it - the side that thinks name calling and rhetoric and lies and making things up is okay, because SOUNDING like your tribe and protecting others who do is more important than the actual ethics of the situation. It's the basis of a certain someone saying "I can go put on 5th Ave and shoot someone and wouldn't lose any followers." Yeah, its true. One side hears that their leaders say or do shitty things and they circle the wagons and excuse and protect him, the other side judge the behavior and distance themselves.   It's no different in fandom. Their arguments change with the wind. Whatever sounds right for the moment. Lots of personal attacks and name calling.  All in the name of "this is what I identify with and so I have to defend it."  The thing that gets me is that "fans" and people online in general no longer seem to have or consider achievements or goals or values when they think about identity. It really seems to be a foreign idea to them. There's a lot of being anti expert. Constant character assassination of anyone who went to college or who has experience to present. It's always "Oh no! This person thinks they're better than me! My opinion gets to be equal, too!" So they look at whether someone sounds like they are on their side or tribe and present not being part of their tribe as lesser, which let's them feel better about themselves. Ask the average person online to finish the sentence "I am ...." and they'll now say "a PS fan" or "anime fan" or "gay" or "straight" or "Republican" or "Democrat" or "xyz fan" or "Christian." Always a club.  Not "I am on my way to getting my degree" or "a husband" or "father" or "the youngest NY Publishing Market buyer in the retail books biz ever (I was)" or "a literacy volunteer" or "moral, upstanding gal." No achievements or values or expertise. Just "Stuff I like..." And certainly not expertise because you'll be ridiculed for mentioning it as arrogant. There were always bad geeks, but we tended to be bright, progressive, educated and worldly, and far above all we were EMPATHETIC and treated people well. If you look at most Speculative Fiction you'll see that it's themes are extremely so. Very progressive. Spec Fic tends to make tribal groups out to be the bad guys. 1984 and Animal Farm are classic  examples. Religion and conservative cultural trying  to "protect the old ways" just because they let the tribe know who they are, and  Facists... all tribal thinking and always less concerned with the individual and actual ethics. Roddenberry Star Trek is the prime example.  I think a lot of us gravitated toward it and helped to shape it that way because we didn't fit into any group or tribe.  We were smart enough to follow high concept and story and spectacle all at the same time so could enjoy this stuff. Once Star Wars and the computer revolution brought all the high concept and visual high concept to kids and our culture started teaching it to everyone, Joe Average could suddenly "get" and enjoy it. It became a marketing phenomenon. And all of the typical fucked-uped-ness of humanity ruined conversations about it. Leading to everything you mentioned. It breaks my heart sometimes. When I was 14 I wrote to Isaac Asimov's Mag of Science Fiction and asked what I should read. I had exhausted the school and local libraries. Isaac himself wrote back, sent me two issues, and included a long list of his and his friends books.  My dad worked on Wall Street. I gave him the list and he ordered all of the books at a city bookstore. I read them all inside of 6 weeks and wrote to Asimov again. He responded by inviting me to be his guest at a Sci Fi convention in the city. I met all of the white-haired gents of NY Speculative Fiction. I wound up friends with Isaac and Janet Asimov and with Jules Schwartz of DC and few others, but especially them. They took me under their wing. Isaac wrote a letter to UConn convincing them to allow me to create a Speculative Fiction degree. The first one. I have a BA in Science Fiction.  Isaac was curmudgeonly and arrogant, but he EARNED that. He was an incredibly powerful intellect. But he also had that trait of the very intelligent that makes them sometimes stupid about interpersonal issues. I think that if he had Iived to see the internet and social media that he'd be TERRIBLY disappointed and confused by this stuff we are talking about. He ready complained about the American trend towards anti-intellectual and anti-expert bullshit. In a very real and understandable way it was anti-Isaac. Lol.   Ever read about the Fall of Rome? Public discourse looked a lot like this. Not just anti politician but anti educator.

While technically not a way for me to generate income, i will get to live for free essentially, i am building an animal shelter/ hostel project in Rosarito Mexico near San Diego. Many shelters fail due to reliance on donations, which is why i wanted the hostel to be a part of it as it will generate income and all profits will be donated to the shelter operations.  I plan to create a community garden as well, so at some point i will have free plant based meals. Entertainment will be free since i could just talk to the travelers that visit and the beach is a few blocks away.  I did buy the land of course so that wasnt free. Doing anything in Mexico is a hassle and takes forever so my frustrations have increased during this project but after its built, i SHOULD be able to relax. Income wise, im on permanent disability so im set. This also means i will be an unpaid officer of the non profit. [https://sanctuaryhostel.org/](https://sanctuaryhostel.org/)  Hopefully, this model becomes successful post covid and i can duplicate it in other areas. Wouldnt mind living in a different city or country every few yrs while also helping the local community and animals.

Hi there,  As I read your post, I felt your pain and I felt my own pain to know that you feel this way. I want to encourage you by telling you something. You cannot give another person the power over who you are. By believing your mother's abusive words about you, you are giving her the power to have the last word about your identity. Your mother gave birth to you, but she did not create you. Only the creator of something can give it it's identity. For example, only Apple can say that they created an "iphone". Only they have that right. You understand? God created all things and human being. He is the one who has the final word on what your identity really is. You are LOVED by Him! You are precious. You are valued. You were created for a reason. It was no accident. Everything about you was created on purpose and intentionally. God does not make mistakes, because He is perfect. I don't know if you believe in God or not, but I pray that you seek Him and learn more about your true identity. Your confidence, your strength, your hope and your purpose should come from Him alone. It's the only way to find true joy and peace. If you are interested in learning more about this, please let me know, and I'll be more than happy to share some things with you to help you become the confident woman you are meant to be. I'm praying for you!
If you drink, make a nice tonic by macerating the pith with a little sugar, pour a shot or three of clean vodka, and top with the blood orange juice. You could also add some seltzer if you prefer carbonation.  If you don’t drink, do this minus the vodka. It’ll have a salty, tangy, refreshing flavor. I’ve done regular oranges and it makes great drinks.

&gt;i'll ignore the x part and address the y part.  &gt; I'll just ignore whatever parts of your argument are needed for my point to make sense   Reductive at best, dishonest and stupid more likely....The only net-negative to online discourse I'm seeing in this sub thread.   My issue isn't that you took issue with my reply you absolute dolt it's that your "issue" with my reply is straight up invalid. Further anything you base off that criticism is moot because you can't seem to understand the original comment.  Regarding what I "expected" I could give two fucks if you ever replied to my original comment I simply felt it was important to note that in addition to noting fake shit meant for comedy, we should teach people to be more able to assess informations verity themselves. Ie "Teach a man to fish"   Like sorry for replying in the first place man you clearly don't have the brain power to have any type of nuanced discussion. You saw "but" got triggered and assumed someone was attacking your idea rather than supplementing it.
The full OTK would be 2x breeder on krush, then wrangler on krush, then leo for 3x 10/9 chargey bois.   Since it’s hunter, you can typically get enough chip in to not need that. I see the general game plan as watch posts + trueaim to deal with the early game, taelin/pokelt in the mid game to draw the big boys, then leo+krush(es) to finish. Ideally you’ll have some breeders and wranglers mixed in there somewhere for copies/buffs.

Answer: Tomorrow is April fools day.
&gt; I think they instead don't know and are trying to figure it out.  Thus revealing their presupposition that different sets of physical laws are *possible*, yes. And it's reasonable for us to adopt that same presupposition when we're talking about the notion of fine-tuning.  &gt; Possibility should be demonstrated not merely asserted though.  Already done. The demonstration lies in the absence of logical contradiction.  &gt; Is it possible that the total is more than 100? You couldn't say.  Yes, it's possible, in the sense that I have no information that rules it out.  &gt; Though I suppose we might be talking about actual possibility vs philosophical possibility there.  Maybe you're talking about epistemic versus metaphysical possibility, where 'epistemically possible' means 'logically consistent with the information available to us'. This is a weaker concept of possibility, but it's all the fine-tuning argument needs.
I kind of agree with the original tweet. I'm a huge aoc/bernie supporter but as a Midwesterner I know if my life falls to pieces I can get a job immediately and make 15 bucks an hour. Its shit but ill live. Not many other companies offer anything comparable for grunt work.

**INGREDIENTS, JIANBING**  * AP Flour (中筋面粉), 180g.  * Cornmeal (玉米面), 60g.  * Mungbean flour (绿豆面), 60g.  * Five Spice Powder (五香粉), 1 tsp.  * Salt, 1 tsp.  * Water, 420mL  **PROCESS, JIANBING**  For this recipe you will need a gas stove, detachable stove grates (to double up on), a metal spatula (to use in place of that sharp sort of spatula/knife), and something to help spread the batter.   For an alternative approach that's a smoother adaption to a Western kitchen, check out My Name is Andong's video instead: https://youtu.be/2eLbLEiW1Bk​  1. Mix the dry ingredients, then add in the water. Use a rubber spatula or egg whisk to incorporate the water and break up the clumps. Do not over-mix, but there should be no clumps remaining.  2. Heat up your large cast iron skillet to ~100C - medium high flame - then ladle in your Jianbing batter. Each Jianbing will use roughly a quarter of your batter. Spread it evenly, and if there's any missing spots, add a spoonful or two of batter to patch it up.  3. Once the batter is set and no longer liquidy (~15-30 seconds), crack 1-2 eggs, break them up, and spread them over the bing. Optionally sprinkle over some toasted black sesame seeds.  4. Wait until the edges curl up and the jianbing no longer sticks to the pan. This will take a bit. Depending on the intensity of the flame and residual heat in the pan (if making multiple), we've found that this will take at least three minutes, or up to eight. It can be a nice idea to adjust the position of the pan if certain areas are looking more done than others.  5.  Flip. Brush on your sauces and sprinkle on your toppings. Fold the sides over the toppings (we find it easiest to leave the ends open), slice down the middle, and stack.  **INGREDIENTS, TACO BELL MEAT**  We used pork belly in addition to beef because beef in China is often quite lean. We used loin, but feel free to use cheaper cuts like chuck.  * Beef loin (外脊肉) -or- chuck (牛腱肉), 400g; pork belly (五花肉), 100g.  * Salt, 5g; water, 30g. Adding and mixing the salt and water in with the beef meat paste at first will help it break down.  * Seasoning: 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp MSG (味精), 1/2 tsp cumin powder (孜然粉), 1/2 tsp spanish smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp Mexican-style chili powder, few cracks of black pepper. Pretty sure Taco bell doesn't season this aggressively, but whatever.  * Chopped oats, 10g.   * Slurry of 15g water chestnut starch (马蹄粉), 30g water, 1.5 tbsp tomato paste.  * Dark soy sauce (老抽), 1 tsp  * Water, 1-3 tbsp. To be added near the end of cooking.  **PROCESS, TACO BELL MEAT**  1. Dice the meats, then hand mince using a couple cleavers, ~5 minutes. We got this pretty pasty for this video, but you don't have to be as paranoid with this one as you do with a proper Chinese meat emulsion.  2.  Add the salt and water, mix well.  3.  Add the seasoning and the chopped oats, mix well.  4.  Add the starch/water/tomato paste mixture, mix well.  5. Medium high flame, fry the meat mixture and break it up as it's cooking. After ~8 minutes of continuous breaking up, the meat should be cooked. Add the dark soy sauce, mix well, and add in the water - how much water will depend on how water-y you'd like the mix. I added two tablespoons in the video, but feel that I actually could have added more.  **OTHER TOPPINGS FOR THE JIANBING**  * “Fire sauce" - mimicked with a mix of two parts hot sauce to one part tomato paste  * Sour cream  * Shredded cheese  * Diced onions  * Tortilla chips (would likely be better with, like, a proper tostada)  * Diced tomatoes  * Shredded lettuce  And while we didn't include this in the video (because Taco Bell doesn't use these ingredients IIRC), brightening this up with a bit of cilantro &amp; a tiny spritz of lime would probably make for the most delicious end result. Oaxaca cheese would also likely be a more delicious option than our mystery 'mexican cheese' mix.
I say everything is fine except get rid of the cooler and use the stock one you can keep the HDD since it looks like you want a lot of storage and buy a m.2 ssd or something with the extra 200$ you’ll save for not buying that cooler
People who buy 2 minute rice. What do you do with the 10 minutes of life you saved?
Just a heads up on how to argue with gun nuts, don't use "gun shows" just use "private firearm sales" instead.
Wait....  Ms Frizzle?
ooooooooooo
It doesn’t say FDE in the description, so my assumption is it’s not.
Nothing, price wise. It’s just a cool factoid that those of us on Reddit know.
I feel like you are comparing two vastly different things. Drugs, especially weed, is more similar to alcohol. It is really not that had for you and is regulated at purchase.  Harder drugs are different due to addition, which makes the comparison even more suspect.  Guns are more like a vehicle or something. They are useful tools but dangerous when used incorrectly or with malice. Cars and boats and the like are regulated a hell of a lot more than guns.  The thing I cannot wrap my head around is how the gun manufacturers have so brainwashed a bunch of gun owners into believing that any regulation is bad. Gun owners used to believe in sensible laws around guns. Do you need a 30 rd capacity? Why are people so concerned about background checks for all purchases/transfers? People who have CC licenses commit fewer gun crimes than society as a whole, and we have already gone through the state to get that.

Happy for your holdings, but you should NEVER disclose your full crypto holdings publicly. Others may target you for that. I'd honestly recommend deleting this comment.
Joe Kelly will be suspended for 8 more games as there's a drive into deep left field by Castellanos, that will be a home run. And so that'll make it a 4-0 ballgame.
Let's see some articles nit targeting Islamic radicalism specifically : (I don't know if this is how it is said in English)   State agents can not give their religious or political views   Every public administration must have a "secularity referent"    Cyber harassment and "cyber hate" must be fought Home schooling becomes harder and must be asked and given authorization by the state. (Before you just had to make a declaration)  Steps to follow if a public service is not being neutral about political or religious matters   And the list goes on and on    Now some articles targeting not Muslims but radical Muslims:    Polygamy is forbidden   Places of worship must justify that they are cultural places also every 5 years   People doing "Apology of terrorism" on social media or anywhere else will be held on record  I just checked this law called "loi contre le séparatisme confortant les principes républicains" contains 70 articles.
This is incredibly open ended but frankly it would probably not change too much.  20-30 years from now is 2041-51. By this time China would likely already be the world's largest economy and probably has invaded and annexed Taiwan. Xi, if alive, would be either in his 90s or 100s.  So what happens really depends on who is in charge, or if the Communist Party is still around (it probably will be.) But either way, if you're talking about China itself, then life would probably not change too much for the average joe. Government in China is very decentralized, and not too dissimilar to the switch from the Qing to the ROC to the PRC the sub national governments that do the daily running of the country would probably not change too much.
y'all should reconsider MedMen over SNDL

   Any predictions on what year we'll be able to get those sweet tax free crypto gains?

I'm not a lawyer, but I had assumed that someone goes through and verifies the claims in these things before they get filed? Some of the allegations in the complaint are just obviously, factually wrong:   &gt; DEFENDANT SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, CITY AND   &gt; COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, through DEFENDANT Employer’s managing agents,   &gt; discriminated and retaliated against PLAINTIFF for engaging in protected activity, as a   &gt; private citizen in excess of four years before she was elected through the democratic   &gt; process to the Board of Commissioners   The tweets were in 2016, and she was elected in 2018.

What does 11,100 mean?
their goal is to move the conversation away from bodily autonomy and to trivialize pregnancy.  you can always reframe your responses around the pregnant person trying to avoid being debilitated hospitalized and maimed  something that makes them lose their goddamn minds: point out that your dad can have someone (an actual real breathing person) removed From His Property, for no reason whatsoever, and the state will probably come do it for him, at taxpayer expense. and then make the obvious comparison to abortion. popcorn time!!!

This is exactly how i feel. Infinity is terrifying whether it's infinite nothingness or infinite existence. Emotionally i strongly feel as though there is nothingness most of the time but when I think more rationally i believe that the reality is something we as humans can't even comprehend or have thought about. Mostly because i think existence and consciousness is so complex. I'm not a scientist or a philosopher so take my opinion with a grain of salt but i truly believe that the consciousness is an incredible and complex thing that isn't just chemical reactions in the brain and is deeper than that. I'd hope for reincarnation as I think that way you live on forever but not necessarily the same each time. Even this would surely have to come to an end though? So I'm not exactly sure. I like the buddhist view but idk if i believe that. I hope you find some peace with this, i completely understand how you feel

Hi, I'm sorry your tinnitus got worse after getting the vaccine. I'm scared of that happening to me as I already have mild tinnitus (in one ear) that fluctuates. Has your tinnitus improved at all since posting?
I can barely think to type my response over the thundering stupidity of your opinion. If you can’t follow the simplest science, and don’t trust people in the know when they tell you things, you’re a threat to everyone else. And I’m going to so far as to say that you, yourself, ARE PROBABLY FUCKING VACCINATED. Of course maybe I’m wrong, and you’ve had polio, measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox, every flu variant in your lifetime, and all the other fucking diseases vaccines have all but wiped out. Jesus Christ, dude, figure it out.

Pretty fine. He hasn't really done anything I severely disapprove of, and he certainly hasn't been in a constant terror and embarrassment as I was depressingly accustomed to from the presidency over the last four years. There hasn't been anything dramatic, really, but that's partly the point, and as much as I'd like sweeping liberal reforms, I recognize that the congressional system doesn't really allow for him to do much more than he's done.
...bro?
&gt;Yep trump has been right the whole way! This was a particular genius take by trump, " when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done." He said this in February of last year.  There were not going to be any more cases if the Democrats listened to Don and stopped the virus from coming in in the first place. Which is what Don was alluding to.  Without Don, we don't have vaccines until 2025. He knew the science, he knew how to navigate through FDA bureaucracy and it is disgusting that Moderna and Pfizer refuse to give him credit. If the media was not so biased against Donald (who can ruffle a few feathers but is a tremendous man), he would be hailed like a Jesus Einstein. Smart and based, which he is. But alas - this is America and we do not want to give Republicans credit for anything good. Only Democrats (who are not bad people - but the mainstream bias is tiring).

Since you say you can clean it off, why not clean it throughly and see if that returns ? I agree with another poster that it just looks like something scratched your pot but I think cleaning it and observing would be the best option for a more conclusive answer.
Thats where i would cum too, all over your face, like a dirty slut
Oh my god, you just don't get it. It's super easy. You just build a bridge, connect a net to it, but where it should be under the real bridge, and then you destroy the net-laying one, and build the real bridge over the top! And if you need a net for the net-laying bridge, build another bridge below that one first.

That's good. Were the internships in web/software development? And what stack are you using? You're better off than some people I know who only graduated with school projects, they eventually landed C# jobs but it took forever to get them.  The CS concepts can be learned on the side, but it's not urgent, especially for web development. Just polish up your resume and portfolio.

I worked in hospital construction for a couple of years and in one office a guy had a hammer framed on the wall with a plaque that said “$100,000 Hammer”.   Somebody with a hammer in their belt climbed a ladder next to the field and got just a tad too close. Hammer flew out of his belt and straight into the magnet.

Its really not, WW2 Imperial Japan's war strategy did not at all include an invasion of mainland USA. They had a fraction of America's population and industry. Never mind the logistical challenges of shipping and feeding and supplying millions of soldiers across the pacific. They couldn't even bring down China and that was practically right next door
I would not be certain that the score fluctuations are from your mortgage inquiries, or if they would affect your mortgage scores. Mortgage inquiries will not affect your Fico scores for 30 days after the inquiry is made. Mortgage inquiries made in the same timeframe will only count as one for scoring purposes.  Where are you getting your scores?

Likes!  Torterra. Just everything.  Empoleon. Those tridents instead of the steel edges are so much more combat oriented than wild adaptations. Like it. Cape is cool Infernape. This is complicated. Using fur instead of fire looks cool. But using the fire like that looks like his martial skills have been honed to the point he can precisely control it.   Dislikes:  Torterra: legs are odd? Empoleon: the beak is flat? Do penguins have flat beaks? Infernape: colors a bit muted.
Not what I was hoping for (basically the deep dark, warden, and skulk), but it is still very well enjoyed
I’m not from the US, genuine question in what ways is TD romanticising living in the south? I think the scenery is beautiful but in my perspective it looks pretty rough for most people who just trying to live an average life.

Is there somewhere to look up all of that info on cars? Or do you just know from personal experience?
Bubbles are from making too much foam and pouring your milk too fast.  What is happening is you are pouring your milk to quickly and foam is pouring out with it.  It passes though the crema into the milk and then floats up under the crema.  You'll normally see the same thing happen when people have a good ratio of foam but pour to fast and you'll see the clouding happening around their latte art.
NTA
My interpretation of a dry drunk is someone who is sober but would rather not be. It might not be the case for all who choose that label, but those I’ve met still very much romanticize alcohol and treat it like this wonderful thing they’re not “allowed” to have, and therefore they believe they are missing out. They would rather be drunk, but they can’t be.   I think for a lot of people in other sober communities, the goal is to be happy in sobriety. Many here recognize they are not, in fact, missing out. They’re happy sober. Their perspective has shifted. They might even say drinkers are the ones missing out on life.
