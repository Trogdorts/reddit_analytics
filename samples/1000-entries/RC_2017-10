your heart beats fast when running to provide your muscles with oxygen because they are mainly the things burning calories. In EC it is adrenaline making your hearrt race. Your muscles are not doing anything like they would when exercising. I know coz i'm unfit but can EC for hours without getting out of breath!

You are arguing to argue, I don't mind a story, I don't want it to be so long I can't play for 60 minutes to start a player, is that hard to understand?

I think that's a bug, personally from a lot of campaign and a bit of custom battles night runners don't feel like a replacement for slingers.  Slingers feel far more useful for harassing units around your army and getting in that morale damage.(Some Skaven clan rats and a unit of slingers can make Kroxigores route with a good surround and focus fire, especially with a spell in the middle of them or sniping the lord.)  While Nightrunners are better at dedicated skirmishers, harass arches with them, force the enemy to draw units away and pepper them, and once they're out of ammo just use them to flank for your clan rats and break units.  I haven't really tried out the more expensive variants of the night runners, but I imagine they play the same but just a bit more annoying.  So, vs AI you can break up their army and possibly even pull half of it away with just a few nightrunners while constantly plinking at their health. Vs players they seem like an annoyance and way to distract/take away some of their micro or punish them if they're not paying attention.
Harp absolutelly.  Harp is a warrior of blood with broken heart. He does not fight for money, anger or glory, he fights for honor. He's so broken inside that is much more touching than Delany. Delany is a man of honor too but he plays in a different league.

No it is not open. Before we started to date she told me that if I cheat on her that she will never talk to me again and I told her the same. Her passed relationships ended because he guy cheated on her so I would think she would do that to someone because she knows how that feels. 
Wow, what a body!!
Well you got a pretty good laugh out of me so good fucking job lol
I'm not really asking how to do it, I'm just asking if it would be possible/make sense in a world.

2 posts in a row asking very similar vague homework-sounding questions.  People here are passionate about their work and love to share information but they aren‚Äôt going to do your homework for you!
Probably not, but 24 hours is doable!  You'd get Mind Controller to onyx(!) by the end if you kept up that pace fielding for 19 hours, and if you do it in the right spot (or just put in one last field at the end) you could pretty easily get Illuminator too. You'd *just* get Connector platinum by the end of it, and could get Recruiter platinum with virtually no effort on your part if it's prepped in advance.  The 3 extra golds is where things start to break down a bit. Spec Ops is pretty easy, but you'd need to have a lot of easy 4 portal missions in the same area to do it and still have time for your last two. Translator gold is doable in that timeframe, but would take up a majority of that time and leave you one gold short. I expect Spec Ops/Pioneer/Explorer would be the best combo, since doing Pioneer would inherently get you half-way to Explorer. It's plausible that Spec Ops/Pioneer/Recharger might be faster with some good key management, but with how temperamental Niantic is for recharging I'd rather just go for the thousand additional unique hacks.  I'd be astonished if it ever happened, but it is theoretically possible.

She is pretty amazing. I get her to close to 100% ta and she hits pretty close to dmg cap while also being somewhat tanky. Of course needs atleast 3 turns to get going. Also nice as you can choose if you want aggro up or down in combat. She is also pretty easy to use, as you basically just use her #3 turn 1 and if you dont need to never touch her again, which is very nice to attack mashing. And she cant lose her buffs as opposed to six
Could you let us see the data when you're finished please?

But the US states are similar economically developed. Ignore DC and you have GDPs/capita ranging between 65k to 30k dollars. In Europe ignoring Luxemburg you have GDPs/capita ranging between 79k to 1,900 dollar.   It's obvious that countries, that have such a low GDPs/capita aren't sensitive towards social issues, because they're not even first world countries, but emerging countries. Also the cultural difference is more severe, not only because of the culture itself, but the fact that those countries had until the 90s totalitarian governments, therefore they have experience with democracy (including minority rights) not even for 30 years now.   "Therefore to say "Europe is..." and than referring to those countries is a double standard. It's the same like looking at Singapore and say "Asia is rich"

You don't lose any vertical space if you paint the ceiling, and it just kinda fades away when it's painted like that. It also fits with the more modern look we are shooting for in the basement.

His dad was actually a contestant on the life-or-death game show *Wheel of Fortune* as a kid. When he failed to guess the puzzle, he was dumped into a pit of hungry crocodiles and Pat Sajak claimed the "i" in Firk's surname as his personal trophy. His son Martin, distraught at losing both his father *and* his vowels to that madman Saijak vowed revenge and has spent the last 15 years honing his skills with the blade and plotting the moment in which he is able to crush Saijak and his henchman Vanna White and reclaim the letter that is rightfully his.

Yup, I read the whole thing, but unlike the first analysis, the whole "crying triggered a crying triggering another feeling of being defeated" is kind of... odd and extremely forced. I mean, it's not some random crying but Goten's, who at that point of the series was meant to be a "mini-Goku" is the one awakening Broly. It's just too much coincidence, and also going by Occam's razor, it's just the "more fitting" explanation.

Those massive parking lots are packed with Schlitz Park commuters Monday through Friday.  It took them years to get agreement from their lessees to repave that big lot. Can you imagine the jockeying required to shut it down long enough to build a parking garage? Plus the impact to both Pleasant and Cherry during construction would be incredibly inconvenient for residents and commuting employees alike.
First, try using your controller in another game and try using another controller, this will determine whether this is a problem with the controller or the game. If it‚Äôs fine then try resetting your controls to default in rocket league. Also try reinserting your controller into its port if you‚Äôre on pc. Honestly, you should be posting this onto the tomshardware forums.
Paediatric intubation is *much* harder because of their differing anatomy, the risk for barotrauma is higher in kids, their soft tissues are more easily traumatised and they're easier to manage with less invasive methods anyway. Unless you need the tube because it's an asthmatic arrest, or because of developing airway oedema, ETT should be a very low priority in children. I would argue that paramedics should almost never really be considering paediatric intubation if other methods are available, and never electively outside of airway oedema.

If you have a melee build, just run under the dragon and put yourself behind his hind legs. He can't do the stomp attack backwards and if you aren't between his legs he can't hit you with the backward fire attack. Make sure you have something with stamina regen on and save some up as well. He will take to the air, and you have to sprint towards his tail, as when is done with his AOE, he will dro0 straight down. If you ran far enough you will be behind his back legs again. Repeat until desired results come.

10 Team, 1 PPR,  - I have a very young team, I am also not competitive this year. (Almost guaranteed to start 0-4 after my opponents Rodgers/Nelson stack on Thursday).  - **Trade:** Travis Kelce, Rawls, 2019 2nd (not mine, probably a mid)   - **Receive:** OJ Howard, David Njoku, 2018 First (Likely mid).  &amp;nbsp;  - Rawls is just being throw in since I would drop him anyway. It's either him or Clement and I'm probably dropping Clement for Marlon Mack.  - My TE's after this trade would be: Njoku, Jonnu Smith, and OJ Howard  - It would also be my **fifth** 2018 first round pick. (Mine which will be 1.01 or 1.02 at the worst, two probable mids, and two probable late).  &amp;nbsp;  - I realize Kelce is a great asset. I do have Mahomes, which would make for a great stack in the future. But Kelce will probably be at the end of his prime by the time I am truly competitive. Kelce is my second oldest player. (Luck is my oldest). Kelce has also only had 1 elite year as a TE in fantasy. 2014/2015 were decent, but nothing like last year. They also didn't have Kareem Hunt last year and Hill was a "gadget" rookie.

Phone screens still do scratch. Glass has a 5.5 mohs rating and is made from sand. Sand can and will scratch your screen. I've seen plenty of screens with scratched edges and fronts, even if the phones have cases. It's impossible to avoid scratches without a screen protector.  The reason you listed isn't a reason. Screen protectors are super easy to replace and they protect your screen. I always have and always will use a screen protector.

I know there's a French vanilla flavoured coffee that is available in fine grind and k-cups (not sure if it's in Tassimo but if anyone knows that please let me know!) that looks pretty similar to the other coffee packages but has a blue box behind the writing where the normal coffee has a red box on it. I can tell you with absolute certainty that that is not what you're looking for. The French vanilla cappuccino sounds like it should be what you're looking for, but I haven't seen it so I wouldn't be able to say for sure. 
4 is not more absurd than 5. It had dark, foreboding Spanish villages, dark lightning, forests, moody castles and dim lighting. Only a segment on the Island towards the last leg of the game does it begin to twist into a more RE5/6 action-esque chapter.   5 however, from the getgo, is action packed and horror lite. Crowds of enemies in broad daylight in the  African heat, followed by silly tentacle bosses like Excella or dragon sea monsters like Irving, huge minigun fights on a boat, plus other things. A co-op partner in the form of Sheva also helps eliminate any pure traces of survival horror.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like RE4 and RE5  a lot. Both of them are great games, I actually prefer 5 over 4, but you can‚Äôt deny.

It probably doesn't do much to assuage your worries about the way that you represent veganism (even though I don't think you need to worry about that), but if someone says something along those lines to you, you can just point out that veganism didn't give you an autoimmune disease. And by caring about your own health, about animals and about the environment, you *are* being a good example. You're doing what you can with what you have, which is all that can be asked of anyone.

Are you still married?  Are you still being abused?  Your post made it sound that way. &gt;Over the years, he's convinced them I'm the abuser and that an example of my abuse is calling the police  Abusers often accuse their victims of being abusive.  Your children are adults.  At this point in their lives, they should recognize his bullshit for what it is.  If they really think that you are the problem, then it sounds like they take after their father.  I'm sorry to say that. Is that the reason you don't want to go against him?  Because you're worried you'll alienate your children?

This was sparked out of conversation with a friend about the current mindset of the average American. The general distrust of our government, growing inequality(including the rise of AI and the inevitable massive loss of jobs), mass surveillance and consistent nuclear threat by delusional leaders being the main catalysts. And by media portrayal and tribe mentality among social media, these issues and the likelihood of revolution seem to be growing everyday.  It seems this form of corrupt government certainly has a limited life-span. It also seems relatively certain there lies a tipping point at which the majority of Americans will be so fed up with the failing system that unification to overthrow the gov is inevitable. Do you think it's likely, or even possible? Is it preventable or inevitable? What do you think this could look like? A lot of big, unanswerable questions here. Just curious what your thoughts are!

Ammonia is quite water soluble and the amounts we measure in aquariums are pretty small so you may actually be able to detect ammonia from the air in the water. Of course, it doesn't matter where it comes from as it has the same effect on fish. But if your tank is nowhere near your litter box or bird cage but you run the test near one, it could affect the results.

&gt;He said he supported the pair protesting, but wanted them to do it in other ways - kneeling after a touchdown in the end zone or writing and passing out a paper about the issues.  "I support a protest, but only when and how I say." Just sack up and say you don't support it--it's not support if you dictate how it's done.  I'd still think it's stupid, but could respect the honesty at least.  That said, there's really nothing anyone can do since it sounds like the program is private.  Such programs can set whatever standards they like as long as they don't discriminate against a protected class. A public school would be a different story I think.

Ms st course to ruining this for you. 
That's beautiful! I always loved the card, but the art never did a damn thing for me.
&gt; This makes no logical, rhetorical, or grammatical sense  Yes it does, because when you say the reasoning behind the action is fair but the action as taken is not you're defending the intent to take action, not the specific action itself. In this sense you defend an action taken in response to their thinking, just not the kind of action. The kind of thinking that leads to genocide is not rational, its not sensible, and its not fair. There is no just motive that makes people believe in mass rape. That is hate. Your entire premise is that there's a just way to think of another people in a way that can make you want to do this.  &gt;which is that you think I'm excusing rape  On some level you are to an extent. Its like if someone said "so and so got raped by her ex" and someone replied "well she did screw him over hard in the divorce". You know saying that is fucked up and you know the impulse to consider the action that way and then express it says something terrible about how the speaker is envisioning the dynamics of the relationship.  When people are tried for crimes the things you're saying are used as mitigation. The reasoning behind an act is used to lessen or strengthen the condemnation and ensuing punishment for the act. On any level where you look at how our value system manifests judgment for actions taken you are mitigating it.  &gt;The problem with your argument is that nowhere did I say I supported the how of the Burmese actions  I already acknowledged that. I said that doesn't matter and I have explained why. Your prejudice against Islam allows you to justify however thinking in these grotesque terms and think you're clean in doing so.

It depends on whether the toll collection authority has a reciprocal agreement with the state/province.  I have used British Columbia plates in Washington and California, and successfully evaded the tolls because while my license plate was scanned, no agreement was in place to actually track me down and bill me. Same for using California plates in Ontario, Canada.  Toll collection authorities will only track down out-of-state plates that they expect to show up frequently. For example, New York is often visited by drivers from Ontario and Massachusetts, so if you're from those places and try to use NY tolled roads without an EZPass you will get nailed. Likewise, Ontario will track drivers from Quebec, Michigan, and NY for sure. But if your car is registered in California, then it's highly unlikely that they'll bother to track you down. It costs them money to do so, and California-plated cars are a rare sight in that region.

As for the name? I doubt he was the first to pioneer it but I've always called them Wheeler handles or Wheeler knock off's because he does it correctly while the majority fall short.  I love the look of these handles in photo's but the pinky swell is almost always too wide/fat for my tastes. Not a fan of having my index grip tighter than my pinky's. I prefer an equal grip across the handle or slight tapering towards the rear.  I understand the idea behind the design but it is actually counter intuitive for such a small knife. The flair is better suited on a chopper above 10" in blade length. Think Kukri handles.  If my pinky doesn't touch or nearly touch the inside of my palm when I grip it, it's too fat and diminish the overall grip. I'm not a big guy but I have piano fingers and if the blade wont fit my hand it wont fit a 6' 5" mans hand correctly either with there extra body fat.  If you want a great example of these in slight variations look too Nick Wheeler. He does it right. You'll notice the pinky swell on most of his models are obviously smaller than the index grip unlike the one in the linked photo. And if they are not they are more dramatically shaped at the rear. Doesn't look as pretty but I feel it's more practical.  Here's a great [example](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXwy6dKFuew/?taken-by=nick_wheeler_knives_and_newfs). It may be hard to tell for some but that extra meat being removed will make a world of difference in the hand.  Quick test for people at home. Hold your hand up. Is your pinky as long as your index? If no then the swell should not be thicker than your index unless your intention is to make a chopper. Equal grip across the boards makes for a more versatile grip but the blades shape truly dictates the knifes usage so plan accordingly.

It's really hard to know why Roger has such poor conversion rate relative to what you'd expect given his normal performance. It's hard to say he's choking, because he's extremely good on tie breaks.   Perhaps he's overly conservative on breaks? I'm not sure, I feel like he's often too concerned with just landing the return in on breaking points and not risking it enough. Not always, of course, but often.

I'm not sure why, but it might have something to do with being a bit of a control freak.

The reasons for them not using it are vauge, we don't know exactly why, even in Gods of Mars they don't specify EXACTLY...since that's the freaking mantra of most black library books, they never want to be specific unless it leads to a plot which IS ambiguous.   but as for it being part of necrontyr tech.  &gt;Kotov sighed and nodded as if Roboute had passed some kind of test.‚ÄòVery well, Mister Surcouf, I believe you may be correct. Perhaps some aspect of necrontyr technology does lie at the heart of the Breath of the Gods, and if that is the case, then it is doubly imperative we prevent Telok from leaving this world.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhy?‚Äô said Anders, ‚ÄòI mean, besides the obvious?‚Äô ‚ÄòBecause if there is any truth to the old legends, then it is entirely possible that a vast shard of one of the ancient necrontyr gods lies entombed within the Noctis Labyrinthus.‚Äô And suddenly it all made a twisted kind of sense to Roboute. He turned to Bielanna, who appeared to be studiously ignoring their conversation. ‚ÄòYou knew, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äô he said. ‚ÄòYou said as much back in the cavern. What did you call it? ‚ÄúThe infernal engine of the Yngir?‚Äù I‚Äôm going to assume that‚Äôs your word for the necrontyr gods.‚Äô Bielanna nodded slowly. ‚ÄòNow you see why we fought so hard to stop you,‚Äô she said. ‚ÄòAnd why we now spill our blood to help you.‚Äô

Depending on the size of the lens you're using, you can sometimes get decent results by getting right up to a chain link fence and shooting "through" it.   As it stands, there's no real subject here. The viewers' eyes just aren't drawn to anything in particular. 
Wooooo
Come on Truex I want you to win really badly.
Will have to disagree considering they aint. LOL people thumb down like total bots.  Both are offensive abilities and one is Doomfist primary weapon and allows him to take range started attack. The other is a long range attack for a melee. They both offensive and kill people and do damage but Doomfist attack only hits one target with damage whilst Firestrike goes through all targets.
Sad but true
I love this. When my mother was in the hospital after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her (very healthy looking) doctor told her that she had beat the same cancer herself many years ago. It was an incredible ray of hope for my mom. No doubt the kids that this girl treats will feel as hopeful when they find out she beat cancer too.

&gt;does Blackbeard already found out about poneglyphs?  He better have. He's already been established as someone who does his research on things of interest and the pieces that fit into his plan of becoming Pirate King. Also, if he didn't know before, his status as a Yonko, acquisition of a large crew and islands should've provided the opportunity for him to have discovered that at some point.  &gt;and his whole crew gang up on her its likely he'll take her down  If Blackbeard still needs his entire crew to take down one weakened Yonko, he's weak, and I hope that isn't the case.

Yeah. In theory you could visit a half dozen countries scattered around the globe in a single day.  Wake up in New York, have breakfast in London, a business meeting in Japan, then lunch in San Francisco, then another meeting in Sydney, dinner in Shanghai and then go to bed in Rome.  I dunno why you'd fly to another country for meals before moving on to another for the next meeting, but you could do it.   I could see some rich guy trying to see just how many non-neighboring countries he could get through in the space of 24 hours, just for  fun.

Meh, Danteh is more mechanically skilled than Esca is, and it's not like his gamesense is lacking. Individually I don't think you can really say Esca is significantly better, but at the same time if you replaced Esca with Danteh LH may not do as well because I gather Esca is a very important personality to have on the team.   Hard to judge without POV, obviously, or at least good stats over reasonable sample sizes.

How? All I said was that what you're probably classifying as a skilled PK (someone who doesn't use lights and zone much,) is someone that's probably losing a lot, because zone and lights attack are the best and kinda only good parts of her kit.

&gt; If you're a sponsor, would you rather have 100k watch for 1h or 200k for 30 minutes? (Made up numbers). To me, the clear answer is 200k, and I'm pretty confident they agree.  That's a made up number and didn't really portray the changes though. You're making an assumption that the total unique viewers are double for half the time. While it's true that total unique viewers might increase, there is nothing to support the idea that it'd double. On the other hand, it is already proven that the total number games (time) will be less than half of the previous year.

&gt;Elaborate, please. Show me where I said abandon your mortgage, kids and wife.  You stated to leave the premises, by virtue of American law, having left the premises is considered abandonment of the home and the children in the home. This is well proven through the amazingly broken family court system.   If you leave the home, you can pretty much write off ever seeing your children again unless you are independently wealthy and the wife/girlfriend does not have access to the accounts.   &gt;I‚Äôve about had my fill of Internet warriors who put words in people‚Äôs mouths, instead of owning their assumptions and having an adult conversion.  I made no assumptions, you said to leave the premises, then you said you didn't mean it, that it was "figurative".   Say what you mean and you won't have all of these "internet warriors" putting words in your mouth. In fact, if it happens so often, perhaps you should stop bitching about it, and start asking why it is that your statements are so often incorrectly read differently than you meant them.   &gt;So, please, fucking show me how I minced words.  OK.  You said.   &gt;Woman hits you, you leave the premise one way or another.   Then you stated what that meant was:  &gt; I didn‚Äôt mean, ‚Äúleave right now and never look back‚Äù. More like, walk out of the room or building to let things simmer down a bit.   To which I reminded you that in the American legal system, doing so is seen as willful abandonment and will count against you in court the majority of the time.   So first you said leave the premises, then said you didn't mean to literally leave, just go to another room. Cause women can only hit you standing in one spot, they could never possibly follow you. It's their one weakness right.   As an aside, you have made the mistake numerous times now, it is "premises", not "premise". THE MORE YOU KNOW ÂΩ°‚òÜ

And then proceeds to tell the rest of us how we ought to walk (drunken meanderings being explicitly prohibited), saying God told him to do that, too. And we'll be punished if we don't listen.
To be blunt, it's *really* immature to just say "I'm going to act however I want or find most convenient and everyone else should just deal with it." The rest of the world doesn't revolve around you, and if you expect everyone else to change *for you* it's not going to happen. If you're acting clingy and insecure and that's turning people off, no one cares that you "can't control it."

I like to think of it like scotch on the rocks. At the beginning, at its freshest, the flavors are bold and really pop, things are exciting and a great opener for the adventure your about to experience. As you get farther along and things soften and mellow, you notice the softer notes as they are allowed to come to prominence. And at the very end you are gently let back down as you throw back that last little cusp of flavor and the experience fades. All great breakfast cereal, like scotch, is a journey.

I'm super picky about screens, and I don't think it really matters. There is an office supply store near me that still has 9.7 inch iPad Pros on display as well as the new iPad 2017, and I'm not kidding, I thought they mislabeled the demo units. I was so convinced they had swapped the labels on the demo units that I had to put the serial numbers in a search engine to verify that the iPad 2017 and the iPad Pro 9.7 were properly labeled.  If you know what to look for, it's more clear, but it is hard to tell the units apart if you're doing it for the first time.  Incidentally, the screen on the iPad 2017 is not "bad". In fact, if you Google the Notebookcheck measurements of the screen, it's actually quite accurate. (In terms of measured DeltaE within the sRGB gamut, both grey and color, it's actually better than the measurements Notebookcheck got for the 10.5 iPad Pro -- though individual numbers aren't everything and there will obviously be variation between panels.)  Two good things about the iPad 2017 that I've noticed:   * There is less color variation severely off-angle than both generations of the iPad Pros. I think this is due to the difference in coatings, or perhaps the presence of the sensing layer for the Apple Pencil.  * The anti-fingerprint oleophobic coating on the iPad 2017 is definitely more effective than on the Pros. I think they had to compromise there to support the Apple Pencil.  There is a little more brightness variation on the iPad 2017 in comparison to the Pros, and of course there is no support for an extended gamut or 120 Hz. But on the positive side, I find the iPad 2017 is easier to hold in the hand because of the bezel size and the slightly smaller screen is better for reading eBooks.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy the iPad 2017. I think it's one of the best deals Apple has ever offered.

What I'm thinking of is how natives and first nations in North America had lands and property taken by the government. As the government passed laws and executive actions to allow these seizures there is no 'legal' requirement for restitution, but there is obvious moral need to repay what was taken. Is there a name for such debts, where the debtor has escaped legal obligations, but there is a societal and moral expectation they repay the debt?

Yep, that's what I'd suggest too.  I run Death, Curses, Reaper on my Necro, but Blood is a solid alternate to Reaper if you don't have HoT.

I, too, was at Ribfest. A rib cooker singles out some young guy wearing a white "Where's the beef?" T-shirt, standing off to the side. He says "Hey buddy! That T-shirt ain't going to stay white for long" as he points to his immaculately clean white apron, confusing those watching the exchange. The young guy says "oh, I won't be *eating* any ribs", and honestly his emphasis of the word *eating* creeped me out a bit, but whatever. So the cook huddles with associates and seem to come to some type of agreement and calls back over to the young guy "Hey Buddy! Come here a minute!" So he walks over and the cook turns on a loud white noise machine and we can't hear what they're saying. After a lot of emphatic hand waving, head nodding &amp; shaking, and some frantic scribbling and erasing on a white board, the young man walks over to the rib line (which is pretty long at this point since no one's been serving ribs). Everyone in line does a triple-take as the man takes his place in line, and the whole line is now murmuring to each other trying to make sense of it all. Someone finally incredulously asks "What could the cook *possibly* have said to you to convince you to eat after you already declined one single time?!?" The man smiles and says "Well you see, I'm a VEGAN and can't eat meat, so the cook had offered to clean off the grill and make me some scrambled eggs instead." And one of the people in line says "I didn't know they had scrambled eggs! I want that". Others joined in "Me too!" "I'll pay double!" "Triple!" "Money is no object!" It was pandemonium. Another man stands in line with very puzzled look on his face. The line continues to swell as more people hear the rumor of scramble eggs and eventually all the Vegans at Ribfest make their way to the line. Finally, the puzzled man speaks up, "Excuse me, I know this is none of my business, but do you mean vegetarian?" The original white shirt guy gives his own puzzled look in return. So the puzzled man clarifies "Well it's just that you said you're a vegan but you're about to eat eggs, which are an animal product - plus I think there's probably milk in it too if they're doing it right" Someone else shouts "And vanilla extract!" And the puzzled guy says "Yeah, maybe. But that's not an animal product. Anyways, I think maybe you meant vegetarian rather than vegan, since it sounds like you don't eat meat rather than all animal products?" White shirt: "Vegan, vegetarian, what's the difference?" Puzzled guy: "Um, well, I *just* explained the difference. You know what? Never mind; it's none of my business anyway." Then someone pipes up "Won't the egg mixture just run through the grill?" "Maybe they have a skillet?" someone replied.   After all the eggs were handed out everyone held hands and ate their eggs (with their faces pressed into the paper plates since they didn't have their hands free). It was the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed; people of all genders coming together and eating scramble eggs with their faces. I shed a single tear and clapped, a slow non-sarcastic clap. My hands were free because I couldn't eat the eggs - I'm gluten intolerant. u/manic_eye

&gt;No, you're playing word games. Either enslavement is the price of being saved, or the act of saving and the act of exploiting are separate. You can't have it both ways.  That's not how you've described the situation. If they offered him safety in exchange for becoming a slave, while he was floating through space, that would be a different issue. This would be the one case where the act of enslaving actually improves the situation.  &gt;Here you are not comparing exploitation with slavery, you are comparing selling with slavery. Selling someone an apple is not exploitation.  OK: You are starving and I sell you an apple for 100 000$. - I still improve your situation.   &gt;Maintaining slavery requires constantly feeding, clothing and sheltering your slaves, so you are continuously improving their position. These acts are necessary to slavery, but slavery is not necessary to these acts.  Ah, but here's the rub! The only person who can judge the change in quality of the situation is the person themselves. If the upkeep produced an actual net improvement to the slave's situation, they would not need to be a slave - they would work voluntarily! The fact that a threat of violence is necessary to keep the slave working implies that maintaining slavery actually worsens their situation.  For slavery to be slavery (forced actions), a threat of force must be present. And this means that the slaver necessarily worsens the slave's situation to make them choose to work!
The Ello isn't going to blow your mind but it is one of the best included in a kit with very dependable coils. The only other kits that have a good tank are the Vaporesso mods as far as I know.  The Vtwo has a trash tank, kroma-a is meh, Kanger tanks are across the board bad, etc.  Edit: the Ello is probably disappointing because of how good the original Pico tank was. The Mello. That doesn't mean the Ello is bad.

I would say their denim is the best bet. I've bought several pairs from them and they have all turned out well.   The tees on the other hand are pretty inconsistent. I have some that fit perfectly and others that fit like crap. They also do not hold up too well over time. They tend to really lose their shape in the wash compared to my Reigning Champ and 3Sixteen shirts, but that's a bit of unfair comparison. 
Fake service dogs are a problem but it's usually obvious when it's not a service dog.

From what you've said, I don't understand why she thought your dog was a fraud.

Group size is small (3 teachers for a class of 6) and I love the her teachers. She's  helper at school but gets whiny if she's hungry and it's not snack time or lunch time yet.  So pretty reasonable! Everyone loves her.  Except for that one time that she covered herself in bird poop on the playground somehow.  I thought it was hilarious.  The worst part is having to pre-make food for her every single day.  Breakfast, AM Snack, Lunch, and PM Snack. So tiring! Luckily we're getting a routine down for that too.  Not School related- My husband bought me a piece of wood so that I can make a height ruler chart to have on the wall in our apartment.  I want to make it (as opposed to just using a door jamb) so that when we get a house of our own we can bring it with us!  I'm excited :)  TLDR: First month at school is great! Also, I'm excited to start a new project!

Thanks got a bit excited and posted this one slightly, (OK very too), early thus the mad rash of edits afterwards. I had the idea and just had to post lest it suffered becoming another project prevarication, got so much to do at the moment but so little wilpower to knuckle under.  EDIT Curses, one more edit before the sun sets or is it the night falls.

The organization themselves is filing the suit. From the article it seems the leader, who is a lawyer,  is a racist piece of shit. Filing potentially frivolous law suits sounds like something on the lesser end of the bad shit this guy does.   Here is an apt quote to showcase what type of man he is  &gt; [Kill every goddamn Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist supermarkets!](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/malik-zulu-shabazz)   That said, I have no idea if this lawsuit has merit or not since I'm not a lawyer but this guy being associated with it is horrible pr for trying to get people to support it. 
Rolling with Watson. Need a game before I trust Amari again and Crabtree is questionable. Too many question marks. Fairly confident in starting Carr ROS though.
&gt;That doesn't logic right. There may be 1000 types of Christianity but none of them are related to whether Christianity is "correct," again, whatever that means.   Sure it does. If we take that Christianity is the correct religion ( instead of atheism or *insert a list of all other deistic ideology here*) then any given Christian has a 1 in 1000 shot at interpreting the dogma in the correct way as to not be a blasphemous hell bound sinner.   &gt;What does it mean to be correct   In this case it means that of all available options, both past and present, you successfully chose the one that ends up being true.   &gt;and furthermore, what does a sect of Christianity not practicing Christianity correctly mean to whether Christianity is correct?   Nothing. That's why I said that if we accept the **premise** that Christianity is correct, it still only gives any single practioner a one in 1000 shot at being right. It does not bear on wether or not Christians are right, that number was too astronomical to calculate.

Yeah, this is why I'm not too upset about it, it's still a beta.

Maybe it has to do with the fact that being a reservist sucks shit these days.  I left a while ago, but comparing what we got to do, compared to what the militia got to do in the 1980's, it is why no wonder why no one wants to stay in anymore.  Guys I know that were in in the 80's talk about thousands of reservists being on exercises in the summer and thousands on exercise in the winter. M113s, Grizzly, Cougar and Husky armored vehicles, multiple artillery batteries, Air Force helicopters for infantry air assaults, air defense batteries, thousands of mortar rounds, the fucking FN, New MLVW's, Rambo tier amounts of M72's, parade squares that fit 1500 soldiers and full support battalions were normal things. Sometimes Reg force was fully/partially involved, sometimes they weren't.  Compared to now.  Maybe 300 or 400 reservists will go one exercise if the Land Force Area can afford it that year. No M113's, no LAV's, Shit ass LSVW/Milverado/G-Wagon/MLVW vehicles. No artillery except the 4 forty year old field guns that the artillery platoons have in the whole province. Maybe the Air Force will be able to afford to send out 1 or 2 unarmed helicopters for a day or two. Maybe the medics will set up a tent if they can get enough members to go on exercise. The food will come from the base kitchen or will be MRE's because the service battalions are incapable of getting enough people or equipment to provide those services. Any M72 training will be 35mm training insert on a reused tube. Your unit and the exerciser run out of training rounds so you literally say "Bang Bang" when "shooting". Soldiers get encouraged to stay home on range qualification days because their units can't afford to qualify everyone on even the C7 let alone the machine guns.  That same parade square has crumbled so much that it could only parade two under strength platoons. The military can't afford to fix it, and there is no point in fixing it really. The reserves totally depend on the Regular force as well.   That and the older aged higher ranking NCO's that are just riding it out to top up their pension.   Reservists are part time. If you are going to attract high quality and talented people to the reserves, it has to be fun. Why would anyone earn very little money one night a week and do basically nothing with not much opportunity stay? The $1.25 beers in the mess only make up for doing your 3rd BFT of the month for so long. 
People say this all the time, but one of my party plays with controller on PC, and I didn't know about it until he casually told me. We are both Gold III (*strange since we play together*), but I never felt he was carried, he's not the best nor the worst of the squad, he has a 1.2 K/D in Ranked which I'd say is good. Honestly I used to play on console, and I notice the increased accuracy of the mouse almost only on long range gunfights, which are quite rare in R6S
*Phallus hadriani*  *P. impudicus* and *P. hadriani* differ only in the color of the volva (white in the former, purplish in the latter).  
I love Gerolsteiner for the same reasons.  It is the strongest seltzer I've had.  And I used to drink for the same reasons, too.  I was never one to drown my sorrows.  But I couldn't stop a good feeling from taking the party way too far.  A good, hard-hitting seltzer really does the trick, though.

I seem to remember having Bitmoji before other people. Your report very well may have had an effect, that seems to be the biggest use of Beta. We're the only people who have direct access to the devs to tell them our problems and, if they're small enough, get them fixed fairly quickly. All I'm saying is, though, is that if you have a Beta feature, maybe include it in the Beta release? I mean, sure they tested the multiple videos thing but it's not like they're going to get bug reports on it for as long as it's disabled so how do they know if the edits they're making are working for the people that complained?
 You could just ask them out to a movie, restaurant, bar, or to do whatever else you like to do and let things happen more organically. 
Good.   Vote for them.   You obviously hate the Greens.  Vote for the Greens if you like.   Why don't you?
No, it's really not. Knowing your name does not mean you can be assessed for capacity. That patient is having a life-threatening respiratory decompensation and a psychiatrist is never going to tell you "don't intubate them until I get a chance to do my 30-minute competence assessment." That's why none of the physicians in this thread thought a psych assessment was a reasonable suggestion, and it's why you're getting downvoted. You need to just accept that you didn't understand this clinical scenario.
Terrible snap and hold. Not on the kicker.
To be honest, vanilla stalker is pretty shit compared to modded stalker, it's an inferior experience.

Many schools would only want SAT subject scores if you are sending the SAT, but in your case, your SAT scores are much better than your ACT scores so you should probably send those. As far as subject tests, that is a huge range of scores for the Math II you are getting. The Lit test is generally considered pretty hard, so even a 650 isn't that bad of a score. What books are you using for Math II? I could give you some tips on how I crammed the week before the test.

I go to the mosque where they beat their chest (I like to be in spots with a lot of people so I don't have to beat it hard and it looks like I just can't with the guy in front of me being &lt;a feet away. I have to do zinjeel where I hit my back with the chains (been doing since 5th grade). At the end my uncle came up to me and told me that I needed to hit my back harder, he showed me a video of my fatass where I looked like a suicidal kid. I've gotta admit the worst part is sitting on the ground during the lectures in Arabic which I don't understand yet I am supposed to attend earlier than regular.

Mazda already has a limited partnership with toyota. I wouldn't be surprised if they merged or cooperated much more closely.
Essentially what auto said. Everything is about the moment, there is nothing but the moment. Both past and future are concepts of mind. There is only change, every thing comes and goes. Now, what you do in the moment is what creates your life. What you set was an intention to do something, you knew what you had to do in the moment and you executed. What I'm saying is, there's no need to worry about something that hasn't come to pass, or get excited and create delusions of grandeur. Not necessarily that I say don't plan for the future or intend to direct your life a certain way.

Let me elaborate, this unofficial app, released 4 weeks after the launch of Destiny 2, hit the mark on how the vault should be presented. It went FURTHER by adding sub categories, which just makes it look even cleaner.   If I wanted to find a specific helmet I have in my vault, and it‚Äôs located right in the middle, I‚Äôd have to skim over weapons first, then narrow my search through all of my armour to find one piece. If they had tabs for armour and weapons, I‚Äôd go to the armour tab to look. If they went further and added subcategories, I‚Äôd just have to look through that.
Well said! :D

LIS had me enjoying Chloe as a character but irritated in some respects. BTS has made her my favourite character and justified plenty for why she is the way she is in LIS. I'm looking forward and not looking forward to finding out how Rachel ends up with Frank. Chloe considers her a close connection and inevitably at some point, a lover, otherwise she wouldn't have flipped out when you find out the relationship of Rachel and Frank. Rachel's someone I think who enjoys playing with people to a degree and is almost certainly a liar, yet is the thing with Frank because of something that happens, or are the feelings genuine, and what possesses her to betray Chloe? Or was it all misinterpreted by Frank or mis-sold as something more serious than it really was. Hard to say.  So many questions. Team Chloe all the way though. Hella looking forward to the next episode. #hashtagNotmyDavid

Just be honest with them. Expect their reactions to be negative. You said you met him a year ago - any grown man who pursues a minor is going to get a healthy amount of criticism for doing so.
lets see how deep this rabbit hole goes...
AP and Reuters twitter are both bare bones, but will give accurate, factually correct information.   The BBC radio service, NPR, Al Jazeera, &amp; PBS Frontline will give more in-depth reporting with context, but be aware that each of them will frame certain stories in ways that correspond with their political supporters (I.E. BBC may give biased Brexit coverage, NPR is very pro-establishment for the major 2 parties in the states, Al Jazeera on Israel/Palestine). But generally anything they cover in world news will be pretty in-depth and well covered, especially if you cross reference with other news agencies to get various viewpoints. 
It's cool I was just trolling.

If it says that, it's outdated. Contact the mods and they can cross it out. Or if it's not outdated, then they'll let you know, but as far as I know, Memu is dead and Remix OS still works (and can be installed even if it's not still updated). As for Win 10, can't comment on that, though it's hard to believe it Remix OS doesn't dual boot on Win 10.

&gt;there is no universal "motherhood" that spans across species  Uhh...what? Animals have mothers and animals are mothers to their babies. Cows being mothers isn't something hippies made up to try to anthropomorphise them... that's the term everyone uses for a female that bears young. I get that you're saying human motherhood is especially cool and important because we're smart and all that. Fair enough. But motherhood *literally, factually* spans across species, and dairy absolutely is related to motherhood. The industry wouldn't exist without it.

I was skeptical about them but then a bunch of cucks got all huffy over the merger and left the Conservative parties and that made it all a lot more appealing in my eyes.

What will grow well depends in part on where you live - short season or long, coolish summers or blistering heat, etc. Probably want to factor that in.  Late afternoon sun tends to be strong so shade lovers like ferns might not be the best bet. The upside of afternoon sun is that it will support a wide variety of colorful plants: annuals like fancy trailing geraniums and sun resistant coleus (Trailing Plum is pretty and dependable http://davesgarden.com/guides/pf/go/57816/) in hanging baskets. In pots, you could grow dwarf zinnias, dwarf to mid-height snapdragons, petunias in a zillion colors and patterns, and sun resistant impatience like SunPatiens (http://www.costafarms.com/plants/impatiens-sunpatiens) for color.  Something I tried for the first time this year that was super cute and unusual was dwarf eucomis or pineapple lilies. They grow from spring-planted bulbs in half day sub and look great from June into fall. Very unusual and whimsical. I grew this variety and will again:  http://www.leafari.com/eucomis-aloha-nani-hybrid.html  You have lots of options. Have fun!

I *rate* everything, but I've never rated a proper series less than a 5 since I don't seek out shows that I think I'll find shit (Except for Shitcom, but that was a 1 minute thing for the joke).  My score deviation is actually -.5, so apparently I'm a slightly harsh rater compared to average. For currently watching it's -1 because I've only rated Fate Apocrypha and NGNL, and I don't like the sound of tactical nukes every time something falls down.

I‚Äôm not very familiar with Audition, but you should have no trouble recording at -12dB without any effects in Audition.  Are you hearing clipping with the recorded signal?  It sounds like something is wrong with Audition if normalizing to -3 isn‚Äôt actually bringing the peak level to -3. Like the meters are maybe calibrated to a different scale than DBFS. Again, I‚Äôm not familiar, but I can‚Äôt imagine what scale it would be calibrated to in this case.

80%? Where are you *getting* this from? It reduces your *two thousand* dodge bonus by four hundred at level 10. 1600 is still formidable.  EDIT: Or, in terms of the percent formula I just saw in the FAQ out there, it reduces your +200% dodge bonus by 50%, and +150% is still incredible.

Ya imo my friends either loved or had no interest in monogatari. If you didn't like the shaft aesthetics, long narration, and general stye of the show, you'll prob not care for it ever.   Only thing I could suggest is give the kizumonogatari movies a try. You're usually suppose to watch it after bakemonogatari but it's better than not watching at all. Kizu is more "newcomer" friendly than the rest of the series due to less narration and more action then usual.  I've gotten a lot of people hooked to the show,who dropped bake at first, with the movies.

Other than using pipes for fuel and waste I've only ever used the flux points, so I'm not sure if you can use cables. That being said, with the flux points you have to have a redstone flux access point (I believe is what it's called) as one of the blocks, with the flux plug attached to it. Might need a similar one for cables. Assuming you've built the reactor correctly, and have fuel and turned it on...as I may or may not have done once...

Prior to IP there were trade secrets that protected innovators from competition. Heck, many candy companies still have trade secrets today rather than patents. The idea isn't that IP protects competition, as competition would be fine without it. The issue is that IP provides other benefits besides rent seeking to innovators, advantages that aren't talked about.  Imagine modern medicine with trade secrets. There's no way for it to work. How would you provide studies if the methodology and composition couldn't be known by third parties? NDAs are a modest solution but everyone has a price. Patents means the mode of action of a medicine is out in the open so it can *immediately* begin benefiting future science.  Trade secrets are also, well, secrets. It incentivizes industrial espionage which is usually damaging and illegal and harmful.  However IP as it currently exists has flaws. Right now the incentive is not to get a patent and get back to inventing because it is more profitable to get a patent and use it as a bludgeon to sue for damages and prevent others from innovating. Inventing and progress must wait on the patent to expire which does more harm to innovation than the patent protects.

I'm not sure if comparing Battlefield and Call of Duty is a proper thing. Battlefield is not like Call of Duty at all. They might both be FPS, but that's like trying to compare DOOM to Fallout. They're 2 completely different games.  This whole "Is one better than the other?" doesn't make sense to me, one is massive battles with vehicles, classes, realistic sounds, teamwork, massive maps, and objectives. The other is tiny maps, fast gameplay, no recoil, and few players.  These 2 games are nothing alike.

My last LTR was with an intelligent woman who is a prosecutor, so I can attest that everything you have written here is spot on- both her behaviour and mine. I found TRP after the relationship failed in this manner.   Following that, doesn't that mean that some of the womens' quotes from the original article are actually fair? A miniscule sliver of men have red pill traits (learned or inherent). So when these women self identify as intelligent any man who can't stand up to their shit is going to be perceived as intellectually weaker, whether they are an astrophysicist or not.   This is just another shit test, and nothing a quick evisceration on a chess board wouldn't solve to quiet their lamentations.

Neither. Fine as-is. Fort eats enough rounds to be worth the increase, but it isn't made to make you immortal. The 7.62x25mm would probably be able to knock through the slightly-less-than IIIa protection that fort provides, with a few rounds driven into a tight grouping IRL.

I think a lot of people don't realize this about indigenous folks is that a lot of the councils are insanely corrupt.  Generally any money made on reserve usually stays among the council and their families.  I feel sorry for those people.  I used to live in North Western Ontario and man they got the short end of the stick from both the government and their own people who were supposed to be their "leaders".  Many weren't allowed to drink on the res so usually once a month when the cheques came in they'd drive to the nearest town that had an LCBO, Beer Store, and Walmart/major grocery store and just clear the places out.  Two things wouldn't be uncommon to see at the local hotels/motels in town at the end of the month A. Pick up trucks full of food/supplies/etc and drunk/passed out natives everywhere. Naturally they couldn't get TOO drunk (many of the young ones would) otherwise they ran the risk of someone nosey person who lived in town (in small towns everyone knew everyone even if they lived on the res) to call the council leaders and rat on some poor drunk native kid. Add to the fact that they would jack up the prices on all the food/supplies on the res because a lot of times the council leaders were in league with either the airline that would fly the stuff in or the companies that would truck the stuff in and get a cut of the profit from that. Overall they were just insanely corrupt and treated their own people like shit and then just told them it was the white man.
Greed mode was already possible, Greedier is what was unbalanced. The movement was fine too imo, I got used to it after a few runs.  The bug fixes that made the game litterally unbeatable are what are really big here.
This is literally how he campaigned. What is wrong with you?
Ooh that's nice :) thank you

When someone asks for help they probably already tried it by themselves. No need to go elitist even as a joke.
DAE think we should just brand users of subs we don't like with a universal flair so we know their subjective opinions are wrong by default? üòÇ

Any two episodes. Each episode has its own 'score'. I think the term is 'music bed', which is different from 'cue', but I may be wrong on the terms.

I have a very strong feeling against fusing limited units ever.
In that case make sure you haven't just popped a hemorrhoid. 
Definitely not mono-fire. It's just weaker and you get a lot of mileage from a second faction (either shadow or justice).
When virtue signaling and dating cross streams.
Hope someone figures out which Democrats have ties with this union leader! This sounds like a setup to make President Trump look bad. They couldn't find much to criticize him for with the other hurricanes, the Russia narrative is falling apart, etc and they needed something to trash him for that people would care about (obviously nobody gives a shit about the NFL).
The environmental cost of earplugs adds up over time, both in terms of the actual item and the packaging.
Oakland Raiders fans love to watch their team lose games. They're Oakland Raiders fans, after all.

Love the podcast
He just abuses tackles with power and then when they start bracing themselves for it he flies around them with speed and bend.
Goku was way beyond Frieza.  Goku held back because he wanted a good fight.  Frieza was at 120 million and Goku was at 150 million.  Goku since then got stronger so it makes sense he'd be above Cooler.  Although I would have liked a better fight too.

Consider the situation President Clinton inherited.  America at peace, prosperous, and an unchallenged colossus on the world stage.  What happened?  These three guys.
You do have a point, he is a "public" person and in his position/experience, probably he is used to all the flame/hate and controls himself in front of the camera. Maybe he curse us on his way home.  But do we need this? Should we keep doing "our part" and flame him, so he does his part and keep this mind game going? What I need to understand is what benefits we get from this.

The full quote just confused me even more. That did nothing to clear up what he meant. It looks like several half thoughts thrown together.

I'm so sorry for your loss, it's always hard :(
Wait ? The government does not need 50% of the seats in Parliament ? Are you sure ? We can have that over here in Germany, but that's a big exception to happen and you need 50% to pass any simple laws.  Also, thanks for answering.
It‚Äôs good to do both, I really like writing away from picture, especially at the beginning. But I still feel like you‚Äôll learn more as a composer by trying to write through a scene than if you wrote the music first and tried to find a home for it.   Edit: autocorrect!
Brilliant rebuttal.
Supporting Real Madrid has that depressing effect on people.
Farsi means persian. Just like Persian can refer to the language and the people, Farsi is the same way
If you're be the one to do this, at least have something to say about the shot 
refund me for all the garbage DLC content i bought at full price. 
Colo kanjuro can do it for free spirit and striker teams. RR Fukuro can be used convert qck orbs on fighter teams (works well with gear 4). Haloween Cora can convert qck into matching for free spirit and cerebral. Also the new RR Heracles can convert right column type slots into matching for shooters and striker.  Edit: I forgot about the best one for slashers, RR Onigumo. Makes STR/DEX/QCK count as matching for driven and slashers, easy to socket and relatively low base CD.
Updoot for Callahan.
I spent every other day in a guitar store "just looking" last year and eventually walked out with my dream guitar and my #1, a Fender Jaguar. It's everything I've ever wanted in a guitar and more.   But now that you mention it I *could* use a new Humbucker guitar...
That's a perfectly logical strategy to get the most game for your buck but lowering their day1 price so that you buy the game earlier isn't doing the studio any favors.  They're better off selling at full price initially and slowly working their way down to your pricepoint.
I'm a simple man, I see Mississippi State, I root for them
FWIW You're actually what's known as a "reverse splitter," not a "splitter" because you have a high GPA/low LSAT. Cycles are hard to predict for splitters, potentially even more so for reverse splitters. 
It's a couple of different things:  I could be mistaken here, but in the traditional fighting game sense:  1. Tech = "Throw Tech'ing" or breaking and/or escaping a throw.  You'll usually hear the word "throw" closely associated with the word tech to seperate it from the second definition:  2. Tech = short for "Technology" or a method, strategy, or technique for dealing with a particular situation.  It's slang and doesn't really mean anything specifically but you'll hear it used in a phrase such as:  "Did you see that new reality stone-Spiderman tech?!  You know, the 'tech' where he can keep looping the freeze into web ball over and over again into massive combo damage."  Finally, I'm not a Smash/Melee player but I think "tech" means something slightly different there where it has more to do with ones ability to do certain (difficult) techniques on the pad.  Usually it follows closely with the second definition above, and contextually it usually make sense, but at times it could mean something slightly different.  Tl;dr -- it's generally the second definition unless the word "throw" is used closely to the word "Tech"
Obama was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Prisoners were there no clue if Iran would have even considered something else, and there's no clue if Iran actually helped profit the terrorist with money, plus that dug us in more debt

She was used to get a horrible, unfounded, pizzagate related shitpost to the front page (with all the shills that come with it,) to discredit the theory.   It was staged by the anti's.   Edit: TMoR alert. Fuck off TMoR.

Can anyone recommend suitable alternatives to Google (Gmail, Google search engine, Chrome), Microsoft, Apple etc for someone that isn't a computer whiz?   I've used Ubuntu in the past and I'm considering going back to that. One problem I had with it was sometimes not being able to get some programs to run on it. 
Plus, Chancellor of the free world sounds better anyway.

Anyone remember the game with LSU and Oregon State in the rain in 2004? Where Oregon State missed 3 extra points that day and ended up losing by one in OT?   Makes me LOL.
And what if you just summon the NPC?  I beat them solo my first playthrough, but on all subsequent playthroughs I summon Gael because I'm lazy and it makes the boss 10x easier.
There's other ways of dealing with the pain.  The surgeries and the medications opiate based that follow will put you in serious risk of restarting the cycle again.  This is what happened to me after years clean so be careful.

You did say end-game. Old man can't read.  Right. So. Bad mage with subjugated mages. He's gotta have some control over them beyond his threats, yes?
New York is brought up because it is the densest city in North America, and as an example that people are not ‚Äúgiving up privacy‚Äù for density. Reread the whole comment thread.
You are absolutely right as at least where I live, etizolam is not a controlled substance and is not tested for. So they would not have a etizolam solution to run through the gc ms for reference versus another sample

Nova launcher has so many gestures. It's so good.
I detect sarcasm.
Thank you . Idk why more people don't know this.
I would have figured that since it's a govt office they wouldn't care whether anyone showed up or not... In fact I would have expected them to be happy nobody was there.
That's fucking ridiculous.  Someone said something like that during the Sens-Rags series and I couldn't stop laughing.
You just wait. Whether she is or is not pregnant will reveal itself with time. Your friends are right, it's incredibly likely she's not pregnant, so try not to sweat it. It's not a bell you can unring anyway so no use freaking out over it. What's done is done.  If in 8 months or so she has a kid, you get a paternity test and go from there. Obviously if it's your kid you won't have a choice but to pay child support, etc.   I recommend you go no contact until then.

I didn't say he had the keys to all information, though I do think the Russians are feeding Wikileaks a good bit, but I do love the mechanical way he goes through people in a debate, the guy's a machine.
No very different than the ceramic donuts that yocan makes. This is not a donut and somewhat raised , I have not used it yet , I been using the dual Quartz so far but I'll try it and write back . 
I've had nothing but problems with UCCI since the switch. They canceled my policy for nonpayment a week after cashing the premium check that we sent them.   They keep mailing me "past due" bills even though I have electronic payments set up and they're being paid. But, the worst is that every time I call them their customer service reps are clueless. They take days to respond to anything that can't be immediately solved over the phone. Same thing if you ask for a supervisor - 24-48 hour call back.   I'm ready to give up and pay for private dental. 
OK. this proves it whoever did this is a moron and can't read intel sites showing the real relations between these entities. Nice propaganda tho. Keep trying while going down
Those are pretty good. I like his style.
From Portland timberline and skibowl are the closest with meadows being the furthest, but not by too much i feel.   As for traffic, I usually go up on the weekends, because of my schedule, but theres not a lot of traffic when they're opening(except for some holidays) but leaving is always the worst. Mostly because of the traffic converging from both timberline and skibowl, all trying to get back to Portland. Some days can be a breeze and others horrendous but with government camp being decently close stopping for a quick bite to let some time pass is always a solid choice. 
Like the rangers game, this game was a little heated too. Bats also fucked up and admitted to it.
Oh wow, didn't know. Uninstalling, its a shame though, its pretty cool :/
Me and my buds were cracking up for a whole match of Cod BO2 when we were getting destroyed by a guy named 'Tactical Grandpa'. I'll never forget the name.

I mean Shangela's original elimination was distinctly racist, and separate from the ground with her whole power lesbian aesthetic.

Now you're asking the right questions. I dunno I reckon something like disaffection, alienation, neglect and multitude of other factors. What do you reckon?
How exactly are these CL scams supposed to work where someone is selling a car that doesn't exist?  Are they thinking that an unsuspecting buyer is going to send them money before actually seeing the car/having the title in hand?  Who the hell would pay for a used Accord without going to look at at first?
wew.
He's just awful.
how did you take such gorgeous photo with the kit lens? all i get when using the kit lens is wash out and non sharp images. please teach me master 
Nooooooo
This sounds really cool! Hopefully this idea can be used at some point.
one would assume they would conduct an investigation to determine if criminal activity occurred.  Were they to determine it had, a criminal case might ensue (the process would involve handing it over to the prosecutors office to make a determination).  If they determined it was civil, that would be the end of it.  Law enforcement doesn't pursue civil matters (outside of some minor exceptions like contempt or certain child support issues.
Yeah, another post or two and you'll be challenging me to meet you behind the monkey bars 
I unfortunately agree
Breanne at Stone Salon in Hoover is awesome! She's great at being chatty if you want, or cutting in silence if you'd rather not talk.   Edited to add: she has a Facebook page if you wanna check out her work!

Basically most RHONJ need to step up their tag line games.  I do like Teresa's this up coming season, but only because it's a little more creative/ different compared to the others.  "The only life I envy is my own" ... I'm sorry idk how to fix it...

Lets say all these are like $200 a month I think.
A quick look at their career stats will show that Brees is better in almost every category, by alot. idk where you got that they were similar.  I'm not downvoting you btw.
Basically, if you have an expression pedal and a pitchfork, you can create this cool detuned chorus sound by tapping the expression pedal verrrrrry slightly from when it's at dry signal - pretty neat when you don't have a chorus, even if it is a bit fiddly! Now, two apologies: sorry the footage angles toward the pitchfork rather than the expression pedal when I'm tapping it, my brother is a goobus, and also, apologies for the bad guitar playing, its my brothers guitar and I'm normally a keys guy lol

Nah, you're cool man. Play what works :) it's not been too oppressive since the nerfs anyway.  Do you play any other games?
THIS IS SO WORTH IT. I felt really guilty hiring someone to clean my house like what, I'm too lazy to do it myself? WELL I AM. It is always the last thing on the list meaning it never gets done. For both of us! Would I rather we spent one of our precious days off together cleaning? Or banging? The woman and associates who clean my place make it look so good, that when they finished the first time I cried. Not a full on weep but it was so simple to pay a professional to do something I just hate. This is not worth the heartache to me. Dear OP, consider it.
