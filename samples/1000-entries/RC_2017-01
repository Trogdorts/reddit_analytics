Do you buy the minis yourself and include that in your fee or do you get shipped the mini from the client, if so assembled or not?

My cynical view on this is that it will never be free to the public.   Reason: what would be the draw of joining the military? Right now their selling point is free Healthcare and Education.   Ironically both are run horribly and most, that I've talked to, come out wishing they never went in.  
but gucci does this and no one says a word?

&gt;  almost valueless in modern (read that as bullshit grunt work) warfare.  To be fair, in some ways that's due to equal parts technological superiority and limited rules of engagement. We thankfully haven't been involved in any significant conflicts with peer or neer-peer countries recently, and everyone else knows it's pretty pointless to fight us in the air because it'll be a complete turkey shoot (ground to air is a bit different). On the other hand, conflicts like Syria show exactly what can happen when you don't have control of the air, even when the opponent has a relatively rudimentary air capability. Fast movers would be very useful in preventing people from getting barrel bombed, but that's a decision that is made way above the tactical level. 
The only terms I couldn't figure out were "parcels" and "student accommodations."  Nifty!

My family owns a restaurant. These people are insane and probably don't understand to look for the best priced ingredients from different distributors. I think 2500 straws is about $12 at smart and final. 
I can't find any documentation for that. Also, even if it exists, having it be its own thing, completely separate from all other things, proves my bigger point, since you have to think hard if you wish to combine it with any other python OO helper lib.  It's a big mess of things with no assured mutual compatibility.  Perl6 oo is almost the same thing as any Moose-like, as Moose was inspired by it.
NY summon is the best since I got Leon and two bonus UA Yuri in just 150 stones. Also I did only one costume roll, so I was also taking a risky decision using them for NY instead.  I did Anni with 400 with nothing to show. And Christmas with 400 with only Christmas Rose. So this has somehow become the most banner units I've gotten so far.  
That's amazing. I admit, Gal Glam is one of those bloggers where I really do not get the hate, the hair-rage and the fatshaming. Every single post in her thread makes GOMI look like the last resort of crazies.

I hope people realize just how many people did not want Hillary.  Those who thought Trump was a good idea will regret it but it won't change the fact they really did not want Hillary either.  What your country needs to learn from Trump and Bernie and Ron Paul is that ANYONE who is not a **traditional** politician has a much better shot at politics than they thought.   You don't need ***A*** Bernie Sanders. You need 200.  You don't need ***A*** Ron Paul. You need 300.  You don't need ***A*** Donald Trump. You need 400.  You don't need ***A*** Elizabeth Warren. You need 800.

I'd hope so.  The thing is, although she's accusing me of never spending time around our daughter it's just not true.  We both took her to the zoo, the kid's museum, the pool, etc.  I didn't go on the daily walks because I was busy or in class, I've tried to get us to push potty training before she left etc.  I'm just more aggressively stepping up because I've got to do it all myself now. -_-

What I found kinda crazy is how a lot of lp's I saw actually let Chloe get slapped. Even if they were really shocked by what happened. Though, some of them obviously were use to more of a Telltale style and pretty much didn't realize they could change that choice.  Also, Lisa deserves better.

It sounds quite a lot like a stationary bowler that does less damage and can't counterattack. I like where your head is at, but I can't see why someone would run this when the bowler is only one elixir more. 
I just moved from GI to forged cavity-backs and love the feel &amp; weight of them. Now iron striking has been a stronger for me since I started. The two problems my GI (Rocketballz) gave me were too lite &amp; by being so big I felt like I had more room to mishit it. But the smaller face has me actually more focused &amp; I'm purring or closer to purring it more often.
No, in this case, they mean that you're a clown and you opinions mean less than nothing. You should reevaluate your outlook on life if a basketball organization farmers this much malice from you. 
Pep hasn't brought better tactics to city imo, I don't know if I respect pep for how he sets up his teams or find him foolish. The guy seems to look at the prem as if he can just go into any match and dominate it the way he did other leagues.   He definitely didn't respect Leicester every team in the league knows what they can do on the counter, and changed how they play against them City didn't even think about changing and was completely dominated. Again I don't know if I respect that or find him foolish.

&gt; mouses  mice.  The marketing campaign actually isn't shady, because it's not actually false advertising whatsoever. It just is irrelevant advertising. It would be false advertising if they phrased it as "other monitors are _not_ vista compatible".  Also, it's not that people are children, it's more complicated than that. For example, a lot of people are just exhausted by other things in their life, and they don't have the energy to learn certain things, so they fall back to trust behaviour. They trust that what is advertised is in their best interest. This exhaustion could come from any number of things, such as having 2 jobs, having lots of kids, and all sorts of other things. I myself know my energy is not limitless, and at times I need to just not put the effort into learning something, even though I learn a LOT all the time.  Another thing to consider is that a lot of people are programmed to think they're stupid, so they revert to the mentality that they can't learn computers, or other "complex" concepts. I'm not even talking about learning things like programming, I'm talking about say, learning a new OS. It's mostly interacting with menus, things that actually take very little work to learn. But plenty of people are programmed by advertising, their family and other sources to think they're incapable of learning things or are stupid. This also comes from how people in IT treat others. Are they actually stupid? Well, if they're a very good accountant for example, but have more to learn with computers, I would argue they are probably not stupid, just maybe have some barriers to overcome.  People are more responsive to things when you put more effort into how you approach them. Trust me, I'm an Elder of the Internet ;)

&gt; Greg's a great character. He could suffer of the Griffin-Simpson syndrome (don't get me wrong, i love those characters, but they're kinda 2D at some point), but this show has awesome scripters luckily.  Yeah, I could definitely see how he could end up becoming very two-dimensional. He seems fairly well-rounded so far, though - hopefully he stays that way!  &gt; I can relate to this. It's summer on Buenos Aires right now. It makes you hate life. It makes you hate the planet.  Oh that sounds awful. I love to complain about our humidity here; I'm sure it's a hundred times worse there. If it's any consolation, the weather here can't make up its mind - it's 80/90 degrees one day, in the 30's the next.   &gt; Please tell me we're going to The Winchester.  Gonna grab a pint and wait for all of this to blow over.  &gt; I still have nightmares of the time /r/stevenuniverse was turned into flavortown.  Is this a real thing that happened?

Its kind of what people get off on. They are too much of pussies once they get gear to go outside of their base, and when they do its just to raid shit shacks or go to the beach and kill nakeds.

The difference is that Go strings are arbitrary bytes but contain helper functions which assume utf8 encoded data. In Rust, there are seperate types for utf8 data and arbitrary bytes, and many methods are only implemented on the former.  Still, you can directly index bytes in Rust strings, it's just that mutating them is `unsafe` because you can break the utf8 invariant that way.

Wow! Things really, really clicked for you in April. What do you attribute that to? Did it click out of nowhere?
This year? Yes.  **Top 3 DBPM:**  Draymond Green: 4.9  Rudy Gobert: 4.6  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 4.3  **Top 4 DRPM:**  Rudy Gobert: 4.79  Draymond Green: 4.16  Andre Bogut: 4.03 (only plays 24 mpg though)  Giannis Antetokounmpo: 3.87  When Giannis is on the court the Bucks have a DRTG of 102.2, which would be 5th best in the league.  When Giannis is off the court the Bucks have a DRTG of 108.2 which is equivalent of 5th worst in the league. (Last time I checked I believe this was the greatest gap in on/off defensively for a starter)  And then he's also averaging 2 steals (T- 5th in league) and 1.8 blocks (8th in league).  He's been the 3rd best defender in the league overall this year objectively.  All of his DFG% metrics are among the best in the league as well. He's 3rd in Isolation defense, as well as you can see a great rim protector from this graph as well. He does it all now, basically just like a little worse  draymond now in terms of being able to guard every position effectively, guard the perimeter, guard Bigs, as well as rim protect.  Our team is an absolute horror show with him off the court. 
The problem is the distribution rights to IV are currently owned by 20th Century Fox and will presumably be forever unless something changes (such as Disney showing up with a briefcase full of money). Disney will get the distribution rights to the other five Lucas Star Wars movies automatically in May 2020.  Presumably Disney will cut some kind of deal with them around the release of IX and we'll see a 4K nine (eleven?) movie box set soon after.  On the technical front, [estimates say](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/could-disney-finally-give-us-the-remastered-unedited-star-wars-we-want/) that it would cost Disney less than a million dollars to fully remaster the theatrical version of the OT. It should be a pretty straightforward project, even if Lucas did indeed destroy the unused parts of the O-neg like he claims.  In any event, I've heard rumors that Disney really likes collecting money, and this seems like a pretty easy way to get a lot of it really quickly.

I know exactly how this feels, so you put it off if you can help it. If you can avoid being around other people, sometimes for a week or more. But you just slip further and further into a feeling of self-loathing and listlessness because of it. You know cleaning yourself up would make you feel better,but you don't care, just like exercising or tidying up. Sometimes it gets hard to get out of the chair.

It seems that you did the right steps to build the body.  Two things. Since you are building a single outfit, you can just click 'Build' instead of 'Batch Build'. By doing that Bodyslide shows the name of the file that was replaced. So, if you click 'Build', what message does Bodyslide give you?  Second, are you sure that you enabled mods in Fallout?

**Happy New Year!**  **Didn't finish before having to pick up wife:**   1989  **Played solo (as none of them contain mages or mythical beasts):**   Labyrinth WOT, Pax Pamir, Pax Porfiriana, Pax Renaissance, Bios Genesis **At least the rule book has been read:**   Manoeuvre, Hammer of the Scots, Hannibal Rome vs Carthage, Polis, Fields of Glory, Tash Kalar, Impulse, Imperial, Baltimore &amp; Ohio, Kemet, Tigris &amp; Euphrates, The King is Dead **At least they are punched and bagged:**   C&amp;C Ancients, Paths of Glory, Wilderness War, The US Civil War, For the People, Battlestar Galactica, Virgin Queen, Fury of Dracula **Played through the tutorial solo whilst cursing work and life commitments in general:**   Cuba Libre, Falling Sky **New Arrivals - at least the shrink is off:**   1846, No Retreat Russian Front, Comancheria My mate whom I normally play most of my 2P stuff with has been busy with house reno - so lots to catch up with there. Not much on the list that will see any action at our group's monthly game night. So games will have to wait till I can get our ad-hoc day sessions organised. We have been playing 1830 lately and will probably get a game of Imperial arranged next.

The claim in [your cited source](https://np.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/5lbyw5/in_regards_to_people_who_use_the_focus_on_the/dbulfzx/) is attributed to Steve Baldwin, the Executive Director of the Council for National Policy, [a conservative activist group in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_for_National_Policy) with [a very strong anti-LGBT focus](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/05/17/council-national-policy-behind-curtain). Baldwin has also claimed that [homosexuality is "deviant sexual behaviour"](http://www.westernjournalism.com/how-republicans-lost-the-same-sex-marriage-case/) and that ["mainstream homosexual culture commonly promotes sex with children"](http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/magazines/2003/march-april/from-closet-to-mainstream-the-homosexual-agenda).  Your cited source was published 14 years ago on WNP, [the self-professed "largest Christian website in the world"](http://go.wnd.com/aboutwnd/), which has also run pieces arguing that [homosexuality is a disability](http://www.wnd.com/2016/06/can-we-consider-homosexuality-a-disability/), that [homosexuality is a choice](http://www.wnd.com/2015/04/how-to-answer-is-homosexuality-a-choice/), that [homosexuality is not natural](http://www.wnd.com/2015/07/claim-homosexuality-exists-in-nature/), that [same-sex marriage will destroy the planet](http://www.wnd.com/2008/05/64769/), and that [soy products are making kids gay](http://www.wnd.com/2006/12/39253/).

I would agree with this, but of course its important to hubby that they use *his* sperm... So he understands the importance of being/feeling genetically related to your child. It's really asking for the moon and stars that he understand the same issue being important to OP?  If he can't bring himself to empathize, maybe OP can suggest they should look into adoption.

No, no, you got it all wrong! The only role I can play is jungler. When I'm doing another role, I usually have no clue of what to do. If you could help me... It doesn't even need to be a full guide to all roles, just one would be fine :3

Ringfinger. A friend played it for me and it stuck in my head for several days. I saved up my allowance and went to my local CD store.   I ended up buying the wrong album (broken), but that's okay because broken is fucking great too. I wish I had the copy that came with the little 3" CD of Physical and Suck.

I'm not suggesting he *should* be fired. A private company can decide what sort of public image it wants to have, can't they?  If he had a government job that would be a different thing.  And again, funding efforts to deny that right to the gay community is not the same thing as merely having an opinion. 
Not liking an acknowledged(from Toriyama himself)part of the canon is understandable but refusing to admit its canonicity(if that's even a word)is down right ridiculous.We have to draw a straight line between preferences and facts.

You're exactly right. This is not something deterministic - we only get a probability, and sometimes this probability is statistically significant and thus, may be useful in actual games.

OK, taking this 100% seriously: it's harmless.  Everyone eats their own nasal mucus by the pint every day.  It flows down the throat and into the esophagus by design -- this is part of your immune system, to move foreign particles captured in the mucus during breathing into your stomach (where foreign stuff goes to be broken down) and not your lungs (where it would enter the bloodstream).  Obviously it bothers you for social reasons, as it does for most of us.  So:  1. Stop making such a big deal about this.  It's a nervous habit like biting fingernails.  2.  Just start calling him out on it when you see it, and express how seriously this concerns you.  Then be patient.  Most people never really kick habits like this (I still bite my nails occasionally and I'm in my 40's).  Hopefully he'll learn to hide it better.

Kind of a shame for Bill Clinton that he's determined to go out as a whining crybaby.  Hillary lost because she ran a lazy low-energy campaign that ignored states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Assuming that states that no Democrat had lost since Dukakis/Mondale would go for her too.  The Russians didn't interfere one iota in the election. If Russia wanted to elect a President who'd be weak, they would have tried to help Hillary.  The FBI didn't really spark an issue that didn't already exist. That issue is the corruption of Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump won because he ran a positive issues-oriented campaign about making America great again.  Hillary Clinton lost because she didn't have a positive message. Her ads had more clips of Trump than Hillary.

&gt; you literally havent replied with anything besides an inflated opinion of how well you can debate.  You think we are debating?!?!?  You have replied SOLELY with a single simple fallacy!!! You left me with nothing to reply to other than this aforementioned fallacy. There is no debate, and certainly nothing worth bragging about.  ----------------------  Not to mention this:  "I am upset that people are okay with a foreign government manipulating our elections by hacking into our political parties."  ...is IN FACT "literally anything besides" just an opinion of how well I can debate.   ---------------------------------------  Please don't confuse me insulting a dumb fuck like you with me bragging about my abilities to debate. You haven't debated anything, just revealed how stupid and ill informed and (here is an actual brag) out of your league you are.  I will have a great one, and fucking WISH I were 14 years old again.
You should always use a condom with a ONS, even if she says she is on the pill. First, she could be lying and trying to get pregnant (it happens), and secondly and most likely, she could have a STD. It definitely feels better without a condom, and I've had plenty of one night stands without one, but that wasn't exactly smart. Just please do yourself a favor and wear one. Don't be reckless.

&gt;So should I be worried or....   You should do some research.  1000ug is a fuck ton of acid, and AFAIK you probably can't even fit 1000ug on a single blotter. Tabs are usually like 100-250ug.   If you took 1000ug, especially for just your third trip, you'd be blasted off in to hyperspace.   Check with your friend, but I'm guessing they're 100ug tabs, not 1000. If your friend is seriously saying that he has 1000ug tabs, then stop buying acid from him cause he's an idiot.

Look, I get that you're a Conservative libertarian, that's cool with me whatever. But you and I and everyone else knows that the claims being made by the MSM and the government are saying that Russia hacked the DNC and very likely the RNC and selectively released information via WikiLeaks which does not play favorites with sources in a way that influenced the outcome of our election to be as favorable to Russian interests as possible.  Nobody with a position of authority is claiming Russia hacked our election in the sense that they changed votes or rigged machines. Yes, there are people who say that's what happened, but they are regular citizens. There are also regular citizens who thought Trump was anti-establishment and actually cared about anyone outside the upper class, so clearly our nation is full of idiots on all sides. Doesn't change the message being sent out from the intelligence community, which is that Russia manipulated the news to gain favorable outcomes.

The only reason I want to interact with it over USB is to read data. I hadn't thought so much about it beyond that yet but I think that you are right that physical controls are superior. So as long as I can use for example Sigrok to read the data from the scope from Linux I would be happy. Happily 1054z is supported by Sigrok according to the wiki https://sigrok.org/wiki/Rigol_DS1000Z_series. So at this point I am almost certain that 1054z is the one I should go for then. Thanks for your input.

I was thinking about this yesterday! In high school, me and my buddy would go to sephora every paycheck to pick up a new scent. One day I picked up la nuit libre and sprayed it and it was great. He sprayed a bottle that I thought at the time was Thierry mugler a*men. I remember the two combing to create a sugary sweet boozy smell. I tested a*men recently and it wasn't what I remembered and my cologne collection (including the libre) was stolen in college so I can't test the combination. Man I miss that combination.

What are you talking about? Last time I checked, California still had 55 electoral votes. Plus are you forgetting that the EC votes typically go with the popular vote of the state?

WHat I'd do was record myself (in front of the employer) being forced to sign it under protest/duress and then wait til my wages are garnished as punishment... THEN take it to a lawyer, then news station and whatever government employment agency that would handle employee rights.  Note: I live in a One-Party-Consent state where it is legal for me to secretly record ANYONE I am having a conversation with. 
What about walcott? 
This was great! The electric company letter really nailed it for me!

Ugh, I'm all too familiar with the hell of feeling trapped by depression, anxiety, and obsessive thoughts/behaviors.  It makes it SO HARD to take the risks necessary to get well-suited jobs, to make friends, to find romance (or just a hookup for god's sake...).  I've found group therapy (and lexapro) helpful.  Getting to know other people fighting the same demons has been profoundly therapeutic, and has allowed me to give myself permission to "be me" rather than just judge myself harshly.  I can't offer practical help except to say that you certainly are not alone in your feelings or situation. And your post was not at all disordered or hard to follow or anything else bad.  You write well.  You've got a voice, and it comes through.  Oh--big thumbs up on the Slavic studies thing.  5 years of studying Russian and I got to the point where I could speak ok and read well.  But in the 16 years since graduating college, I've not USED it much and there's almost none left in my head.  I think I can recite a few poems and introduce myself...

"The website now states the cause of climate change is debatable. Gone are sentences attributing global warming to human activities and rising carbon dioxide levels.

I've had multiple friends get tickets at Dean Keeton and 35. The excuse (which is understandable) is that it's easy to accelerate going down that hill without really thinking about it if you aren't staring at your speedometer and making a conscious effort to keep your speed down. No one is driving down DK with cruise control on.

Because there's historically been a lot of poverty in regions of the South where the dialects are most divergent from standard American English, and poor people tend to have inadequate education and thus get misrepresented as stupid or backward. As a native speaker of Southern American English (though with a rather weak accent) I can heartily confirm that we are not stupid down here.

This is an amazing series! I loved it. I recommend it to people whenever we get copies at the bookstore I work at. One of my favorite reads. Truly great space opera. 
If the actual title has been branded salvage... and you didn't just find an accident report on the vehicle, you are entitled to legal action in most states. Most dealers would want to unwind your deal and make you whole. That is what we do if this ever happens, but I have only had it happen once or twice and the mistake was caught by our receptionist and quickly rectified. Talk to a local attorney and you can probably give the vehicle back and receive all your payments back. If the title is actually salvage and they did not disclose this to you anywhere, that is a big no no for dealers. Feel free to call your salesman or his manager to address the situation and see if they offer any solutions. Make sure your car actually had a branded title, you may want to pay for a title search or whatever your state offers. A lot of the laws go state to state, so a lot of use won't be very familiar with your states laws. Good luck to you. 
That chocolate stout is by far my favorite beer. Just bought a case last week. 
I have this one female friend that's always unreliable about hanging out.. so her plans for NYE looked like they were falling short, so I invited her out.. few hours go by, figure she wasn't up to coming out (I'm like an hour away, in a city.. she lives in the suburbs) - she then tells me she's not coming up, but invites me over... I tell her no because I had plans, then she gets mad at me for not telling her about those plans when I invited her up -- when we both know she wasn't going to come up ... in conclusion.. I know nothing.
I worked hardware for 10 years.  We have probably 50 - 100 shades of white, lightly tinted with different colors.  At least once a week someone would get visibly upset about not finding a white they want.  "Don't you just have *off white*"  To which I would have to reply, "What do you *mean* by off white?"  Just pick a fucking white jesus it's just paint.
Yes, I know the guidelines for triptans (fewer than 10 a month) and for NSAIDs (fewer than 15 a month). What I can't find is the combined, total meds per month/week guideline. If you take triptans on 10 days a month and NSAIDs on 15 days, that's 25 meds days a month, which is surely too much.  I have seen some articles suggesting 2 meds days total per week, no matter which meds, but that comes in at less than both the triptan and the NSAID guidelines separately, and a third of them combined--seems low.

That's fine. But if you let a 4 year old girl bleed out when you have medical gear and training on your person and choose not to use it, I see the utility in that, you shouldn't  wax "poor me the things I've seen" on facebook about it.  And the fact doesnt change that if you dont want to use your gsw kit on someone else, you can still pack and tie a bleed with any number of things you have on you as a soldier. If you're medically trained by the Army I shouldnt have to tell you that, and if I didnt have to tell you that, then tbe last sentence of your post is categorically wrong and youre just triggered.

The one analogy I though of was that, back then, we were like satelites, or rockets: Only a handful of manufactures that could dictate the rules.  So it felt we were in control, forever and ever, but thats all we were, the only hot girl in the sausage party.  Now a days were like the clothing store, if they can, they will shop online, but otherwise, in a hurry, or to someone that has some extra money will buy locally.
Alcohol is a depressant, so the more you drink, the more buzzed/drunk and tired you will get. There might be more to this, having to do more with the state of being drunk itself, but this is certainly a factor.

So, Ask a Fat Activist? I'm sorry but you need to be able to say something. I'm pretty sure boyfriend here didn't say "Look bitch, the way you look makes me sick and I demand you get off your ass this minute." Her fucking *doctor* has said something to her. She knows. But for Lindsy West to immediately attack him by saying she thinks he doesn't really love the girlfriend is insane and vicious. If your doctor's brought it up it's significant because God knows doctors don't say anything about weight until a problem is apparent.

wtf is this? Japan may not be a resource rich country but you can't starve them to submission. All historians will agree that blockade will not change any country's decision on things essential, such as sovereignty. Look at Iran, Cuba, China, Russia. These countries aren't even face with the issue of surrender, and none of them folded. I can't imagine Japan would fold to a blockade.  Second, Japan may not be rich in minerals and oils necessary for war, but it has been mostly isolationist for centuries, they haven't starved since then, and they won't be starved now. The only thing a blockade would do is kill wokan and children, and then make a land war slightly easier but probably a lot harder as man would be steeled after these losses. It is unimaginable to think Japan a nation size of Japan would surrender to starvation when North Korea hasn't.

https://www.futbin.com/17/squad/868942   Really like how this team has been playing. Have 600k to upgrade (PS4) it while keeping the play style the same.

Thinking of dropping the 600k for Pogba and replacing brozo (and adding florenzi for chem and sliding nain to RCM), but Pogba doesn't seem 500k worth over brozo.  I was debating just getting IF Kante and Walker, or maybe replacing icardi (he's new but been playing well). Idk, help me out.

I'm currently leveling a new character from 4 to 30 solely in Survival (currently level 25).I'm having a lot of fun doing it but I'm not sure I would recommend it.   You can't use the gear you get as a reward because it is all high end (ie you have to be level 30 to equip it). Also, once you do hit 30 the gear that you do get will mostly only be gear score 163 and will be useless very quickly.   Also, it's pretty slow as you need three to four successful extractions per level to level up and that is 2 hours each session, assuming you extract.   However, if you just love the mode as I do then it is worth it. Also you could just alternate and run a couple Survival runs then do some story missions or events to mix it up.

Well, if the polls during the US election were accurate, then people were either duped or lived in an impossible utopia type scenario. And the polls could easily have been accurate, considering that an almost total, complete confidence in one candidate might make you less likely to actually vote. Meanwhile, Trump supporters were convinced that Hillary was rigging the election, so obviously the vast majority of Trump's supporters voted to help him win.

My ideas,  But if the densities of two gases are different, then to have both equal molecules and equal volume, the psi must be different. Which would pull water into the container to reduce the volume.  O2 combines with C to make a more dense gas. The increase in density reduces the pressure, which pulls water which reduces volume.

some of us want to compress time frames by having certain things delivered while we are working from home for our careers, so we have more time for ourselves.  I don't disagree, it is nice to go to the supermarket to pick up stuff but having this option is really nice (and sometimes really good deals).
Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. He is rich who owns the day, and no one owns the day  who allows it to be invaded with fret and anxiety.  Finish every day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities, no doubt crept in. Forget them as soon as you can, tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely, with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.  This new day is too dear, with its hopes and invitations, to waste a moment on the yesterdays.  -Emerson
Reporting from 2017, probably the least festive New Year celebration in history. Did you know that Israel apparently doesn't celebrate New Year? Not a single firework heard. Partygoer noise standard/low for a weeknight. My eyes are still burning from all the crying about petty bullshit and ringing them with glitter to sit in bed which boyfriend said was very "empowered" of me. 5 minutes to midnight we were still frantically searching for a Lithuanian or Israeli Russian TV stream so we could at least look at a clock countdown but everything was seemingly overloaded so we gave up and watched a metal finger guide us through sarcastic Bible verses (something to the tune of "he who closes Channel 1 is an enemy of the children of Israel" or whatever) and then some obscure Syrian news report while the laptop clock turned to 00.00 and I opened a bottle of a drink called "Buzz". The store didn't have champagne or fizzy wine except this and lambrusco. I played "Auld Lang Syne" and ABBA's "Happy New Year" on Youtube and gave a sociocultural lecture to boyfriend how in Europe this is a celebration of regrets, hangovers and a wasted year. This "Buzz" thing isn't enough to give even my fucked up liver a hangover though, it's like beer strength. You had one job...  Got to watch "Dinner for One" which is a pretty creepy German NYE standard and the traditional first part of "Irony of Fate" though, so that was pretty festive. Feasting on almond paste and Ensure Plus. Goodnight everybody!

It's entirely possible that this was legit and it's entirely plausible based on what has been said about pride and fighting in Japan in general that the fight was fixed. I can say from experience that the seemingly weakest body shots can really fuck you up if they land right and at the right time

In much of Eastern Europe, they didn't call the Germans Nazis, they called them Fascists.  There's an overlap.  Not all fascists are nazis, but all nazis are fascists.

Hunger Gamesy is just the way I can describe it easily. I bring it up because it seems like people just bring that up naturally as I describe the story to them -- "Oh! Like the Hunger Games?" And then I sigh and say "Sure."  The district part of it revolves around the literal districting of the city. The City is (presumably) the last vestige of human civilization left, and a number of different cultures intermingle there. Think of the districts as more informal, ie "Chinatown". Those informal delineations nonetheless are chock full of cultural differences (some holdovers, some newer, more alien mixes) and naturally, people that are different from each other tend to trust each other less.  I'm trying to focus more on classism than racism, but the latter is going to exist.  Think of it like "Oh, you're from the *Ardin* Quarter." Real world: "Oh, you're from [insert ghetto part of town here]. I guess you wouldn't understand." Theoretically there's freedom of movement, sure, but class warfare is an important tool of the elite.  The Hunger Games part of my story solely revolves around the Arena, in which the condemned souls must work together and are promised freedom if they survive. I guess referencing the Hunger Games is a bit of a misnomer since it IS a very different story.

Yeah, that would. Reposting with different title. 
Its actually a concern how many people revere stats over everything else - including in this case the global development of the game.   "No we can't possibly let anyone else play our insular little game in case someone accidentally scores some runs and they appear in my record book"
If he's getting to the final stages there is a better way to relay that same information in a way that doesn't make it seem negative.

I had this happen to me with nutcracker soldiers at Christmas. I showed my mother one in a store when I was a kid that I thought looked cool. She ended up giving it to me as a Christmas gift - that somehow turned into a tradition of giving me a nutcracker every year, which passed on to my wife doing it a couple years ago.  I now have multiple storage boxes of nutcrackers - most of which have never been displayed or even opened. I don't have the heart to tell my mom or wife that I really don't need or want dozens of nutcrackers.

I hope to god they don't do Roman vs Strowman.   I really like the way they are handling Strowman right now, and I can't see that match going any other way than Roman overcoming Strowman, and I think that will kill any momentum Strowman has.
The solution is to nerf Poppy's damage. Tanks have to be that tanky because they're supposed to be getting hit by 2 or 3 people with multiple types of damage. If Draven (or any ADC) was 3-5 shotting Poppy (who's 2 levels up, etc., etc.) imagine how instantaneously Poppy would die in a team fight when she's also getting hit by mage burst, probably mage support burst, probably some AD from the jungler, etc. Tanks would be utterly worthless.  EDIT: and there's usually an outlier on the tankiness scale that's a bit too tanky, maybe this season its Poppy. I seem to recall seeing a Mundo clip from Season 3 where he was standing under tower tanking it for like 2 minutes straight, pops ult and heals to full (without breaking turret aggro), tanks for another minute, pops ult and heals to full, tanks for another 30 or so seconds, it was obscene. So Poppy probably needs some nerfs to her tankiness too but at the end of the day you shouldn't really see a tank outright lose a 1v1 to anyone (though they shouldn't "win" it either).

Even if you plan to return to the US between jan and may, I would  still apply for an extension of the residency permit without letting it lapse   anything else just looks fishy as fuck

Hi, thanks for your input! Unfortunately, I live an hour away from them and being around to do things like sort his pills weekly and make sure he's taking his antidepressants would be very difficult. I know he sometimes takes Xanax for his anxiety, I'm not sure if he's taking it while in the home or if it would help with depression though. My only experience with antidepressants was a negative one, but I've been looking into them for myself lately. Maybe I can have a conversation with him about asking his doctor himself without mom around.

Decades ago i was 10 years old. On December 31 I was over at my best friends house, spending the day playing. Out of the blue he invited me to stay overnight and celebrate the new years eve, watching the ball drop with him and his family. I was only 10 years old and naive me never heard of celebrating new years eve. My friends description of the event only confused me more. "Times Square. Watch a ball drop, etc."   Still, I agreed. I called up my mother to get her permission to stay over (My friend didnt live in my neighborhood. I had to take a bus to get to and from his place). Mother gave her permission. My friend lived in an apartment. His older adult sister had her own apartment right down the hallway on the same floor of his building. It was there where we all were to celebrate new years eve. They had not only my friends family, but many other friends and also plenty of food, snacks, and drinks.  Now, I was being raised in an abusive, dysfunctional home. My parents split up when I was young, about 5-6 years old. Mother got custody of us kids and she was a mentally ill, mean, abusive psychotic. But my friends sister was sweet as pie to me and everyone around her. So, the countdown came. As soon as the ball dropped and it was the new year, everyone in the place cheered, hugged and kissed and even my friends sister gave me a kiss on the cheek. I was stunned and surprised at the outpouring of happiness and affection this occasion caused. I knew nothing but misery in my home.  Fast forward one year later. Again, the night of December 31. I'm home this evening (no invitation forthcoming from my friend). My mother tries to send me to bed at my usual bedtime (9pm). I ask her to let me stay up to watch the new years times square celebration and watch the ball drop on tv. She agreed to let me.   Actually, I couldnt have cared less about new years eve and the ball drop. My true, real motive for wanting to watch it on tv was that I hoped it would recreate in my sad, depressing, miserable, abusive, dysfunctional home the same joy and happiness I witnessed over at my friends sisters place the year before, if only for a minute or so. But it was not to be.  We had no friends or family over. No refreshments of any kind. Just the tv. It was only me and mother in the living room, watching the ball drop. Mother was sitting on the couch, i was sitting on the floor. As soon as the ball dropped, the VERY second it dropped and it was the new year, my mother swiveled her head to look at me. Did I get a "happy new year"? Nope. With an angry expression on her face, she YELLED at me at the top of her lungs, "ALL RIGHT, ITS OVER!!!! GO TO BED!!!!!" Without a word, I got up and silently made the trek to my bedroom while thinking of the obvious, stark contrast between my sad, miserable home, and the happy home of my friends sister.   At the home of my friends sister, they welcome in the new year with a party. Family, friends, food, champagne, cheers, hugs, kisses, love, joy, and happiness. ("5, 4, 3, 2, 1...Happy New Year!")  At my  home the new year is welcomed with my psychotic mother yelling at me. ("5, 4, 3, 2, 1..."ALL RIGHT, IT'S OVER!!!! GO TO BED!!!!")  I have NEVER celebrated the new years or watched any of the live times square coverage since then. And it will be the same thing tonight.   TL;DR: Haven't celebrated the new year due to my mothers abuse many years ago.

I couldn't tell from a quick check of the REI site whether that's still true if the item is defective. Fenix does have a distributor in the US though and I expect you'll have no trouble getting a warranty replacement.
&gt;1.) I don't have to check all the trainers he battles, all I need to check in order for my stats to line up is his last 50 battles.  Except that isn't his last 50 battles. What you're checking is just 50 battles at random. I don't watch his videos personally but from looking at his channel he seems to play a lot of dumb teams. this would mean there is a lot of behind the scenes failure that you arent looking into. It could be wholly possible that 75% of his battles are against nicknamed pokemon and we are only seeing the few without.  &gt;I highly doubt he posts only trainers with no nicknamed Pokemon on purpose.   Nobody said it had to be on purpose, it is wholly possible it is just a coincidence. Again another factor you're missing.  &gt;3.) Although that might be true, it is practically impossible.  It doesn't matter how low the chance is. The fact is that YOU YOURSELF proved it possible. Regardless of how insignificant the chance it would be incredibly stupid  of you to say that his situation is impossible and you are right. You haven't "proven" a single thing.

Honestly, you're one of my favourite mapmakers and not just for the occasionally brilliant map name.

I finished The Witness earlier this month. I can see why some folks might be keeping notes and taking lots of screenshots, but whether or not you'll need to will come down to how you think, and more specifically how good you are at visualization, most specifically visualizing rotations and translations in 2D space. Also I suppose to a lesser degree, how good you are at remembering mechanics once you've learned them.  This isn't the kind of game where you really must make notes about details so that you can use them later. You'll run into a new puzzle type and a handful of simple puzzles that teach you how to solve that type of puzzle, and I guess some people make notes on that, but for me once I learned a new mechanic I remembered it pretty well, and if I forgot I could always go back to the early puzzles to remind myself.  The cases where I did end up making notes were more of a scratch-paper kind of thing, like, I'm having trouble visualizing this so I need to map it out so I can think it through more easily. I ended up with a handful of envelopes on my desk covered in scribbles while I tried to think through a tricky path or complex mechanic. You might not need that at all, or you might need a whole bunch of envelopes, but just bear in mind it's scratch paper you'll need most and probably not so much rigorous notes for their own sake.

What is an isn't heresy could be debated in these parts ad infinitum, and there would never be consensus because the definition of what that is changes between denominations. Technically, not only does it still make it a 1.4 (personal attack) violation, but also a form of interdenominational flaming. This is why we typically don't allow it in this context.
My point is that the OS should have one fixed monotonic timescale and that users should be able to choose the one they use and it should be managed through a library. TAI, UTC and local time should all be valid ways of referencing time. The only sticky point is that you need to be sure when you do this that there can be an arbitrary number of seconds in any given minute, minutes in any given hour, hours in any given day, days in any given month, etc. recalling that one year we removed a large number of days from the month!   I suspect such a system is "normally we have 60 seconds a minute,60 minutes an hour and so on" but here are some deltas and the library reads those deltas and computes differences for you.   This not only keeps the user happy but keeps the kernel's timekeeping explicitly separated from the users so that the needs of the user doesn't interfere with the needs of the OS in the same way that the needs of one group of users (assurance that their computers won't all crash at once) is currently interfering with the needs of another group of users (assurance that seconds are being measured as accurately as reasonable or that they can compare the time on any of a group of computers and they will be as close to each other as reasonably possible, even if they are using different time sources within the same time network).   Towards that end I think POSIX needs to define the internal representation of time, something based on TAI, but should also define the external representation of time, something that translates from the new "UNIX time" to human time similar to how GPS does it. 
You have to take in account that not every player has all 66 cards, soon to be 70. You want players to be punished for the cards they want to use and the players that don't have access to these "meta" and non "meta" cards.

My commute is an hour long one way, but I'm on campus 5-7 days per week. My work is highly experimental and my office computer has many programs that I don't have access to at home. Some days I will stay at home and work using remote desktop, but I usually go in because I find it much easier to focus in my office.
is this game worth it on mobile?
Ah I don't think so, I see what you mean! The original diner is in Old Lestallum, but I don't think Kenny is even there, or maybe he is? Obviously not a memorable man but his salmon will go on...

I still don't understand how only one game older than ten years was nominated for the Test of Time award.
"Yep. They're kinda my best friends."
Let's overreact after the first lost by Canada and asume that since he was shit this game, he must be a shit player. 
Thank you! I just used wine bottles and I keep my eye out at second hand stores for cream/white candles (they're so expensive new!). 
If he wouldn't have dedicated every post-BPITU moment to destroying Dick by whatever means necessary I meant have some sympathy for him. Everything he's done since the break up makes me think he deserves everything that's happened to him and more.

no problem &lt;3 i'm glad you're doing better now. i missed seeing your kind comments on peoples' posts. 
Do you have A3Launcher?
I've never played GTA V, so maybe I'm missing something, but I don't understand at all how it got "Whooooaaa dude!", I've seen gameplay footage and nothing spectacular seems to happen.
My parents always forced me to wear a helmet when i went snowboarding as a kid, i hated it cause it didnt  look cool. As an adult im glad they forced me and i use it every time i go snowboarding now
Thanks man!
Mmmm sounds like a yummy dinner!  what do you plan on watching on Netflix?  I almost never watch it, but I should!
yep, this whole thing made me appreciate that.  I'll break those commands up.  It's a small little thing just to tear down these installs.  So it doesn't need to be clean or pretty.  Just functional.  And I didn't realize motherboards had a physical reset button.  Thanks!
Currently working at target. Every single item in the store is by the each. When I see what I'm about to grab it tells me I have 20 eaches. Never understood why 
I don't remember much talk of politics in *Stranger,* other than the free-love stuff, but to be fair, it's been almost a decade since I read it.

Just started a dex/faith build focusing on dual weapons and lightning blade, any advice?
sorry... not much of a grammar buff
Sounds like a good call. Nice solid food to pad your stomach with. Hope it's great.
Guillotine still not banned though, right? 
I'm pretty sure all that info is stored on the HDD.
Loads.  Absolute loads of stuff.  I work from theme to mechanisms to game play.  My designs become bloated during the mechanism stage because I am too fascinated by clever mechanisms. In my latest design (a worker placement with lots of resource conversion and special rule breaking actions)  I have forced myself to think through to the game play before accepting the mechanism. A few mechanisms I decided I would use, but only if the player will not spend more than about twenty seconds in an average interaction with that mechanism. Speed of use does not make a better mechanism,  but considering speed does force me to make a simpler mechanism. My personal joke is that since I like "clever" mechanisms I must make them "Too clever by half", meaning I must make them half as long. It is too complicated to be funny to anyone else, but it is working very well as a design practice.  
Wow, what a long comment, that I'm sure is filled with further delusion. I'm not taking the time to read it, either, lmao.

Like you said, Pepe is definitely a staple meme in the market. I also find that rickrolls, though uncommon today, still do fairly well. 
As a nation that can not be a good thing and trump assuming the office of the president is the result with more consequences to come.

While there is not much for learning the actual market, I would disagree on 'absolutely NOTHING for finance' - 'lemonade stand' has existed in the gaming world since the 70's and was probably my first exposure to business mechanics as a child in the 80's...
I don't entirely disagree with you, but the funny thing is I just don't know many women who would use that excuse. I agree that if it's because she's less attracted to him yeah that's a shit deal.

Oh, how I do wish I knew what I was doing. The best advice I can offer is restarting homebrew and see if it works again the second time if you haven't yet - sometimes it can be a little finicky (it froze for me the first time I tried it just now).  There are other save managers out there - no idea how they'd work with Sun/Moon, and they're a lot clunkier to use. I used [sdvt](https://github.com/meladroit/svdt) for the longest time, but I'd try getting JKSM to work before trying that, as svdt is no longer actively maintained.  What's the exact error you're getting, word for word? Also, if you're not terrified of people like I am, you can ask in the questions thread over at /r/3dshacks, someone there definitely knows what they're doing.

Unfortunately buddy, hate to be the bear of bad news I went on my account after like a year of not ordering anything, put up300$ of someone else's money.....And thought it was a 4 digit pin, didn't think I really needed that phrase, money still stuck in limbo. Since you have that phrase you have a chance though. I would take it down though no reason anyone needs to see it.
That's what I did when it came out!

That would require me to have friends in the area who are willing to do that.  So far that's not something that seems to be possible.  I'd be lucky to meet someone around my own age who isn't wrapped up in dating and babies.
That's what they did in Asteria which they really should of brought over in Link. Cuz they give us a guarenteed awakened 5s at the end of it, but you only have 3 choices and it's random. But you can do it over and over again
I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with your advice regarding order of classes to play.  My advice to OP - play whoever the hell looks fun to you. Borderlands 2 was the first game I played, and I chose Zer0 as my first character because his skills looked cool. I played him all the way to OP8 and did not regret it at all. Sure, it was hard the first time I started UVHM, but I had a ton of fun learning the ins and outs of Zer0's skills.  You shouldn't switch to an easier class because you keep dying. You should just get better with Zer0. It's a game. You're going to have fun regardless (I hope).
That is bananas! I never knew, thanks.
It shows your name if your healing or boosting, thats your recognition. Plus your healing and boosting isn't making the play, but supporting it. That's your role as a support hero.

because they (yours) are tied to a pokestop, duuh.  but these I know are 3 without any pokestop nearby and 1 with a clusterspawn near pokestop. the first 3 spawn regularly grimers, eevees, vaporeons, omanites, magicarps, lapras, snorlax and even 1 time a dragonite. I found them because I saw the rares in the 200m and caught them every time in the same spot.

Chicago electrician here, your conduit system serves as a ground so you likely won't have a ground wire (I haven't seen one in residential work around here in a decade of work).  Just make sure your conduits are properly connected back to the panels (the one conduit to Greenfield all taped together looked sketchy).  Otherwise, replacing that panel is a must and should mitigate most potential problems.

Try turning down the graphics options as low as you can. If that helps, push them up a bit at a time until you find a balance. I also wouldn't recommend running your rift over USB 2.0. The sensor *maybe*, but not the rift.  I'd recommend an upgrade anyway. I was just getting by with an i5 2500k for VR. That CPU is weaker. The USB issue is easy to solve with the Oculus recommend USB 3.0 Inatek card. The CPU is obviously a bigger issue. What's your GPU? That's arguably more important for VR.

Not to mention that their argument is an outright logical fallacy, to assume that since men live on average five years less than women that it is *because* they're men that that's the case.  Then again these are tumblrinas. I was wrong to think even for a nanosecond that they have a basic understanding of rudimentary logic.

It didn't necessarily 'work out' it's just the reality of the atmosphere composition currently. Populations of animals that couldn't survive with today's atmosphere haven't, and species that can, do. The atmosphere has changed quite a bit over the history of the earth (abundant to non-existant Oxygen/C02 at various times). Living things that can take advantage of what's in the air and use it to survive are the ones that succeed.  One common example of this is the dinosaurs. They were able to be gigantic  (and thereby consume more food) because there was MUCH more oxygen in the air during that time. An animal that large couldn't be successful in today's atmosphere, and that's why there aren't any anymore.  So, in summary, the organisms that have survived in the world are the ones able to take advantage of the air in their environment and use it to be successful!

Your puppy's entering teenagedom. I'm very stressed about my puppy going through this phase. Hang in there. A pup's teenage years are the years that pups are most likely to be abandoned. They do get better and while they may never go back to being the eager-to-please pup that you have, they do grow out of teenage years and back in to listening as long as you're persistent.

He's also capitalizing on a depressed and lost new generation of people. Suicide rates and depression rates are up among the youth. Millenials report their biggest desire in a new job to be a sense of job satisfaction, of making an impact. You have all these young people adrift, feeling purposeless and without a strong sense of self. Anything that seems like it will Make A Big Change is liable to attract their support.

I understand your frustration at being ditched last minute. However she's probably been friends with these people for a long time so don't take it as an insult. Give her a second chance, and I'm sure there's some party somewhere you can attend last minute. Don't let one girl get you down on NYE!  I agree with you letting her being the one to make the next move though. If she wants to keep seeing you then she'll text you. Just don't wait too long for her to get back to you.

Skank here. There's more strip clubs than bath houses. There's more straight clubs than gay clubs. There's more sex at Mardi Gras than pride.  There's more straight people fucking during spring break than any large gay sex parties. I've been to both. They were all amazing though and fun. You're too miserable and depressed to understand that not everybody is suffering on the inside like you so sex is great for lots of us. Yet another thing you'll not get to enjoy, probably for your entire "life".

That is where you are wrong. Ponting, Sanga, etc were lauded *because* they setup matches for their teams. The individual stats SR and AVG just back that knowledge up. You don't need to see the stats if you watched them play.  I watched them and I watched Kallis.  Cricket is not about individual accolades to most. That's a shallow and meaningless goal in a team sport like cricket. The best sides like Waugh and Pontings aussies played the scoreboard to win the match, not their individual runs.

Thanks for the info. Yeah I was pretty happy with how she was looking for it being her first ever equipped benching. You're probably right about her butt, we'll be she's to set up the camera to check for that next time. I'll also take your advice about making her hold on to it and control it and make everything very clear. As far as upper back goes she's got that on lock haha. That's definitely her strongest point.

Haven't even touched fluid physics yet, but might I hypothesize that; even though the water already began rising before the flame was extinguished, it only filled the space that wasn't being warmed by the flame, therefore, had cooled and experienced lower pressure. Only when the flame extinguished, the pressure in the upper parts of the glass decreased, and the water rose further.  E: I no grammar good.
A bit over the top, but that stupid The Costumer is always right, rule it could be like, you tell a costumer "The Black Plague has spread here, you must leave" 'I don't see anything serve me" 'but there are people dying on the floor with black oozing cysts all over there bodies" "Nope sorry don't see a thing Manager" Manager comes over "what the problem" "your employee is lying to me" "well obviously you are lying to this women your fired"   Dying Victim clings to managers leg "stop the pain please" Manager "you'll never work in this town again.....here is some free food ma/am"   A week later "I'm sick you got me sick I'm suing"  
This fight is about luck. You only have 30 sec to get the first l2 off and make it land. When you do this hit him as much as you can. You need to get him to double his regen. Then you will be getting souls back and hit with another l2 and go for another stack of regen.   The reason I say luck is because of timing. I died 5 times there and had a friend beside me saying "all you have to do is l2."  I got mad and handed it to him. He tried once and died. Then asked for another shot. 1.5 min later wolvie was dead.   Almost better to go in after him with a 99 duped widow. He will never heal
Yes. 
Thanks for the comment. I understand why you would mention clothes not smelling like Indian food. I appreciate your honesty. I apply deodarant and body spray regularly and try to wash clothes after 2 or 3 times of use. So I think it should be fine.  Also, I do have another pair of glasses which I rarely use.

Those eyes! I don't think I've ever seen a spider's eyes look so human - somehow it looks like pupils and irises (I know they don't have those)  Great work, any clue on scale? Maybe ~10mm diameter?
Yeah 99 and the manga(the most) have a much darker tone.
This is **very** good advice, very lucid. I don't see how a better advice could be given. Amen, brother.
Awesome. I would take the help!

no, that doesnt sound like me. i am male, 6'4", and 175 pounds. pretty skinny. this seems to affect pregnant women and obese individuals  and no offense was taken, i appreciate your concern

So now?  (just turned 2017 where I am as i hit send) 
Wishing everyone a happy and safe new year's!!

Hurr hurr.
That's like suing a gun manufacturer for a someone killing someone with a gun. Get some sense. People who drive while under the influence are the problem, not the drugs themselves.
