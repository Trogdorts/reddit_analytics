Silence...I guess that is your answer.
So I‚Äôve often wondered this...  Like I know most politicians don‚Äôt know a lot of what‚Äôs going on. And like you said, need-to-know basis. So I‚Äôve always wondered...who *does* know all the dirty secrets, confidential information, and hidden doors, so to speak? Like what person or group knows all the shit that goes on behind closed doors?  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs some people no one‚Äôs ever heard of which would make sense. But it‚Äôs just fascinating that there‚Äôs a layer below the politics and general government where shit actually happens. 
I actually dig this 
Hey we all need that reminder sometimes. Future you in a love affair with life will thank current you for your contributions.
Yeah, mine is...okay with it.  He seems to want to pick up shit just to fuck with me. And he really likes for me to have something to offer and waits for it. 
Oh it rolls up too? Awesome! Most cars that have the auto down won't do up, for safety concerns or some shit

Weight is related to your jumping ability in that explosiveness is measured in power to weight ratio. Lighter people have less weight, but also less muscle to generate power. Heavier people can have more muscle to generate power, but also have that extra weight that the have to move with that power. So the important thing is finding that fantastic middle ground where you have the maximal power to move your weight.  Don‚Äôt worry about judging yourself against LeBron. The man is an athletic and genetic freak. A freight train. He is pushing what we consider to be human limits. One of the most interesting parts of LeBrons life from a physiological point of view will be what happens to his body once he retires and starts to get old, because at the moment he seems to be defying age.  (Sorry for the spiel) For you though, just remember that adding muscle and weight may make you more explosive if you train right, but that also means more weight for that power to then move.  Best of luck!
They're only replacing the sign when it gets worn out, no extra money is being spent
How does the haakaa work? I never understood it. Are you supposed to attach it to the other boob when baby is feeding, and it catches the letdown so it doesn't get wiped away and wasted? Does the hakaa actually induce any suction or pumping? I never got letdown with the other boob when the baby was feeding.  That's a great amount too, good for you!
Can confirm. Source? Am source.
I seriously doubt there's a town in the entirety of Massachusetts where it's a matter of *chance* whether or not you get a restricted license though.
Broadly, perhaps.  This would be a replacement of the current tax system though, not additional. Remove all other company taxes and implement an inescapable yet highly attractive, simple sliding scale based on revenue.  I mean, a small % of a very big pie is better than 0% of a smaller (same as now) pie.  Market it so that companies *want* to be paying tax here in Australia.

Just take a look at Tiger.  He absolutely dominated the competition.  Then one day, snap. Done.   The difficult part of golf isn't physical, its mental.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not trolling.  Most of the reason why men are here is because they were unattractive and overlooked in the dating/courtship realm or their wives "loved them but weren't in love with them."  Attraction matters because most of them are obtained from being successful with God's marital roles and responsibilities matter. As a husband gets better at the Scriptural roles and responsibilities, he will become an excellent masculine leader, protector, and provider which are attractive to women.   This increase in attraction will tend to jump start their sex life in marriage again, and for singles it will increase the percentage of women that will accept when they ask them out on dates.  The fact that we have to discuss attraction in the first place sucks because the Church won't do it. What pastor is going to tell their singles congregation that they should hit the weights and get on a good nutrition plan to become more attractive to women if they want to go on more dates and lessen the chance of rejection? What pastor is going to tell their married couples that obesity is unattractive to both husbands and wives and that's a reason why their frequency of sex is decreasing? I'll believe it when I see it.
You know, as fucked up as it is, I still miss her. I‚Äôll find myself wanting to call and tell her about my day or what the kids are up to. But I hold my ground because I know that any contact will not be good.

ubreakifix came into being in 2009 because a guy's friend broke his iPhone, or something. I forget. I remember they would learn from their friend's broken phones how to take them apart, and experiment how to fix them doing, buying broken phones on ebay and detailing painfully how they went about the process.  There are now hundreds of ubreakifix stores. Life uhh...finds a way.

Teams go in phases. This season is perfect to rebuild, no one can shit on your after a treble of champions leagues. Manager resigned, best player wanted to leave. Sell of those on the wrong side of 30 for huge sums, hold it, see what the team and manager can do for a season (even the bench can make top 4), then reinvest heavily next season with no World Cup hype and an entire season to scout and recruit top talents.
Thank you! I enjoy Halo 3's multiplayer for the most part, but I can't STAND Halo 3 BTB. I absolutely love Halo: CE and Halo 2 BTB.

This is the saddest attempt at trying to live in a fantasy world I've ever seen. It's so glaringly clear that she is as poor as dirt and can't rub two coins together. The desperation to escape that reality has become so overwhelming that she's resorted to posting stories about how well off she is and how her every day efforts to keep herself fed and out of poverty are just because of how hard she worked to escape poverty.    It's like one of those movies where a child is in a wonderful fantasy world full of magic and adventure, but in the end it turns out they are dying in hospital and it's all in their head.
This completely made my whole day! Listening to them again brought me actual joy!

My sister and I used to put bonnets on our Burmese and then we'd tuck him into a cradle...no wonder he's so twitchy, poor guy. She definitely sounds like she's your girl. It's always so much fun to see which people bond with what pets, and how that expresses itself. My boyfriend's kitten does it through draping all over my boy's face, and my fat kitty's favorite person is my dad. That is expressed through being very sad if my dad is out of eyeshot.   Cats are so fussy lol. Gotta love them even when they're dramatic. 
RIP FrankerZ :(
My family has been pretty awful during the wedding planning. His family treats me like I'm the only woman on the earth and I'm blessing them with my existence. It's the most humbling thing ever, so amazing, and makes me shake my fist at my family who has a history of treating me poorly. It's a good thing I live in his home state, not mine. 
Ah, nice.  I always thought that one was a bit crazy, though it was funny when you failed an install and gained the smart mutation or something like it.

He was committed to a mental health facility, where he just walked out without being noticed by staff, and he was on medication in 2005 until he decided not to take it anymore.  In my mind, the point at which he decided to forgo medical treatment is the point at which he accepted responsibility for his actions. Like a drunk person consciously deciding to get behind the wheel of a car while intoxicated.
Why is everyone complaining about Bayleigh. She games a hell of a lot more than some of these HGs. Shes playing pretty hard and its fun to watch. Is she infuriating at times? Sure, but thats what makes her decent TV.  No one wants some sort of koombayah on feeds.
I did it over 3 weeks ago. Was difficult for me to do the 16/8 because I would just forget and eat outside window. Switched to 20/4 for one day and felt it was rediculous to have to do dishes twice. Went to OMAD and haven't looked back. Down 15lbs including water. Lifts still going up every session (just rocked 505x6 deadlift yesterday- go me), and weight going down daily. Just so much easier to stuff my face once per day and not have to worry about food. Downside is I kind of crash hard for an hour after "the feeding". 
Yeah, the game is definitely good. It‚Äôs just shitty in what little live service it manages to do

Create something to censor it? Bad usernames will be skipped? More than likely the best player in the game won't have a bad username either because there account will have been banned before being a higher tier player, I dunno.

The CGI at the 8 second mark didn't even hold up in the theatre. It's the only part other than Banner with the helmet down with the hulkbuster that threw me off with his new suit or any of the other CGI. I always wonder if it would be simpler and funnier to have them emote through the suit rather then take the helmet off.  Like when Thor lands and Banner is like "You're in trouble now". I'd rather watch and hear him say that through the suit as hulk buster.
Being primarily a solo sloop this event is looking like it‚Äôs going to be a nightmare for me. Just ran into an alliance of multiple galleons at Golden Sands who stole my sloop when I tried starting the campaign and proceeded to kill me when I scuttled, making me go all the way back to Golden Sands again.  So yeah, seems to me like there‚Äôs still fighting to the death but with crews working together.
The missions I played so far had a much more Halo feel, which is awesome. On spark, holding back and taking out all the heavy shanks rather then just running up on all enemies was really fun. And that boss fight was totally unexpected!  I would love to have the option of playing the campaign on a harder difficulty on the first playthrough!

Thank you for your service and I hope your needs are being met now!
Here's the unfortunate thing with me - if it's predictable, I'm not going to like it.  Most recent example -  Before the seminar began, we were in the break room with the professors &amp; one of the was talking about how one of his students thanked him. He said "If I had only a few days left to live..".  I burst out laughing at this point, because I saw where this joke was going. The professor continued "... I'd like to spend it in your class". He said he asked why. The student replies "Because in your class, a minute feels like a year". I was done 2 sentences ago.  Or even in Captain America - Civil War, when Cap meets Spidey for the first time - I literally said Cap's line for him, with him. Paraphrasing below. Cap - "Where're you from?" Spidey - "Queens" Cap - "Brooklyn" Saw that coming.  Yesterday, when I was watching a Bo Burnham stand up - I caught something before Bo himself said it.  To put it simply I like jokes that are novel.  But, that's just me. I can't speak for all.

I'm a BA/MA psychology and same. It's not because we're not invested in the field but because diagnosing fictional characters is pointless. Diagnosis is mostly so that you can have something to put down on the insurance forms; it's not necessary to label someone in order to treat them. Plus, since they're fictional characters, unless you're planning on writing fanfiction, you're not going to be treating them.  Or the opposite, in a way. I recently watched the Patrick Melrose miniseries. You don't need to be a psychologist to say "being molested as a child screwed him up." In other words, what's wrong with most fictional characters is blatantly obvious.

i asked the same question. its due to the expanding universe. space itself is expanding, and it pushes the photons. thats how the observable universe can be so big even though the universe itself isnt that old i.e. its 13billion years whereas light has seemingly travelled 45 billion lightyears   edit: i could be wrong. i asked on this sub before and tbh the answers werent comprehensive.  bizzare to think about expanding space's effects on photons.

In the case of the Tau, I believe their core worlds are beyond the light of the Astronomican, although I might be wrong on that. Regardless, the Tau are a nuisance, rather than a threat, and when faced with real threats like Hive Fleets, Ork Waagh! and Black Crusades and Plague Wars, they haven't really got the time or resources to launch a crusade against the Tau right now.

I don‚Äôt get what is with your hostility, but whatever suits your style of talking to people.   Also that‚Äôs a purely subjective opinion, some people would rather just beat the game.  And honestly, you might be right, maybe it truly is impossible.  I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to actually search for someone who has done it before.  I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that hard of a map to the point that it would be impossible.
Marvel doesn‚Äôt need silly things like speed force. Even in dc, Superman is pretty fast without speed force. 
It's a real shame for sure. Players often try to find some kind of compromise with the TO to make sure they can play multiple games without holding up brackets too much, but for a guy in Leffen's position who likely has a realistic shot at top 8 in smash but would have to win a lot of matches in DBFZ where people still wouldn't bet on him, good on him for making a call.

I see it as being able to live the lifestyle you want without having to rely on paid work or benefactors (eg parents}.  The assets and investments required to generate the necessary income to support it vary wildly between individuals. 100x? 1000x?  Lower tiers may or may not be at the level perceived to be "rich". 
Moreover, any iconic role model of today's standards will always be flawed in some way. But we as a society seek to revere the good, commendable qualities of a person and try to incorporate them in our lives.  Similarly, Gatsby was flawed in various ways; Fitzgerald is not suggesting to be Gatsby but rather, be *like* Gatsby. That is, incorporate some of Gatsby's admirable qualities.  "His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him."   One of Gatsby's greatest flaws was his stubbornness to move on and to stop living in the past. However, at the same time, Gatsby's passion, desire to succeed, and unwavering motivation is quite respectable. 
&gt; I think it might be right since it's from mirror.co.uk   The Mirror is a horrendous source to be honest. But I'm not sure if it's the right figure.  &gt; the reason to why this fight isn't happening right now is because of Eddie Hearn   \+Shelly Finkel if we're being fair. But no point going over the same things as already has been said.  &gt; Eddie Hearn already admitted it on an IFLTV interview with Carl Froch where he said that Carl Froch is right about saying that Eddie Hearn's job as the promoter is to not fight boxers as dangerous as Wilder and instead fight easier opponents.   Do you have the link or remember the title?

I've just learned about macros from these lovely people. Stay under carbs 20g-25g. Try to meet your calculated protein macro. Fat is not necessary to reach the macro its a limit. Your body has fat it will burn as you eat good protein sources cooked in or with healthy fats and stay low carb. But I too havent felt very hungry lately and struggle to reach my goals. IF 16:8. Im trying to have a dense meal of good protein to make sure I'm eating enough but rarely do. Going to save this post to follow!
That's probably a phase.
&gt; I found it extremely interesting that the show chose to showcase the extreme dichotomy between both Sansa and Daenerys when it came to not only dealing with the shortage of food, but general ruling as well. Sansa's scenes in S7 showed her being primarily concerned about preparing for winter and helping her people, while Daenerys was destroying Westerosi lands, threatening her advisors, and making awful ruling decisions (her decision to go save Jon at the wall being her dumbest)  Excellent observation about the food issue... thanks for this. 
This is the epitome of waste in public office
huh?
You should read all what Wes Morriston have written about the argument if you haven't already, some of his papers are [available online](http://spot.colorado.edu/~morristo/selected-papers.html)
o now I feel dumb LMAO.  I think people kinda knew what I meant though haha.
Thanks for this tidbit.  I‚Äôm guessing she will have some synergy with Vision?
Brosplit in 2018?!?! That is about as old skool as it gets. Up the frequency man, hit each bodypart 2-3x each week!
Buy lots of assorted nuts, dried fruits, apples, bananas, 2-3 jars of peanut butter, 3 loafs of bread and stick 2 in the freezer, a few boxes of cereal and cartons of soy or rice milk. Foods like these are good for noshing or snacking before and after main meals. Save the special ingredients for breakfast, lunch and dinner meals. Make him pay for half. Getting mad at someone for eating to much is not good.

Their tiny hands on the chest had the same structure as their main legs. Just the bendable end used for digging or holding something.
The plot was incredibly predictable. The two of them walked onto the screen and gave their spiels. I immediately called what was going to happen from there. The thing is there was no attempt at a misdirect or anything.
Thanks for the insight, much appreciated 
FH and I make basically the same amount and we contribute to our household expenses equitably, so whatever it costs for mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc. - we put all that necessary money + just a little extra into a joint account each month. We contribute to the account based on % of income we bring to the table... but for his 'income' calculation, we do it net of any child support stuff he has going on. Our split ends up being 60/40 instead of 50/50.   I guess I end up paying "more" ... but the things I'm feeding in the 60/40 scenario are just what it takes for us to have our life the way we want it. I suppose we could do 50/50 contributions and then he just has less money for savings/retirement contributions, but to me that doesn't exactly help us both achieve our financial goals. We are very fortunate, and I would rather us both feel successful in what we are doing and affording than put him in a situation where he's paycheck-to-paycheck and I'm rolling in cash (slight exaggeration there). 
The little island I landed on measures in at ~1032ft in length at the longest point end to end. That's only 32ft longer than the minimum rated landing distance of the P51 (according to what I found, anyway), and puts you within less than a wingspan of falling off. Took me a few tries to get down on this one.

But I have contractual and professional duties to the patient - is it truly a gratuitous bailment? 
Ah, thank you.  Those details will help.  As far as styling, could you tell me what the style of the first suit is in my imgur album?  Or maybe the one worm by Joseph Gordon Levitt?
Wow u cured me 
Well, the 11 straight games is the fault of Stanford and USC who play ND the last week of the season on alternate years, meaning someone else in the Pac12 has to be on bye that week.
Got a Gurley jersey at the end of the year, was already psyched, but just a *little* extra excited that he's gonna be an longtime Ram.  Crossing my fingers, then hopefully pickin' up a jersey for Donald next

Do you think another reason they were left unpainted is to show off their sculpting skills? A painted surface could hide imperfections

It makes me think that those decks aren't shit, and T2 and T3 are closer to good than we give them credit for.
I can see why she's ur fiance 
I can't read Chinese and the English wiki's don't have that information.
Well they can be charming or initially convincing but they unravel when challenged and they become less stable as they age especially . Being young, interesting , successful, important or good looking gives them enough to function  but as soon as that goes away through age or similar  , they are relying on a healthy esteem which they don't have. Untreated it only gets worse and worse.
Jeez, for that price you're getting into Grimsmo territory.
Yeah tell me about it...
1- it's been awhile since I played through 4 (over ten years) but I'm amazed I don't remember Verdugo. That easily looks like the best mutation in that game from what I recall. Kinda makes me want to replay it just to take notice of it.  2- That is one bad ass quote. That is some amazing charector writing from a game of that period. Damn where was that writer for some of the later elder scrolls.   3- Amazed that English is your third language and equally disappointed in myself, lol. If only I could learn to speak just one language properly.
i guess he's just leaving out the part about forcing his sick, suicidal wife to get drunk and fuck 6 black guys against her will while he watches and films it?    just leaving that out, i guess?

Damm i think i would hate the warriors in this case since my hometown is in the same division when will us Seals catch a break
Because Rockstar hates us.  No but seriously it would be too easy I think, even if it had endless NCP's you're still basically guaranteed ~$500k. 
Same can be applied to the Waltons and Kochs though, and everyone else on the list.
I mean most of it is facetious. I don‚Äôt think he actually hates UCF as much as he pretends to, but he has a legitimate reason to be upset about his rank. He shouldn‚Äôt be below Westballz, period

We just need to up the challenges then! Make it so they dont survive long enough to receive treatment lol

Assuming its the same for Canada, you got that .5 points because you clocked out too early. 9 minutes or less is what doesn't give you a point. Also, 9 minutes or less is how late you can be clocking in before getting a point.   Example: if your shift ends at 6:00PM, you can clock out any time between 5:51 and 6:00. If your shift starts at 7:00AM, you can clock in any time between 7:00 and 7:09. 
Pretty sure treasure is bugged. Tons of complaints are being tossed around reddit since it was released
In each monsters statblock there is a description, right under the name, that gives their size and monster type. For instance, a goblin is listed as a Small humanoid.

Yup out of the box. Texture are smooth for both, but the hyperx is more smoother. I have both on the same desk lol. I have an L desk and the hyperx is used for gaming and the other for work. I used to game with the Qck, but I play with such low sensitivity and dpi (.71 in game in csgo, 250 dpi) so I needed faster pad and switched to hyperx. The qck has a stickier feeling with the same mouse setting. It's stickier so it has more control for fps gaming.

Indeed.  All jobs and places you have lived in a time frame.  They don't always tell you up front.  Some of us have moved a lot and require notes to provide this information. Common for USPS, Fedex, UPS.  Deeper if you must obtain general customs clearance.

Lets be real, objectives are all bullshit except for very specialized jobs.  As an applicant, if a company asks me to produce a cover letter or anything else aside from my education, credentials, and work experience  then I'm not interested in the job.  I've never seen in my 22 years of employment objectives or cover letters come up in the real world work place.   There is also no way I'm going to believe recruiters actually read every single cover letter or objective list.  It's would be a colossal waste of company time.  Especially since %90 of that crap is made up/graveling to stroke a company's ego.  Protip most people want the job to pay bills, second to that is career passion.  Just hire the most qualified and maybe then we would stop having so many idiots in jobs they clearly aren't qualified for.

Well this fo has absolutely killed it on recent trades outside of chapman and cueto. And i dont really fault them for cueto, they got at least one big prospect and 2 more that were showing promise. They havent panned out yet, but thats the nature of trades.   The biggest criticism would be trades they didnt make like cozart last year and Harvey and gennet this year. Im withoulding judegement on the lack of Gennet trade since we dont know what they were offered. And harvey could still get traded if a conteneder wants him down the stretch. 
Jaina? That's a grindy attrition deck. And what's wrong with control decks having win conditions? Every MtG control deck runs some kind of bomb finishers. Not every control deck has to be armoring up while the opponent fatigues to death.

Wouldn't tsunderes have a really long bond time early on?  and then like an instant 6-10 bond.
Wait, so that H610 Pro V2 is available now?  The link you supplied says it's $55 + $15 (total $70) for me.  Here in the UK that equates to about ¬£53, which is actually cheaper than some of the ones I listed above.  I might as well get that, right?  But I'll have to buy it quick because I don't think the sale will last much longer. I'm thinking even if I don't "need" tilt, I might as well get it if I can for the price it is currently at.
I think it definitely made more sense on paper from a business standpoint to trade deGrom, Matz and Wheeler.  Probably even Thor too and go for the full rebuild.  But I'm glad they didn't and I'm also glad they didn't just trade a couple of them.  Those guys have been together for so long now breaking them up would suck.  Yea the Mets are a joke, the Wilpons suck, the roster is perennially injured, but you don't hear a bunch of shit about our clubhouse falling apart.  Shoulda tried to get something for Bautista and Mesoraco, but it wouldn't have been much anyway.  At least I still have deGrom and Syndergaard starts to look forward to.
"I pay f2p for games I actually enjoy"  &gt;refuses to spend money on warframe  Okay so then you don't enjoy it.  Also, if you find issue with the fundamental income premise of the game and feel it pressures you unfairly then stop playing.

These people are fucking retarded.  Of course Einstein thought socialism was great.  He was living in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, when socialism was still just a nice theory of how to move away from an overbearing Prussian monarchy.  He died in the mid 50's, before Stalin and Beria and Mao and Pol Pot and Kim and Ho Chi Minh and Castro killed 100 million people proving that humans can't make it work without being forced to do so by men with guns.
Any word on how long the beta will last? Weekend I assume?
I'm saying they're are concealing "weapons" that go against their policy but aren't really going to do anything. They aren't trying to smuggle guns and swords and bombs, but smaller items. The point was to be hard to detect to expose loopholes and blind spots.   I'm no authority on this matter. But do you think the TSA and the DHS would release this information if there were lapses in security? They redact all kinds of pointless stuff citing "national security." Why wouldn't they keep these tests internal and secret as to not alert potential bad guys of loop holes???
Yes summited. Start early (3am from the lake) and wear a helmet! Saw probably 2 dozen people this weekend on the peak without helmets. 3 huge rockfall events happened on the peak while I was on it, keep your head on a swivel.
Historians don't really categorize whether things are in living memory or not. I'd say people generally say "within living memory" when they happened while old but not crazy old people were alive. 
"No, I got here just the other day."
&gt; Is it not the equivalent of an ad-hominem attack?  No, you fucking retard.  &gt; chose to simply attack the source itself.  Which is completely legitimate.  Ad hominem is when you try to discredit someone by attacking them personally *on unrelated grounds*.  I can call you an idiot because your ideas and sources are bad.  It's only ad hominem if I base my argument against your ideas *on personal attacks against you*.  There's nothing wrong with criticizing a source for being low quality and biased.

My parents were always on me about not "getting off my ass and looking" when I was younger. Mom, applications are done online now..  They also always pressed me to call them a week after I sent in the application and to continue calling every few days. No, that's annoying.

I'm not actively trying to lose weight, no, and as I've gotten a couple of comments like this, I'll address it: I do have a medical condition, and gaining weight is much harder for me than for most people so I run rather skinny, but I'm regularly monitored by a doctor and everything is more or less fine. I'm actually quite insecure about being so thin, and that's part of why I've been posting here: to lift my spirits.

No. We were actually friends for about 20 years before. For her to do that kind of ended the friendship.  I would've been totally okay with her saying "nah I don't see you that way" when I asked her out. But for her to say yes and not show up... fuck that. Even as just a friend, I deserve better.

This thread is a shitshow. To me, it's unnecessary and overkill, just like an actual HH. There is no need to give that to everyone in mod rotations over the next month. There is nothing really to gain from it from GGG's perspective.   These leagues alone aren't worth it for me to play because it skews how I want the content to be and it's too damn close to the next league to want to do the whole Trial bullshit, map progression and gear acquisition twice.

He knew she would enforce sanctions and if there was no response she might introduce new ones. I don‚Äôt think she viewed Putin/Russia as an friend/ally to the US.

The former.  Getting caught while trying to switch between high/low block is most likely because you're not doing it fast enough. Even if it feels like you are, you might be a few frames too slow. Especially online, where you have to account for frame delay. It can also happen if you're trying to go from crouching to standing and accidentally hit up-back.  Getting caught coming down from the air usually happens because the defending player is already holding down-back, but the attacking player is still airborne. So the defender hits the ground, immediately crouch blocks, and gets clipped by the overhead before the attacker lands. Or they're holding up-back and getting hit during pre-jump frames.

1.  You compare the idea that Tesla is overvalued to [the earth being flat](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8y19r7/former_tesla_employee_blasted_by_elon_musk_takes/e27lg6v/), so your definition of "fudster" is incredibly questionable to say the least.  2.  For all the complaining you do about shorts selling their position, I have yet to see a single complaint about all the longs selling their position.  It's not about anyone selling their position, you just don't want to hear anything that goes against your narrative.  This isn't a safe space for you to just hear whatever opinion you want to hear.
Use an Animation Blueprint to drive the logic of which animations to play and handle blending. Try searching the documentation or YouTube for examples of how to set one up. You'll also need to make sure the character knows to use the animation BP after you make it.
Malazon has a Deck that is pretty important, involving powerful figures and gods.
But the thing is, if a whale is gonna whale for a specific character. Then they're gonna spend money on said character regardless if it's a limited time gacha. They'll just keep throwing money at the current banner until they get what they want. On top of that, if they only wanted one specific character, Then they'd just spend on their individual.   I mean I understand the logic. But the movie characters not being in the premium pool doesn't really change if someone is gonna whale. It just means those characters will be featured in fillers a bit more often.

This guy in primary school had a big hatred for me because he says I was the reason he missed being there when his baby sister was born  The reason was because he decided to come to my birthday party and his baby sister just so happened to be born on that very same day and he bullied me for years over this.  If anything I at least admire the love and care he had for her but this was a bit much

I never said the US was the greatest country in the world, I don't even know how you could measure such a thing, every country has issues, and I'm sure you don't like the issues Austria has just as much as I dislike the ones in the US. I just don't see how shitting on the people that live here, when most of us don't like what we're going through either, is going to do any good.

Chain immigration takes decades.  Immigrants use less benefits than natural born citizens.  The immigration system is broken because we don't make it easier to get in. There is demand for workers, the workers have a hard time getting in, the workers break the rules. It's really capitalism's fault, which is why unnatural immigration law is profoundly anti-capitalist. 
I chose the Colts because they are no longer in the AFC East. Makes an easy touchstone on how crazy this is.
Probably because you're not socializing and establishing or joining a fireteam and instead relying on chance to link up with someone who is actually going to be good, even though the people who are good are probably not wanting to chance getting linked up with AFK or shit players so they either establish or join a fireteam with people who are likeminded....

If you're like most people your fighter is your primary exploration ship. You warp between systems in it, and you get jumped while traveling in it between systems and planets . You have to be able to survive anything in this ship. It should be a killing machine with Max weapons high defense and maneuverability.  With max general sots your fighter should still have adequate storage.. call your freighter in if you have to transfer any overflow. Your freighter should be following you like a dog anyway.  Even if you are on planet you can call it directly overhead.  Your exotic should be pure beast. Don't even waste space on the hyperdrive tech. It shouldn't even leave the freighter unless you expect trouble. Use it for capital ship battles and in dangerous areas prone to pirate activity. Save before leaving the freighter in this thing.

I've voted in every election since 2000, and have only voted for a Republican once: Bob McDonell for governor of Virginia, primarily because he repeatedly promised to allow private liquor stores. I've voted for one Democrat, also: Jim Webb for Senate in 2006. In all other races, I've voted for the Libertarian Party candidate (usually for statewide and Federal offices) or for independent candidates (usually in local races).

How to deal with jayce ? I feel like I can't do anything. If I try to make an aggressive move, he ends up destroying me in one combo (-30% hp left on me). On the other hand, if I dont make any moves, he just pokes me down till I need to recall. What materies should I run ? Is it possible to use ignite to kill him, or is tp a lot more safer ?  I've never actually won vs a jayce, but I recently hit D3 and now the match up is harder than ever, he destroys me.

Both of you are kinda morons.  Bill signed into law the expansion of the executive powers to control immigration.  Bush started the whole tough on immigration trend.  Obama kept it up but also made concessions.  Trump went full balls to the wall ‚Äútough‚Äù on immigration.  There is a huge difference between how these past presidents have handled immigration when compared to trump.

I think I can remember that 8KX was planned as a limited edition for KS backers only. I also think that even 1180Ti (that is realistically around 6 - 8 months ahead) won't be sufficient for 8KX. Although current 1080Ti is barely good for 8K, 1180 is 25% better and 1180Ti will be hopefully 40 - 45% better than 1080Ti, you need something like twice the power of 1080Ti for 8KX.  IMHO, the 30 - 40% improvements the latest update is talking about may be something to do with the lower render requirements. Maybe there is no significant visual gain between rendering 4K comparing to 2560x1440 when you downscale/upscale it.

Assuming any rate of return means they're not doing what I suggested. The fact that it's underfunded means they're really not doing what I suggested. Letting politicians decide what the rate of return will be, and letting them spend any extra is beyond stupid.   (I never understand teacher unions, and this is one reason why. Teacher unions don't like the people who always vote for no tax increases, but this issue could bring them together. When politicians voted for this stupidity, why didn't the unions go to those people with their concerns? Seems like that was a huge missed opportunity).

Always be willing to learn. Never be afraid to admit you don't know something. Everybody knows something you don't know yet.

We're all there to work together. If you need to ask or tell a doctor something, do it. They're just people and most of them are friendly and professional at least.

Generally speaking, I'm not happy to put basically any of those cards in my deck. The first dagger spray is always good, and I'll usually take the first flying knee or sucker punch so I can fight act 1 elites. After act 1, I don't think any of those are cards you want in your deck outside of weird corner cases.   Blade dance is trash damage-wise, as are all of the common silent attacks. That's not how silent wins games, at least not on A15. And if you're talking non-ascension, you can win just by playing well and it doesn't really matter what you draft.

Yeah with regard to meat, it's so controversial to have opinions on that and everyone is different.  I eat a primarily plant based diet with a lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, but I definitely notice feeling stronger when my diet has a little bit of meat in it, especially fish and red meat 1-2x a week (to prioritize heme iron absorption).  I don't eat a ton of dairy beyond hard cheese and butter due to lactose intolerance. I go whole days without animal products and definitely keep the portions small with meat (1 small steak is 2 meals for me), but I tend to recover better with a little bit of omnivory.  I'm also a 112 lb woman, so obviously my nutritional needs are going to be different from yours.  With regard to the blood work, just any time something is off, it's not a bad idea, you know?  If there's anything weird going on with your body autoimmune wise or nutrient absorption wise, physically stressing it with marathon training is only going to exacerbate things.

Sounds like a defrost issue. How long was it running when you took that picture? From the picture you posted there‚Äôs a full frost pattern shown so you don‚Äôt need to worry about anything with the sealed system. An issue with the operating thermostat would have symptoms like staying on too long, freezing food/shutting off completely for long periods of time. To test that your defrost circuit operates correctly make sure it‚Äôs been running at least several hours. Take a flat head screw driver and on the bottom of the temperature control knob area there‚Äôs a hole where the defrost timer can be turned. You‚Äôll know it when you see it. Turn it until you hear a click and when the fan and compressor turns off it is now in defrost. After about 5-15 mins open the freezer for awhile and listen for hissing noises. If you hear the freezer section hissing we know that the defrost circuit is good and the defrost timer that controls it is bad. If you don‚Äôt hear the freezer section hissing then most likely the defrost bimetal is bad, or possibly the heater.

Mascara can grow bacteria that it picks up from your eye over time. Styes are caused by an infection in the eyelash follicle and surrounding glands. Why it's recommended to throw away mascara after 3 months.

This is a really poor talking point to be honest. Regardless of how much you are taxed, unless 100%, you are still better off fiscally having worked more rather than less. The supposed 'disincentive' is just that a work life balance is given more of a value at higher income amounts.

I don‚Äôt ever weigh it out, but definitely keep track based on the size of my vaporizer. I know it has a ~.1g chamber, so can estimate about how much I‚Äôm vaping. To me, the particular strain I use and the temperature I vape at have the biggest effect on my experiences, so I keep track of those very closely (in a journal). I‚Äôd be interested to hear how your smoking experiences changed if you monitored it by weight more closely though!

Well if you were any good, you'd know that turning in coins involves turning in coins.  Any team with a brain will contest.  Then again, the last game I remember playing that map, I had 100 coins on me until I intentionally died in the enemy base (as we were destroying their core).  100 coins is the limit - you can't pick up any more.

You‚Äôre getting downvotes because you‚Äôre admitting to driving in a dangerous way and acting like it‚Äôs no big deal. Deaf and Hearing impaired drivers are going to be more sensitive to emergency vehicle lights because lights are how a lot of things are communicated to them such as the doorbell, phone, fire alarm, baby monitor, etc. It may not have caused you to wreck yet but it is still dangerous and could cause you to miss important information on the road.

Well, this is "in association with Marvel", which really just means they're using the name to promote the movie. It's a Sony movie not a Marvel one, which bodes badly for the quality. Say what you want about Marvel, they're the only ones doing superheroes with any sort of consistency.

This may be true for transfers between accounts at Ally (actually, those should be 'instant', so I don't know what you're referring to that's 24 hours. Cite reference please?) but it is not true for transfers to other banks. In those cases it's still three days since they're sending it through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). Any bank using the ACH will take at least 2-3 business days for the transfer.

&gt; Using "culture" as an excuse to be racist doesn't mask the fact that you are, in fact, racist.  Culture is the operating system we all live by.  That‚Äôs why in the past - some cultures (such as Vikings) raped and pillaged, while others did not approve of those actions during the same time period.  It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù, it has a real effect on the individuals that are raised in it.

This reminds me of pythons in FLorida. In the 80s and 90s, a lot of rich Floridians bought Pythons. When they realized they make boring pets, they dumped them all off in the Everglades. Now of course the ecosystem is messed up and pythons are eating all the mammals there.

The conference's main sponsors are the local universities and government (a government's funding initiative).

excellent, that looks like it.  How can they say it was simply for warding off evil tartars on horses when Russia was [continuisly expanding ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russische_Verhaulinie#/media/File:Russie_1300_1796.png)eastwards and putting up new "defense lines" all the time?  I mean personally I would be pretty upset if someone steals my land and than cuts it off with a wall.  Something doesn't add up. Completely possible that Tartary was simply surrounded and put under pressure and their defense was then put into history books as aggression. Everyone just hated the Tartars it seems, and their world got smaller and smaller over time.  The propaganda against them is completely engrained into our culture with the Gog &amp; Magog myth, Alexander putting them behind a big wall, etc. Looks like the Tartars are the black sheep that somehow didn't fit in with the rest of humanity.
I love so much about this. The art style is similar to an illustration in a storybook which gives the impression of a brilliant fantasy world filled with tiny dragons.

As much as I hate most terribly balanced hunter fights, Djura is the one time I'm willing to let the game off the hook. After all, he is literally a far more experienced and powerful version of yourself. It's still early in your journey, so it makes sense that someone that's basically a post-game dream hunter himself would just outclass you. And I think it must have been a cool realization for people who put the pieces together with Djura and realized that hey, THAT'S why he's so monstrously strong.
I love the crowd energy over there too

 This is the scary truth.  People think that a civil war would be militia's taking to the streets to confront the government or the opposing faction.  The reality is it will look more like Oklahoma City, Ruby Ridge, the recent Austin bomber, etc, making these idiots much more similar to jihadists than "freedom fighters".  And keep in mind they DOJ backed off monitoring the far right extremists despite a rise in rhetoric and recruitment.

World at War. I really love the story that they have for it.
&gt;But what if it is shown that allowing people to say that Americans are lesser people increases the amount of violent anti-american attacks? Would you still allow it?  As long as these individuals are not directly advocating direct violence themselves, yes.  The guilt lies with people who turn their hate to violence.  Someone who hears extreme ideas and turns them into evil acts is responsible for that alone.  To say otherwise is to deny the agency and responsibility each of us has for our own actions.  &gt;Oh you're one of those people. Someone who doubts the effectivity of all modern western societies, just because we are not all of the same colour and do not all have the same traditions.  Quite the opposite.  The paradox you present doubts it, because it assumes some external force (suppression of freedoms) is needed to hold different people together.  I believe that people, when in a society that promotes liberty and prosperity, will naturally move away from hate and towards cooperation even without hate speech laws.It takes time, there will be setbacks, as the wounds of history are deep, but largely we march ever forward if you look at the arc of history.  I'm happy to hear your friend feels at home, and hope everyone does, but when it comes to welcoming people of all backgrounds to feeling like part of society, we do relatively well overall: [http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2015/sd-agenda2030/RobertoFoaPaper.pdf](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2015/sd-agenda2030/RobertoFoaPaper.pdf)

Sagari.  Silk threads braided and toughened with glue (silk for high level rikishi, soft cotton for lower ranks.)  It marks where not to grab at the start of the match, but they often get pulled off the main belt during the grapple.

Damm this is how I feel. I see people who travel so much (or so they claim) and I've never been outside North American. Born and raised in New York City.

I'd love to explore another city with a girlfriend sometime though.

Unless there's something in the contract, which you and they signed, stipulating the previous owner can request their car back, tough luck on them.   That reason they gave you is shit and can't be enforced.  Have they email you (in writing) that is the reason so if they decide to try to use other tactics later (financing/car inspection/whatever) you have that as the documented first reason which any court would throw out.

I got Onion Sage USB and Edward's USB (who can also use AcM), so I can support it externally, but Matoya and Shantotto don't need it, which is nicer for them.  EDIT: And with the new VIII banner in JP, you now have a choice with Edea USBs: USB1 for Ability Double vs USB2 for Ice Quick Cast. At least she got a W-Cast Ice LMR too.
Sorry, that's tough.  Have you visited the financial aid office and ask them what they suggest?  Also, if you don't need a car, I would suggest getting rid of it. If you need a way to commute, consider getting a bicycle.  Lastly, are you working? If not, ask if you qualify for a work study program. If not, try to pick up a part time job on or around university campus. I was lucky enough to have a part time job in second year and it covered the shortfall between financial aid and what I actually needed to pay for loans.  The last resort is private student loans, but those tend to have horrible terms and extremely high interest rates. Kind of like payday loans. I would only use them as a last resort.
&gt; In my experience, leadership will say they want "a single pane of glass" for encryption across all platforms. It's stupid af and makes it harder for us to support Macs, because now we have to wait for our encryption client to get updated for each new version of macOS.  +elevnty million upvotes!  So, we had the same debacle at my Org.  They wanted to centralize FDE keys. My team, which does all the Mac IT and related services for all Macs at my Org met with the people that wanted the single pane of glass. I explained to them that yes, I can setup a redirect profile to ship the FV2 to any service, but they did not want to host anything, they wanted to just direct DB connector to my services and grab it.  I explained, it doesn't work that way, that you will need to build an API or an App I can ship data to. From there how you consume it and how you put it into your systems is 100% up to you.  Then I mentioned that their service must be publicly exposed, as we have Mac Clients off campus and off network all the time, and all of our services are in The Cloud.  So, they will need to expose an API or an appliance to the Internet to escrow the keys.  They were like we cannot do that.  Then I said they would be solely responsible for all FDE keys, data, and integrity of said keys and rotation of said keys because once it leaves our systems we have zero control over any of it.  At the end of my meeting with the team responsible for the single pane of glass of FDE keys, they basically said they were not interested in doing any of that because it was too much work.  So, that was the one and only meeting I ever had about shipping the FV2 keys to a centralized system for the single pane of glass.
Dude seriously! August is now my favorite month
I agree we should care.  But the Left and democrats are voting to rob the individuals, neighbors, next door to them so the uncaring govt can 'care' for people. The democrats and Left are not voting that they themselves actually get their hands dirty. It's not like they are voting to use  their own time and money. They are voting to use other peoples time and money that the govt robbed off of their neighbors for them.  Like I said, neo-Democrats and the people on the Left really don't desire to be personally responsible like the Right teaches. They dont want to be responsible for their own HC. They dont want to be responsible for paying for their own college education.

That sounds exactly like the Crucible BEFORE this SBMM glitch....  "I play with two freinds, neither of whom are great". Gee, well I'm not so great either, but the difference between us is I ONLY ever played Solo, and I have always been getting "curb-stomped" becuase being solo was a death sentence.   I dreaded playing Crucible before this becuase it was only the Stacked Teams that ever had fun, so I just stopped.  But now, im finally playing Crucible for fun again, and not just dreading through it for the Milestone, and it's about damn time. So, I guess it's going to suck for someone either way. At least now, a Solo player can finally have some fun. And that sounds like an overall better Crucible to me
Wow. This is a much better photo than the one that the business association has commemorating the event.  I'm not home to check but I believe, for those curious, the fire came from a forge a part of the saddlery and destroyed most of this side of Queen Street. Townsfolk attempted to put out the fire with buckets from the estuary awaiting response from Papakura.  https://digitalnz.org/records/35065315 - more accounts of the extent of the damage.   1926 faced another great fire on the other side of Queen Street between the Kentish Hotel and Bowen Street, destroying yet more of the town

 Whether God chooses it or not is an age old question I believe. It comes with the question of what's God's "control" ,for lack of a better word, his omnipotence or his perfect nature. I think it works harmoniously so that God chooses to carry out the punishment because that's what is just, and it must happen because it's a part of God's perfect nature.
Done. Thanks.
Seriously though like the other guy said. Play with the trigger screws(theres 3) and set it to your liking. Aside of that, this gun is seriously the perfect marker. The only thing it doesn't have is an OLED screen. But you'll set your parameters once and never play with that again anyway.  I'd say learn how to change firing modes(its simple, the manual can be a little tricky to understand, but there's a good many videos online that show step by step) just so you can swap from ramping to semi. Then chrono it and adjust the velocity of needed. Mine was shooting at 240 out of box.   Welcome to the etha2 master race. You'll love this gun.  Edit: after owning this gun, I purchased an ETEK5 OLED on a FB B/S/T group for 350.   I still use my etha2 more than the etek.

"civil rights" is meant to mean not being discriminated against based on your sexuality by the government.  You cannot stop private citizens from discriminating against you without seriously curtailing the freedom of everyone.  Why aren't you capable of discussing this in good faith? I think I've made myself clear that I wouldn't discriminate against you and I'd even boycott those who did.  You say I'm preaching oppression because I think business owners should have the freedom of association. That is ridiculous. If you can't see the difference between freedom and oppression that is on you. But saying I'm preaching oppression is at best in bad faith if not malicious and idiotic.

You could have two of the three things about healthcare:  -Universiality -Quality -Affordability  It's very easy to grandstand and say we need to tax the wealthy, like we already are by the way.

My reasoning is that I can't figure out what makes the Doctor so very British in the first place.  * It's not race, so we can get that off the table right away; the whole idea that the Doctor must look like someone who might have been waiting on the shore when the Normans came calling doesn't hold up. I'd love to see Adrian Lester or Sacha Dhawan play the Doctor.  * It's not the accent, plainly; we've had a couple of Scots, a Northerner (two, soon), lots of Queen's English... there's been a lot of variety there, even if they've all been from the UK. I can't see that there's anything radically different about choosing an American accent over a British one, especially given the variety of accents we already have here. It's not as though the Doctor always has to fit into a particular UK regional stereotype. Lots of planets have a North. Lots of planets probably have a America (or equivalent) too.  * Is it a sort of *quintessential Britishness*? Well, what does that even mean? The role would still be written largely by British writers; the humour and sentiment would still be largely British, rather than having an American flavour to it. Would it even be noticeable if an American actor did a flawless British accent (the same way Hugh Laurie did in reverse for *House*)? I'd argue that that wouldn't matter -- but in that case, we just go back to the accent point from above. To say that there's a *quintessential Britishness* implies that there *is* something that can be caricatured, and that it and only it is right for this one particular character -- a sentiment that has to pervade the character. Well, we've had twelve different versions of this one guy and they've all been super different to each other. I find it difficult to agree with the idea that the one thing that links every iteration is an unknowable British vibe, so I think this one's out too.  * Is it an out-of-universe issue? That one seems the most compelling. The idea of the show being British through and through -- like *Harry Potter*, where Rowling insisted on a British cast -- might be a big part of its appeal. In that case, though, could we have an American companion? Would that somehow break the illusion of it being a show that *we* made? I don't think so. The leap to an American Doctor doesn't seem all that far after that.  Can I think of any Americans offhand that I'd like to play the Doctor? No, not really -- but that doesn't really mean much; I'm not a casting director, and this is just a hypothetical. I'm not saying I think this is something that *should* happen. But could it?  Well, I can't see why not.
It's obviously the button with the red dot.
I would like to also add:  Mix set is much stronger than nohime set. But it is harder to use (not as consistant) as you have to know when the effect of schrod top will activate for maximum damage.  Therefore: If the playstyle revolves around a lot of QTE switching from then go for mixed set.  If playstyle is mainly using memento to kill enemies and not much of switching QTE then use full nohime set. Nohime set works much better when using memento solo mainly.  2

you can do everything digitally.  i would imagine many people still like to do sketches on physical paper, but many artists just draw digitally using some tablet system (see https://youtu.be/ahpUb_RzGJA).  there's no reason to draw something on paper and then digitize it. just draw it digitally.

I think it's important to note that neither you nor she knew that Sylvanas was going to burn down Teldrassil at the time she hands her hippogryph off to you.

She even tells you before you set off to 'make sure her people are treated well under the horde's occupation.'  It just so happened Sylvanas changed her mind at the drop of a hat.

Same. I'm a supporter of our health care and one of the things that I like is that there is a bit more of a focus on preventative education and health care than in the US, but then it does ultimately rely on individuals trying to minimize their own risk.  Which a lot of people will do because there's an obvious personal benefit to themselves, but a lot of others just...won't.

You're building quite a strawman there.  Nobody is suggesting people should "have to shit all over the floor because they don't have a toilet."  Nobody is saying there should be no "health regulations."  What I "propose" is a landlord and their tenet coming to an agreement on their own about a property to be rented.  If the landlord offers 10,000,000 stations of movies and a 2,000" television and the tenet agrees then that is what needs to happen.  If the landlord tells the tenet the property doesn't include running water and the tenet accepts it, then that's what they get.  Allow the market to do its job and if someone wants to rent a property with no toilet then great, if not, the landlord will need to install one in order to win someone's business.  &gt;So lets just throw the last 137 years of progress out the window!  Literally nobody has said this.  I'm sorry that the point has eluded you, I tried to make it as simple as possible but apparently I did not aim low enough.

Wow, nice. I always found biology intimidating. I'm in physics, planetary science.  Well my classmate can't help but see me as a rival and plays that as a zero-sum game, where winning = beating others. Her jokes about stealing love and attention from our adviser sounded less and less like jokes. You know what it does to the hypersensitivity of a BPD. She went from admiring me to talking down to me. And we dated. When I stood up to her continuous low-key abuse (not in the most adult way... first a few days of silent treatment before I had cooled off enough to have a direct conversation), she cut me off. She's completely ignoring me now. My attempt to talk with her was rewarded by niceties like "It doesn't matter since you're leaving".  I was so hurt, my BPD symptoms became strong enough for me to remember this list I had heard a few years ago, so I went to my therapist with that idea and was diagnosed.  I am friends with plenty of people I work around, friends work fine, maybe it's a bit more delicate if you directly work with them. I don't know how you'd tolerate a workplace where you're not friend with anyone! Dating proved to be a mistake, but this girl clearly got her own issues. And it's not like I can afford to be picky, women seem to sniff the BPD and run away.

I'm skeptical that any physics professor who looks at it closely would ever believe it.  The main thing that first caused the 9/11 conspiracies is how the buildings collapsed with debris shooting out of it like a bomb. Some people said it was like a bunch of bombs going off in one story after another.  The truth is once the support beams got too weak to hold up the rest of the building it collapsed on itself. The debris shot out of it like a bomb because the roof collapsed. All the air inside the collapsing floors had nowhere to go but through the smashed walls, and the air took a bunch of debris with it (that followed for the same reason).

Goldwater played fast and loose with nuclear weapons, supported escalation of military conflict with Russia, and made dismantling America‚Äôs social safety net a core principal of his political life.   Every Republican ‚Äî from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush ‚Äî can look to Goldwater as an intellectual father of their governmental fecklessness. He wanted, actively, to dismantle the institutions that make the American government strong enough to handle the challenges we, as Democrats, ask it to.  And, on top of all that, his vehement opposition to the Civil Rights Act cannot be hand-waved away ‚Äî least of all from a political party that is, right now, attempting to position itself as the party of people of color in this country.   At best, Goldwater was a political coward who used the racist white vote to accrue power for his protolibertarian political philosophy. At worst, he was a monster.   Why are we spending time defending the father of the modern Republican Party?

Taxes and regulations aren't the reason for-profit companies don't solve the resource distribution problem.   The profit incentive IS the resource distribution problem. There is plenty of food, clothing, and shelter to go around, but companies are only interested in providing them to paying customers.   So, those who can afford food, clothing, and shelter have them in excess. So much so that most food food purchased in restaurants goes to waste,  and high end fashion lines burn unsold inventory rather than donate it.   Because there is NO incentive in a capitalist system to provide goods and services to those who can't pay i.e. those who need it most.

Well I don‚Äôt want to play devils advocate, but anything that stops the incessant dodge rolling strats is good in my book. It‚Äôs like the next big thing in ‚Äúhigh level‚Äù duelling.   Edit: not just kick-grab, it‚Äôs anything at all you roll away from. 
You gonna need alot of jamming.
She must have been abused. Who would ‚Äòmire that shit? 
Just finished some research on nitroethylene solvatochromic probes, from computer simulation to lab experiments. An overall success but that also means a hell of a lot more work from this stage to truly achieve any major results. Unfortunately my tenure with the programme has come to an end so someone else is gonna be doing the rest from here. Onto the next one I guess! 
The dog can‚Äôt distinguish if you‚Äôre scolding it or the elevator. You‚Äôre better off rewarding the dog, in baby steps, or approaching the elevator and then getting in it. 
I‚Äôm broke and can‚Äôt afford to do something that would be a huge positive life changer although I‚Äôve tried to make the money needed but couldn‚Äôt and tomorrow‚Äôs my deadline so I‚Äôve been very depressed and feel like I‚Äôve failed my kids. 
Yield means stop if others are already in the lane, not merge. 
I'd be down if there's an opening.  Might need more info because I'll be super busy mid-late Aug which is when most drafts seem to be
I dunno, I think it might be tainted with the knowledge that the next step is waiting to die. I don‚Äôt think that feeling will ever be replicated, I‚Äôve  jumped past many high pressure hurdles since but I never really got that feeling back. 
I see Lucio wasn't effected by the snap
Honestly, even 100hz is enough for racing games.
Keto is a great diet to be on **if** you're already healthy. I actually ended up super-ripped for a while, but that was combined with serious exercise. You can't just go on keto and expect ketosis to kick in and do all the work for you.
This guy loves starting arguments over nothing. I honestly think it does help him sleep at night.
r/quityourbullshit Why did I get downvoted smh
No Google Pay for me yet =(
Pretty sure there was an entire Avatar server back a few years ago. I don't know how good it was.  Though the Minecraft train has long departed.
He just said "how many of levels of ideology are you on?" without challenging my point. He never clarified what he meant, even.  It is a mode of production. Okay. Don't see how that would make it immoral.

"Eyes, lungs... Bank lease... So many slacks, so little time."  What-the-actual-fuck is he saying?

Perhaps. Or maybe, unlike Hannity‚Äôs viewers, the advertisers truly understand how feeble his numbers really are and will not do so. We shall see.

That's why I also mentioned cores.? How has no one noticed that.?
Anyone else notice the Avengers "A" logo is not a poster option?  IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS!
You're welcome
&gt;Imagine if we lived in a world where the worst thing anyone ever experienced was a stomach ache.   Wow, that would be such a great world. So much nicer than this one. I wonder why an all-powerful, all loving God didn't create that world? If He existed, that is.

This is ridiculous. As if the general public would pour into PBE 18xx games.
Good
Why do people continue to think they are doing you a favor by taking a free thing off your hands?   Like, I get that if someone's giving something away for free obviously they just want to get rid of it, but it's fucking free, just take it! This is why I hate people.
True, but I barely do it and get away with that pretty easily.  It's the whole tone, the way teachers are taught is ridiculously simplistic. They basically give you a checklist on how to make your method, material or approach "educational"/"interesting" but on a base level, few teachers know how to talk with kids, grasp at straws on how to motivate them or approach them. You get folders on "good rules to apply" and then teachers read off the new rules and later sighs in the teachers lounge how they won't work and those awful kids don't take them seriously already.   I feel like our educationsystem rarely takes it's students seriously. And I feel like highschool ends up defining you more instead of learning you how to define yourself. 
We do although we have a software development team in-house that would handle things like that
So you admit your post is a reposti! Deploy the downvotes!
Are you considering the amount of fatigue built up in the previous five events?

I'd download games to bring home and play on my PC haha
Plenty of pitchers have the ability to win a Cy Young but more than likely Archer‚Äôs best days are behind him.   That doesn‚Äôt mean his contract isn‚Äôt one of the best in baseball but he‚Äôs not an ace and it absolutely would shock me to see archer with a sub 3 ERA because that‚Äôs the ‚ÄúNats will finally win a playoff series‚Äù of pitchers.   Until it actually happens I‚Äôll go with what history has shown instead of what intuition feels like.  Archer wasn‚Äôt even one of the 5 best pitchers in the AL East and now he‚Äôs supposed to be a Cy Young winner? I‚Äôm not buying it, as much as this sub loves to hype up everyone at the trade deadline. 
I‚Äôve got posts in this sub from 7 years ago - some of my first posts were here, before I was even old enough to pay attention to politics.  So pick your toys up out of my yard, yo

I already am taking DSP. Was hoping to take digital communications too but couldn't. So I have to pick one of the 3 courses aside from DSP in my post. I was asking which of those 3 is best for this field. 
Just google for some shady Minecraft launchers (that have version 1.13 too), it's not that hard.
Ah this repost again...
You don't need to have your wisdom teeth out or your tailbone cut off either.

Not to the police.  Not to the Judge.  Not to the jury.  Not to the appellate court.  Not to the federal Court.  Not to the Supreme Court.  I'd keep going but Dassey ran out of Courts.
Ask if there is any work available for me to do. Or ask colleagues if they need help with anything.
I bet probably Saturday or Sunday.
