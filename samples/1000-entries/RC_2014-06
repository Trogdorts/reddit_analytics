If that family trend continues, they are going to have the most epic family reunions.
&gt; What are they honestly going to do with him?   Try him and attempt to put him in jail.  &gt;How do they expect people to use legal services with all the bullshit going on in the US with net neutrality and comcast etc.  Yes, I'm sure the Swedish authorities make all their arrests in full consideration of what it means in the United States.
Google knows all.
I think It should be for people on prp, or deal with prp tbh.
Druids are required to respect nature, but precisely what that *means* is not clearly defined and presumably left up to the individual druid somewhat.
&gt;TwoX recently had a spate of this where some woman dared state that she was happy. They did not like that.   Oh they totally flipped their fucking lids over it. But TwoX is going through a troublesome time at the moment. It has always been a Tumblr-esque sub here on Reddit, then it was defaulted and suddenly the whole site became aware of what a fucking joke the sub is.  Then their members flipped over it being a default, reg'd a load of alt accounts, sent themselves threats of violence/rape (the same shit feminists on Twitter have been shown to do), brigaded their own sub, posted shit/abuse on every thread, reported shit en mass etc.   Now the admins have come out and said "calm the fuck down please, we can see blatantly that most of the abuse TwoX is encountering currently is from its own members under alt accounts" and the precious snowflakes involved in this shit turn around and cry "misogyny!"  I mean it's similar to the following:  Person A: "B, you're a fucking psychopath, you should get some help!"  Person B: "I'm not a fucking psychopath, watch me prove it to you, you oppressor!"  Person B: *Behaves as mentally sound as GG Allin*
I don't actually understand whether it's satire or that peoples concepts of 'salt' and 'BM' are this broad. 
To the tune of Let it Go:  Brave glows bright in this shitpost tonight Not a good word to be seen It's a kingdom of 'just a joke, guys' And it looks like your the king The apology is howling like the shitty jokes inside You didn't keep it in, and you didn't try  don't want you in here, don't you see?  Are you a STEMer? You almost have to be  Rule X, you feel? This ain't your show?? Yet there you gooo; "Let it go, let it go! There's no discrimination anymore!!!! Let it go, let it goo!! Give it up, you harpy wh*re!! I don't care what you people say!!! Let your posts rage on, I'm telling my shitty jokes anyways".   It's funny how le STEMlords make big deals seem small. Mom's so-called politeness can't get to them at all!! It's time for their shit to show through; to be all edge and all poo. No right, all wrong, all shit beliefs; THEY'RE FREE;  They let it go!! Let it go!!! No 'fellow man' anymore. Let it go!! Let it goo!! Turn away from that 'good human' bore. They don't care what about the words they say. Their shit rages on  Their shitposts flurry through the site into the ground. Their bad opinions in TOO LONG text posts all around. And one thought in my mind, like an icy blast. These people are fucking real, their shit ain't in the past!!!  won't let it go! Let it go! Ill do this till I die! Won't let it goo! Let it goo! Oh, and RULE X BYEEEEE!!  Here I am, in this sub today. Let the tears flow on, the brave never bothered me anyway. 
You... Are a rare person. You're the only person I've ever been with who's ever really wanted **ME**. Not.... *pauses for a long time* just to make my brother jealous... Or a casual fuck to get over a friend who wouldn't admit their feelings... You're the only person to ever like me for me. I like you for you. I do want to be with you. *nods* ... So if you've got anything else you want to ask... Go ahead.
Soft lips! Ftw
I'm a little late to respond, but oh well!   My parents work for the airlines as well and I get the flight benefits until I'm 23 and it's great! You can find some great places to visit in New Orleans. Not quite off the beaten path, but a great experience nonetheless. There's museums, places to sightsee in the Quarter and along the riverfront. You can shop at the malls and at the boutiques in and around the French Market and Canal Street. Finding a place to listen to some local music isn't hard either! Good luck with traveling!
Flappers: just wash it, secure the bandaid with athletic or climbing tape, and climb on!  Question 2: Aaah slopers. Some tips are "try and pull down and through the hold", and "stay underneath it". To stay underneath holds, sometimes you need to bend your legs to make a frog-like stance. It's also worth trying to hold on to the slopiest holds on any hangboards you have in your gym. Just go for maximum hang time, if you can hold on for longer than 10 seconds it's too easy so try a slopier grip!
Uh... you should consider each song in its time of fame. It doesn't matter where grunge is NOW

I don't mind if someone expresses an opinion but they can be annoying if all they say is "x won the LP" as if you watched it you know and don't care and if you haven't watched it then you don't want to see it. Also its just the fact that some do it just to annoy others.

How dare him! that's very unamerican! 
Oh geeze. This kid sure is something special. 
Seems like they are making all the right moves now. They have so much confidence right now. I hope Scarra can keep that feeling tempered. I think it will be C9 first, Dig second, and CLG winning the third place match against LMQ. I can't put Dig first since C9 doesn't seem to lose in the playoffs. =)
What if Gordon Freeman was in Smash? Does anybody know if his voice actor is available?
i was really young and didn't understand how taboo talking about your mortgage was, and i told a woman i knew what our family was paying and she guilt tripped me so bad, i honestly didn't understand what i'd done wrong.
There's "kinda" something like this. The Looking Glass Knight summons two squires (I think max two) during the boss fight, one possibly being another player.  I've had three players vs. Me + LGK + NPC Squire  It's a different dynamic than what a 3 player vs. 3 player fight would look like, but it still is amazing.  NOTE: There is typically a little to a lot of lag if this happens.
Riv always slips in comments like that. I don't know how he manages to always do that on the fly. 
Subtle reference. I like it.
In my opinion, D2L should have definitely cancelled the bet due to the change in player during the match.   Now to argue that Empire had an advantage because Universe was the stand-in for one of his signature heroes is far fetched. First of all, the matched was played in EUW(http://www.datdota.com/match.php?q=692549864) and Universe plays from EG I think that's located in USW?(Correct me if I'm wrong) So, he had to play with 200-300 ping which is a huge disadvantage for Empire. 
Thanks for the list! it should be extremely helpful for anyone looking for these mats.  It is not extremely easy as there are people with extreme bad luck.   Farmed Augs with the Mat Farming community for 2-3 hrs straight. Found 3 mats on T4. T4 is supposed to have a 50% chance of a drop, not so for me. RNG is RNG, but at 50% + group bonus, I must have extremely bad luck. As for the the bounties spawning, ~8 straight times that the bounties did not spawn, either on A1 or A2. 
For me, Verizon signed a contract with NJ to have the whole state broadband capable by a certain year, and my .7/1.3 mb dsl counts in this contract, if I recall correctly.  If the definition changes then they'd have to get their rear in gear...   I hope.

I didn't mean to undersell her. To be honest I've only seen her in maybe 2 films, Chicago and Down with Love haha.
I'm a Packer fan and I think most UK NFL folk wouldn't change their first team (swapping teams just isn't something you do in any sport). But there are plenty of neutrals who would follow the team; plenty of people who start following them cause a franchise is launched in their city; and a lot of fans who they would suddenly become their second team.  Watching the London games is always a slightly strange experience because you have 80,000 people there who love the sport (despite what the article says) but relatively small contingents of the teams playing, so you don't get that really strong home and away team atmosphere swinging with offence and defence.  I think a London franchise would certainly do well initially. It would be a huge event even here for a London franchise in the sport and the attention would bring fans. The London games have always sold out quickly and I don't think that would necessarily change hugely with a jump from 3 to 8.  However I think a few years down the road if the team is struggling, the initial hype has died down, etc. Attendance may drop and I don't know if it comes back up.  I personally think there are a bunch of things that could be done to grow the game in this part of the world that aren't the drastic step of launching a franchise here. 
did anyone else get that taste in their mouth as they saw it?
This.

Even so, we can't be charged with something that the prosecutor won't provide evidence for, especially not in other countries. That's like full on revolution tier tyranny.   So the US could blackmail me about say, my crush on the girl at the supermarket or something but whatever, it's not like they can come after me for anything else. That's kind of the price I'm willing to pay for access to social media.   Maybe it's different because I'm not a huge privacy person (although I do understand that want and respect people who would like to exercise that right) but this doesn't massively bother me.

Like I can get to lvl 5 and have enough to finish devos and get beads and boots. Whereas the dt makes me stay in lane longer to get the gold and I wont be able to pick up other stuff. Considering I've never been behind in gold since starting this I feel like it's significant. Matter of fact ever since the shift has occurred in the meta I've always had a significant lead over my opponents. I believe it's because I outdamage them. Since adcs always get mana buff I dont need the dt for that which for me was always the only reason I got it. That early sustain which now with devos ill have no matter what.
Some people change their minds once more facts become available.  It's probably for the better.

No screw that, lets change every single game to satisfy this one guy that doesn't play multiplayer instead.
There is truth in that. Again, this is why I would want this particular question answered with total honesty. Most decent people are too polite to say something like that to their face, which may be why no one has ever said it. I have certainly thought about it already myself.

Nothing is off limits in a relationship and there is no privacy, which is why you maintain OPSEC. No one's fault - but your own - that *you* gave her the name of your ex. What did you expect?   Of course they are going to dig into your past. That's what women generally do. Women generally will go to the ends of the earth to prove they are right, especially when they are wrong, and they will break every rule in the book to do it. Yes I realize that allegedly Not All Women Are Like That^TM.  That said, what she did is called an ad hominem attack so she does not have to deal with the current issues of the argument. It's irrational and makes no sense, but there it is...  Question is, do you want a lifetime of this or do you want to move on to a more mature women you can start fresh with, next time *not* violating OPSEC, because she will bring it up every time she is feeling defeated in an argument in order to alter that argument to her favor in her batshit crazy mind. In my experience, it's not about fixing the problems with most women, but winning the argument.

AFAIK Psy got a couple millions for it. So not "insanely" rich. YG made 90% of the money, that's how big labels work, they take nearly everything. (I think it was around 8 millions for PSY all in all and 200+ millions for YG).  And Psy is not a one hit wonder, because he was known before (not worldwide obv but still), and he is keeping up so there's no reason he suddenly dissapears, his MVs will still hit 500 mill views (Gentleman is near 700 mill atm).
I know there is already a similar comment but getting some good beard balm or something similar and applying it to your beard right after a shower then brushing it through seems to do the trick for me, i have a friend who does the same thing and it tends to keep most of it straight!

Woah, I just looked up online that brain damage usually occurs after 4-6 minutes and death at 10! Maybe numbers are off and adrenaline slowed time down but my sister remembers looping around for a few minutes searching for me (and who knows how long I had been under at this point, but the first place she went was outside) and then it definitely took some time for the paramedics to show up; we're about 10 minutes from the local hospital.  If that did anything to my brain, I certainly lucked out to just end up being a girl with traditionally-labelled boy parts.

3rd in the 100m and 3rd in the 4x100m relay at MHSAA D2 State! (10.98 and 43.28 respectively)  Team got 3rd total... missed out on 2nd place (a cool trophy and also a runner up banner in the gym) by 2 points :/  Overall a fantastic day though. Feels amazing to be all-state 2 years in a row.   Edit: forgot to mention that I spoke to a member of the MSU track team. I'm going to MSU next year (unrelated to athletics) and he said there's a good chance I could get a spot on the team. Definitely something to consider.

No, would someone going "you don't really like nail art or else could could tell me this obscure ingredient in a random indie brand that makes it smell like an ape's behind!" an arsehole? Yes.   would an overwhelming community reaction towards that arseholeness put me off? Of course.   thankfully the nail art community is rather helpful, supportive and willing to educate, excited to bring in more interest.   people who have passion tend to be eager to share with just about anyone. Unfortunately some fandoms are downright possessive. 
Yeah I'm from the south and I'm in serious need of cuddles or just someone to talk to right now 
The Ho-Oh is in great shape for its age, not totally mint but no serious wear at all. I'm attached to it but if it's the only way I can get Charizard I'll consider it.

So you're doubting my stated position on gun control because I mocked someone's motivation for protesting? If all I did was mock them, assuming I was in favor of gun control might be a safe bet, but once I've stated I'm not its a rather ridiculous idea. What exactly would be my motivation in saying I'm on the fence when I'm not... Is it a long con to infiltrate and get in with all the moderates out there so I can listen to them waffle on issues? Maybe I read your comment history and saw you were on the fence and decided to say I was as well so i could trick you! You know, for thrills! I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really don't get the point of your comment.
OK, so in Path of Exile, rare items can roll up to 6 modifiers each of which will boost a given stat. You have probably seen a stat on an item called "Spell Damage" (just for an example). You may have also noticed that sometimes you get only 10% spell damage, and other times it can roll as high as 74%. The difference between these rolls are called Tiers (abbreviated T1, T2, T3, etc).  The above linked dagger has 5 T1 rolls, 2 of which are Prefixes, 3 of which are suffixes.    * Tyrannical (% physical damage, range 150 to 169) * Flaring (+ flat physical damage, ranges (15 to 25) to (38 to 45)) * Of Celebration (Attack speed, ranges 26 to 27) * Of Incision (Crit chance, range 35 to 38) * Of Destruction (Crit Multiplier, range 35 to 38) All of the rolls are T1, which is very very very rare. Even a "good/usuable" item might only have a single T1 roll at endgame. This is probably one of the best daggers in the game, plus it has one open prefix slot which you can further craft. 
Sorry, no.
It was all in good humour, don't worry. You simply said "are sat down" when it should be "are sitting". Also, its either one period or three, not two.  Hope I wasn't too mean. :)
*I shake my head* My mother is reigning lady, not me. I don't see why it matters whether or not I reign.
I'm kind of in the opposite situation to you. Sort of. I'm a male from an almost exclusively male household (except for my very Catholic mother), so I'm only recently becoming aware of gender issues. Not sure if I'd call myself a feminist or not yet. I'm still very new to the whole thing, which is why I make such a shitty spokesperson for it.  Really, what kept me from warming up to feminism for so long was the stupid misconceptions that are out there about it. I didn't know what it really meant until I met people who can explain it far better than I can. But even when I was a little kid, my mom would tell me stuff like "white males are the most oppressed group in America today" and... that just always never seemed right to me. So I would have come over to the "dark side" a lot sooner if it weren't for those stupid strawmen about feminism. That's why I think it's important to debunk this shit.  And, you know, I think it's part of a broader process of putting yourself in other peoples shoes. Really, all you have to do is *talk to an actual woman* about her experiences and the reality of sexism reveals itself.

&gt; First-wave feminism was justified with objective proof: that it was illegal for women to vote.  How does that objectively prove that the law was wrong? If we take as an assumption that the law was wrong, how does that objectively prove that first-wave feminism was the best way to go about fixing it? You don't have objective proof! How dare you try to push first-wave feminism on us without objective proof!  &gt; Your bias against feminism still made you assume that they were at fault, even though there is no mention of their fault whatsoever.  I'm not talking about the article! I'm talking about the actual events! The article isn't a perfect historical record of everything that occurred.  &gt; You're not making any sense. Let me instead ask: do you understand how women face unfair biases when they occupy male-centric jobs? It would be similar to what a man faces if he were a male nurse, secretary, or flight attendant.  "Understand" is a weird word to use here. I believe it, though. However, if I didn't trust anyone's anecdotal opinion, I would have trouble believing it. That is what I'm trying to get across.

Canada has a $44,000 GDP per capita. They have socialized medicine, great education opportunities, great infrastructure, etc. I'm not saying every Canadian is living perfectly or certain aspects shouldn't be improved, but what the fuck is up with these 18 year old redditors acting like any sort of foreign aid is the work of Satan? Africa and east Asian countries could use more help.  Helping out countries in times of need is not wrong, and I'm pretty sure close alliance with a country is worth more than 3.5 billion. Tl;dr let's grow up - helping out countries in need isn't the worst thing the Harper administration has done.

I like that idea, despite Brock not actually dying, Walt was definitely risking his life putting him in intensive care. It was a sacrifice   Personally I think Jesse was already on his side, and Walt could have approached it differently - but hey. More bomb stuff - This [cartoon](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130724220000/breakingbad/images/9/94/FarSide.jpg) in Gale's lab notes (Represents Walt plotting to kill Gale) The yellow equipment...[thingy?](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130719073706/breakingbad/images/a/ab/Superlab.jpg) in the lab, is reminiscent of a pair of lungs and looks a bit like a missile  In S2, Jesse and his guys meet in a [museum with bombs](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131003131642/breakingbad/images/0/0a/NMNSH.png)   Combo repeatedly stands in front of a picture of a mushroom cloud caused by a bomb  Badger says about Combo and Skinny Pete something like  "Fat Man and Little Boy, sounds like you two!" (The names of the two A bombs dropped on Hiroshima and then Nagasaki) When Walt spreads out the map of the city in front of Jesse and tells him to expand territory, it's a bit like 'this is where to ATTACK!' planning *war*, where to drop the bomb - (it is literally turf war) And then ,of course, the events from Combo's death actually cause a leadup to the plane crash which had a huge death toll

Just be there for her if she comes to you for advice.

Well regardless of whether that is or isn't a fact, which I'm still on the fence about, it does not justify you going around and persecuting every male that happens to prefer huge breasts. People are different and may or may not share similar interests, biases, and preferences, it is not your job to tell people what they should or shouldn't find attractive in prospective mates.

Have you been to /r/atheism recently? It's been pretty euphoric the past month. 
Yeah this is the response I was expecting, not to say that its a bad thing.

"Trust yourself more than what your mother (or anyone) says about you."   I thought she was right about me. I thought I was a bunch of terrible things that I really wasn't. It took me a long time to realize that she could be wrong, that I wasn't lazy or stupid or a slut (grounded for "being" that before my first kiss or first boyfriend!) and that yes, my natural inclination is to be kind of a traditional long haired "good girl." I kept trying to be what she said I was so that at least the punishment made sense. I acted that way to take the blame off her, because I couldn't believe she was wrong about me. She loved me and I had to be the messed up one.   I wish I knew that story wasn't true, that I could have trusted those feelings. I would have saved myself a lot of regret.

Ah sheesh, that's something I picked up in an undergrad classics course, let me see if I can find the textbook still. Might be somewhere, assuming I didn't get that as an anecdote from the professor (which usually stick with me since they're so interesting). I'll update in a few if I manage to find it.   Edit: Found it in "Classical Myth," by Barry B. Powell:  (Pg.2)- "Another element of my is setting. The setting is the time and place in which the action of the story unfolds. Myths are never set in the present or the recent past, the action always takes place in the distant past or in a shadowy time altogether outside human chronology. The setting of myths may be in an actual city, such as Athens or Thebes, or some other location familiar to the audience. In other myths, the setting is an obscure place: the underworld, which no one in the real world every visited; Mount Olympus, which really exists but in myth is the home of the gods; or Crete of a very long time ago."   So the Greeks therefore viewed a separation there, that of myth and physical presence.   There's a section, part of the answer. Just thought I'd update sooner and scan through, editing in if I find more. I'll keep digging.   Page 5-6, same book:  "The events of divine myth usually take place in a world before or outside the present order where time and space often have different meanings from those familiar to human beings."   Edit #3: To clarify, I'm not saying that the world of the gods was entirely separate to the ancient Greeks, they were absolutely connected, but their dwelling itself was as physical as it was mythical. It may be the same kind of logic in that the Christian "heaven" is up, yet not up, per say.   Edit #4: Concerning the taboo, Mount Olympus was also "far away an unapproachable," (Page 5, same book) so it was incredibly unlikely, in fact essentially impossible, for an ancient Greek to climb the mountain.   Edit#5: In continuing to answer whether they would have climbed Olympus, and the general impossibility of that feat, I'm consulting other works, this time searching through JSTOR, and found this in Langdon's article "Mountains in Greek Religion," Vol. 93, No. 5. in the journal "The Classical World:" "It is easy to understand why Greeks believed that their gods lived atop this mountain. It is the highest in mainland Greece, with a cluster of peaks reaching nearly 3,000 meters into the sky. These peaks are often obscured by clouds and seem more unapproachable than other heights. For practitioners of a sky-based religion, Olympos was seen quite naturally as  a divine residence." Edit #6: That's about what I have to say on the topic. And since nothing in ancient history can really be completely understood, one can either argue for two different aspects. Either that the ancient Greeks envisioned Mount Olympus physically and mythically, yet they intertwined in ways that we have trouble understanding in our modern context. Or you could say that the mountain itself, being unreachable by ancient standards, was the perfect place to have a mountain that no ancient would really question because it would always be a place of mystery, remaining essentially divine for all intents and purposes. Personally I'd like to think that it's both.   For all those still interested in the topic, Sale's article "Homeric Olympus and Its Formulae," found in Vol. 105, No. 1 of "The American Journal of Philology" has an absolutely exhaustive look at the mountain and its varying aspects and pantheon. It's quite confusing at times, but it's still a standard in the field I believe.  
do practice plans, that what i did! when i first started planing, it was very difficult, but after doing sever practice ones and several real ones, i got the hang of it. using the E6B is still a struggle for me (i usually forget what to look at for which thing im finding) but i figure it out and after, its really fairly easy and quick!  look up youtube videos, as well as searching google for some insight, good luck!

They've sold significantly more than $10m.  Their *profit* right now on compendiums is almost $22 million after you subtract the original prize pool.  Also, the stadium to hold the event will essentially pay for itself.  Also, I refuse to believe that they make loss on Dota2 on any other day of the year just to add to this.  Most of their money comes from fees for selling on the marketplace or selling other people's items in the in-game store.  They barely have to do anything these days besides balance the game and make characters which has significantly slowed down.

Two handed is best bet honestly. Dual wield is good for dark elves who are focused on PvE single target and group clear.  I run nord AD DK 2 handed sword for maximum Dps. Igneous Weapons, momentum, inferno, dragon breath, and dragon strike. Morphs: *molten armaments*; 28% crit to you and group for first 7 seconds of activating igneous weapons  *rally*; heals you at the end of Momentums duration   *flames of oblivion*; gives 11% crit chance (spell and melee)  against any enemy in infernos range   *searing strike*; the morph that makes it so dragon strike does more damage the longer it lasts   *engulfing flames*; morph that increases all flame damage by 7% against targets effected by your flame breath  I run medium armor for the 5%IAS (scales to 10 at48)  from dexterity at level 42 and crit chance passive from each piece of med armor equipt. Take fire enchants and get passive that increases all fire Damage by a flat %,  also get arcane fighter as it grants you 100% chance to cause burning each time you swing. This is a heavy magicka build that focuses on high single target and aoe clear speeds. I run a 2h sword with 10% IAS on top of 10% from dexterity and I swing super fast while retaining a 33% crit chance with flames on. It works well in PvP too as you replace igneous weapons and dragon breath with flame pull and critical charge.  I would ditch Stam builds unless you're going for a tank build.

Thanks for the kind words and feedback.  This is just my first concept art for the game so there's a lot of revisions ahead. I agree with what you said about the ground. I'm still trying to draw more plants and boulders and things to fill the space and figure out how it will fit on the game screen.  I tried to pick unusual colors for everything but still make it look recognizable as a jungle (which it doesn't yet, for lack of dense plants). Hopefully it'll have developed more by the next Screenshot Saturday.

Ah I knew it. I've never been so angry at a game in my life during that one. It took me 3 gazillion tries 
Which one was that?
I'm not doing anything about it, at all. I'm only fulfilling the "more obligatory" mandates, i.e., *work, support yourself*, and only barely since I still live with my parents and I can't negotiate a salary for my life. Like I said, the embarrassment and shock of finding out how much fun the rest is and was having (for instance, just thinking about the possibility of all the girls I fancied having had sex depresses me; not because they are "mine" or anything like that, but because it sounds like missed chances, whether I had I chance with them or not. That is, "look what you missed!") would be unbearable. It is unbearable.   But now, it's a private embarrassment, with a bit of willing ignorance about the whole thing ("well, maybe they didn't have so much fun every weekend...", "maybe they all had long dry-spells...", "maybe it's because their parents supported them fully economically and pay part of their rent..."). I'd rather keep it like that.
It's just too bad that so many groups rush through every mission so even if you wanted to, no time to admire the art (or the story, or the puzzles, or anything).
Sometimes when my cervix gets poked really hard that's where I feel the pain, it can be so bad that I puke.  I still really think you should get checked out though.
I'm not talking about caitlyn, I'm talking about  other people playing adcs who on their first back decide to rush zerks. Just the other day I saw a vayne rush zerks ahead of vamp, likewise for a draven. People in my elo appear to do this when they are forced into adc (as in their last preference) which seems to be why its never a problem on my team as I first pref the role.
Jonathan Livingston would fit this bill perfectly. 
I wouldve done it i could care less if its 85 id sell it for $60 ark for $40 i pick that stuff up for nothing so its not entirely impossible 
I have been saying for a while that we have upset some people because we are a force to be reckoned with. Personally I think this is why Doge is under attack. What are your thoughts on this. 
Mine are actually the opposite . I had to do a double take, but yeah, my copy is red and the other games are blue.Maybe it depends on where you're from?
Finally watched that episode yesterday. It's nice to see the context of these reactiongifs.
Yeah, it's got such a deep thumpy fuzz on the low end and a singing, smootjlh sustain on the upper strings. Great stuff.
very helpful, thanks!
Good point
I agree. And more to the point: that game made him look great because of our shit finishing, not his amazing goal keeping.  It was just commentators getting carried away with themselves every time Defoe or Soldado blasted a ball straight at him. Realistically he had maybe one or two difficult saves to make in the whole game.
hey, dont do anything yet please.. tell us whats going on.. what are you addicted to?
Crime, cleanliness (a friend of mine told me she's on more than one occasion had cockroaches crawling over her in a taxi), safety (taxi drivers care only for money, not your or the other passengers lives), racism, cultural differences (unless you have no respect for personal space and dont mind people in yours), harassment (if you're female and it follows on to things like rape), taxi violence (most of the drivers carry guns and will use them without hesitation). Shall I go on?  Also see this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_wars_in_South_Africa
Being in a wheel chair being pushed into walls, and having your mom ask random old men to sit on your lap for a ride.
Bigfoot is blurry, it's not the photographers fault. That's extra scary to me. There's a large out of focus monster roaming the country side. Run, he's fuzzy, get out of here!  -Mitchell 
Tell me what you think! Its my first ever attempt at a pack so leave some constructive criticism! I made some silly mistakes and forgot to edit some stuff. That should all be fixed soon!
Ian McKellan is up there too.  He was Death in Last Action Hero, Magneto in X-men, Gandalf in LOTR, and The Great Intelligence (aka Yog Sothoth) in Doctor Who.
Somehow reddit never told me you posted here and I'm just seeing it now!  I think it looks really cool!   Thanks!
Cardboard Crack is *not funny.*
Upvote just for the thumbnail picture :p  It might just be on my end but when I click on the link all the images are broken, not sure what is up there.
Not to mention local fire departments are begging people not to landscape close to structures with pine needles since they're ridiculously flammable.

My sister just went to the hospital for that. Lots of pain.
Both?
Thanks, I appreciate the input. I didnt know that was the case, I guess I can just install a new OS on it.
Write into the SAPOL Expiation Notice Branch to have the matter reviewed. If you've received multiple fines for driving unregistered and you weren't actually aware that the vehicle wasn't registered they will usually withdraw some of them. 
I'm glad someone else agrees finally. 
Totally fucking did. Crazy difference.
Probably getting downvoted because you can't spell defoe properly.
Just try to think back to John Buck April 2013. It's beautiful.
Okay, you set this to some French polka music and it it gets kind of creepy.
Cool lol. Just let me know. :P I do also have Swablu/Zigzagoon/Mew in that same box if you're interested in any of those instead haha

That's the one! Thanks for the ID. Hopefully this little guy will stay for a while.
The scale of what a machine like that would need to be able to do - in terms of breaking down materials, assembling them, obtaining and converting huge amounts of energy for propulsion, withstanding cosmic forces and remaining operative for eons, is mind-boggling.  So I wonder how practical that could ever be to do.  Something like that could also be a sort of cosmic virus, too =)  But I think Geronimo brought up the most important part.  On a sub-light time scale, the amount of time since the universe began for probes like you describe to propagate even within just our own galaxy is much smaller than you might think.  Let alone to propagate between galaxies.
If you look at the video, you see how many glitches there are and other aspects that should be finished for the time it was in development
enjoy it and don't forget the boundaries you've set, it's always more fun with them there
Ok then... I love the ability to purchase football specials. Going by your logic though this thread doesn't leave a lot of possibilities I'm afraid. Who cares where it was made.... 
I think Duel Bow would be more fitting.

If you only get it for the first win, what would happen for people that started off in 150CC?  I finished on 50 because I haven't played MK in a long time, got first in all races and cups but still have quite a few question marks under characters.  If I had started on 150, I'd still have characters left to get.  How would I get them if it's only your first win?

I've never called myself a girl gamer. I never found a reason to point out the fact I was a chick, it doesn't mean anything. We're playing games together so me having a vagina does not add to the situation. It's rare I get any comments about being a girl when I'm gaming, though I've had it happen. No worst than dealing with griefers though. A mute button is a wonderful deterrent. 
Goosebumps #54: Don't Go to Sleep!
Hmmm, its definitely possible you might be onto something!
My theory is that the perceived lack of humanity has a disproportionate psychological impact.   If you want to kill someone and want to do it in the most honorable way possible, you challenge them one on one when they can defend themselves. A step down the honor ladder is to kill them when you have an advantage (technological, strategically, etc), another step step down is to kill them when you have an advantage and they are defenseless, the bottom rung would be sending someone else to kill them while they are defenseless and the assassin has an advantage.   Drones seem unfair and dishonorable because it represents a large, powerful force killing an enemy remotely. There is little defense against a drone and even shooting it down doesn't kill a pilot. If a drone comes after you, surviving is all you can hope for. It's not a fight, it's an execution.   To me, that's the major distinction between drone bombing and conventional bombing, and to me it's a minor one.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_American#Religious_background  63% are Christian and 24% are Muslim. It isn't all that surprising when you look at where Arab Americans are coming from.   &gt; The largest subgroup is by far the Lebanese Americans, with 501,907,[1] followed by; Egyptian American with 190,078, Syrian American with 148,214, Iraqi American with 105,981, Palestinian American with 93,438  The above wiki quote shows which countries Arab Americans are coming from. The top 5 countries have decently large Christian populations and have all experienced certain amounts of conflict that would drive Christians out of their homeland.   And as for your experiences, I suspect its most likely just a bias of your circle or possibly your area. I am also an Arab and meet way more Christians than Muslims. You might also not notice most Christian Arabs especially when a large amount of them from Syria and Lebanon have either French or Saint first names and relatively lighter skin.

http://www.spacex.com/dragon  Look at the section *"Inside the Spacecraft" &gt; Crew*, or just generally all over that page, and you can see how there's collaboration with NASA.  In case you weren't aware, after the shuttle retirement, the US no longer has the capability to put people into space. They (NASA, the US Gov't, etc...) are banking on SpaceX to develop this capability. Hence the Dragon development (the spacecraft that is pictured in this post).  Happy reading.  *EDIT:* Also, this: http://www.spacex.com/press/2012/12/19/nasa-selects-spacex-return-americans-space
absolutely! 
Depends I suppose. If they truly knew she was with you and still did it a punch to the throat is in order. 
Most serious is inability to use mods that grant the game serious replayability factor (like NPC mods and more important Sword Coast Stratagems which makes combat more tactically nuanced and less cheesy).  Also BG EE added content (especially new NPCs and some out of the place items) really falls behind the original one in terms of writing and voice acting. And the writing was never the strong part of BG 1.  As I mentioned before I believe there is no way to increase the FPS in EE, which makes the game more of a walking simulator than an RPG game. Modifying the .ini file did not work for me.  Basically you are paying more for a product that adds nothing that couldn't be gained by some easy to install mods and all it adds is content (items, annoying NPC's with bad dubbing, cringeworthy 'romances' that were absent in the original) of questionable quality.
i don't have hybrids to trade i'm sorry ! but if you're still interested in giving me purple roses for bells/ores please tell me c:

It's funny how it instantly struck me as not PC, but the more I thought about it, it's just a guy in his customary attire stating his name and that he enjoys the game.  What the hell is wrong with us that makes this seem offensive?
I'm 32 and bought a cassette of Doggystyle when I was 11 so I'm very familiar with the era we are discussing.  While I don't really agree with you entirely,  thanks for a thoughtful reply.  I will get back to the subject when I have a bit to gather my thoughts.
You're welcome, and just to clarify it is very playable on my pc, i just get 40ish fps in big areas with high/medium settings. I would think that you'd get an ok frame rate on low settings but I guess the game just hates amd. If you really wanna play it you could always consider upgrading your pc.

&gt;my friend has a blakc baby.  Color doesn't matter. The actual baby is what will probably cause some hesitation.
Sounds to me that this has nothing to do with the administrator actually thinking this was racist. If I had a guess they were looking for a way to fire him so that he wouldn't get his pension/retirement benefits. Hopefully it backfires on them.
Sure, but you get holy water on tap, so there's that.
Celtic is a hot-spot for date-rape as well. I have heard from two separate girls about being slipped drugs at Celtic. Not a slam against the staff. I don't blame the staff. Service does still suck, though. 
Wow.  Well, I guess it could work for a series finale.  But you can't kill all the characters and still have a show, right?  I suppose they could reboot with all new previously unknown clones for season 3.  But I don't expect that.  I'd like to see:  - Rachel redeemed, and replaced as archvillain by a still unknown figure at a higher level of the conspiracy. - Allison come out as clone to Donnie. They reunite. - Cosima alive, but critical, as a cliffhanger for next season.  Lots of cophine feels. - Helena kicking major fishcult ass in fierce "mother bear" mode. - Paul dies while redeeming himself.  With lumberjack in the picture we don't need him as a romantic partner for Sarah, but I still want him to be good.  It'll never happen, but I just want all the clones to be safe and love each other.
If I ever lose a hand, I know the first thing I'm doing with it.

Fuck. I didn't want to be teary eyed tonight. This reminds me of my poor little guy Chaplin. We let him roam outside while he was still young. I still remember hearing the meows and thinking "silly cats" before I went to bed. Turns out he was hit by a car that night and froze to death on the street and was meowing out for help. We found him the next morning and I can barely finish this comment. :( We wrapped him up in a small blanket and packaged him into a little box, before burying him under our orange tree. Then we had a little funeral to remember him. I really miss Chaplin. :(
If you're asking if the CPU gradually gets fucked and runs the stuff it's been running before slower than it did. I've never noticed that with any of my CPUs.   And if that wasn't what you were asking, the answer would be when programs become too complicated for it to run at a decent speed. When that will happen, nobody knows.

Front nails grow faster because as we were evolving and walking on 4 legs the nails on the front would wear down quicker while doing things like digging holes. The longest toes contact the ground the most and also wear down the quickest, hence why the nail on your middle finger grows the fastest. 
Op seemed to be right in this case, but I definitely get your point and I agree with you as well. Even with gender you have to be careful., I knew a couple guys names "Stacey" my ex was named "Dana", and my former co-worker's full name is "Leslie". All guys. You honestly never know.

IDK if I will get anything because i'm so late, but i'll try anyways. I'm looking to get something similar (if not identical) to [this keyboard](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=473), but it is sold out and idk if that particular color scheme will ever get restocked. I'm looking for a similar color scheme and PBT caps with blue switches. It doesn't matter if it is backlit or not, and if it exists I would also be open to side printed keycaps. Does anything close to this exist? Thanks!
Or, this is what Amazon suggests, as the requester even mentions. So I do have a clue.

Good god, I have a lesson plan where I bring I teach about the history of the "n" word because I'm sick and fucking tired of all kids throwing it around like it's a frisbee.   Part of the plan involves blackface, and show them local city newspapers advertising a black face show in a playhouse that is still very popular. It transitions in to Japanese Incarceration. God forbid I present the complicated history of racism in our country to help foster a conversation and hopefully racial sensitivity in  a public classroom.

That's really rough, I'm sorry to hear it.   I guess it really comes down to what *you* want to do. Letting yourself feel and go through the emotions is scary and could bring up more than you want it to, but it most likely healthier in the long run.   Pushing stuff down the way that it sounds like you've down in the past might get you through the next little bit, but long term it can be unhealthy and cause issues.   What you do is entirely up to you, and no one can tell you what choice is right for you except for you. Sometimes there is no easy answer unfortunately. I wish I could make it easier or do something other than just talk to you...

Your quote actually give more evidence that this was a bad ejection.  He was *not* warned to stop, continuing afterwards.  He walked out calmly, barely said a word, and in 2 seconds was gone without a single word from the ump.  The ump messed up, in terms of common sense, the rules, and obviously later in how he handled the game.  This was disgusting to see.

You can absolutely sell alcohol on the black market on planets where it is outlawed. 
Your father is a financial adviser. Do you feel embarrassed asking him to help you learn some of these things? He might be proud to know you are trying to take the reins. It does sound like you should work with him especially in terms of learning what your options are for receiving either student aid or student loans for graduate school.   Before you sit down with your dad on that topic, though, you may want to do some reading to improve your grasp of basics of personal finance. There are some books written specifically for younger people just out of school. I've listed the book numbers to help you search for them.  *Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties*, by Beth Kobliner. ISBN 978-0-743-26436-5.  *Life After School. Explained*, by Cap &amp; Compass. ISBN 978-0-971-73660-3.  *The Wealthy Barber: Everyone's Commonsense Guide to Becoming Financially Independent*, by David Chilton. ISBN 978-0-761-51311-7.  *Your Money: The Missing Manual*, by J.D. Roth. ISBN 978-0-596-80940-9.  You may eventually want to do more directed learning related to investing, and when you do, people here can easily recommend the best books.  I find that reading a few commonsense introductory books helps make things feel a little less overwhelming. At the very least, they may point out some things to think about that you might have ignored. Not everything may apply to your situation, but having some exposure to the ideas will pay off down the road.  But definitely talk with your father, especially during the upcoming time when you're looking at financing further education. It may also be a time of establishing yourself on your own, which brings with it budgeting, housing, and other issues.
Don't forget about the shitty hdr profile picture.

It's good that you're taking the first step - it took me a long time to realise that I actually had a problem with alcohol. Having that realisation means that you can start doing something about it.  I saw in one of your other replies that you weren't great in social situations - I can see how AA might be difficult in those circumstances. At very least, stick around here. It's a good place (I posted here daily for the first 14 days just to help me stick with it).
Pretty much this.  Although I find it's pretty easy to pick the right spots to bluff @ 1/2 live games.

Yeah. I've stayed out of the conversations for the most part, but I've seen a few pretty heated debates on my Facebook wall about the NotAllMen meme, and that's pretty much the point that non-feminists are making. Saying "Black people like to rob liquor stores" would be pretty damn racist, and what these feminists are doing is no different. And from what I've seen, the NotAllMen issue is supported by pretty much every feminist that I've seen talk about it, the only people opposing it have been non-feminists.
He personified and brought the character to life, yeah it's a little campy, but it's highly entertaining and evocative of the character.
I like El-P, but I feel like a lot of his beats sound very very similar. Run the Jewels could be 1 big song, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It's just way too repetitive. He's not a bad producer, but honestly it's like DJ Mustard and his signature beat, except at least DJ Mustard's beat is easier to listen to for a long period of time and is a lot more accessible.  As a rapper, I actually like El-P a lot. He and Mike have really really great chemistry on Run the Jewels and they both go pretty goddamn hard during the whole thing. El-P's got some hidden gems of lines on RtJ, too. He's not a bad rapper at all.  My only issue with El-P is his beats. It's not a bad beat, it's just too much. And yes, I've listened to Cancer 4 Cure and shit, I still think he's repetitive.  Obviously not ALL of his beats are like that, but a lot of them are.

Are you going for "goed zo"? Because what you just said means "gutter so!'
I agree, and I don't think Dallas will go for him either. They've already invested a decent chunk of change in Calderon and Ellis, and I think Calderon's contract is too big to move, but also too much to pay a non-starter. If they could move calderon though, Bledsoe/Ellis combo would be a lot of fun, plus the kick outs to dirk.   They will probably try to spend their cash on a 3, dependent on what marion wants to do. possibly deng? I have heard Pauly P but he's not the defender he used to be. A starting roster of calderon/ellis/pierce/nowitzki would be disastrous defensively.  They will also try to get a defensive big. Dalembert was pretty solid but he is getting older and has had injury troubles in the past

This has become true for car chases as well. They follow from safe distance and get air support where possible. Since you can't outrun a radio and one reckless driver is bad enough, police are well advised not to add risk.

I suppose you read like 3 reddit comments and then judged a whole fanbase of one of the most popular LoL teams out there right? Your logic is so flawed just because some kid with a TSM flare says he's jumping off the bandwagon doesn't mean that's how the whole fanbase acts. Your post is totally biased by the fact that you *hate* TSM and doesn't promote good thoughtful conversation. It just promotes a bunch of fanboys to rage at each other over how salty one team is.
very smooth graphics! pretty addictive, i like it!
No way team BAND; I mean if that's your standard for "stays caving too long" I don't get where you're coming from at all.  And BTC ran a bit ridiculously far after the fight, but as you yourself point out, he was in one; and he never even really got a chance to cave.  I don't know, I think you expect so much.  You're not even entirely right when you say the earlier seasons were comparatively ok -- season 7 team UK, season 8 Pakratt, for instance.  I just don't find it to be the kind of "this *always* happens, the sky is falling!" occurrence that I'm sure it's going to be portrayed as if PiP wins.

I saw an interesting program about orca whales recently. Researchers have deduced that each pod of whales has a unique dialect. Dialects from different pods seems to be as diverse as languages around the world.  If dolphins are similar, which I'd guess they are both being relatively smart warm blooded ocean predators with complex social interaction, my guess would be they don't understand each other.

Most high end steak houses use Prime and most markets stop at Choice.  
Prison is no reformation tool.  The system is a revolving door.  Once you're in, especially if you have a felony, your life is going to be a lot worse off.  Nobody is going to want to hire you.  So good luck getting a job.  No job?  No money.  But like snoop says you gotta have paper in this world.  So what do the criminals do?  More crime to make money.  I bet the good majority of them after coming out of hell (i.e. prison) would love to straighten up and get a job and work hard to earn their way.  But most people don't give them a chance.  So they hussle.  I really hate the way it's setup.  Once upon a time there was enough funding to have a lot of mental hospitals around, which is where a good majority of the prisoners belong.  The majority of prisoners suffer from some sort of mental illness.  And now that there isn't a bed for them at Bellevue they find themselves in a bed in the state pen.  But the ironic (and sad thing) is that it comes full circle.  These people live amongst us.  They're that miserable SOB that cut you off on your way home.  They're the sour puss at Walmart screaming at their kids.  They're the guy who goes on a violent rampage and kills your significant other, sibling, mom or dad or whatever.  Society is turning into a real toilet because it's getting harder and harder to make your way.  The 1%ers better start setting up gated communities because as things get worse over time they'll want to segregate themselves from the dangers of society.  It's a very complicated problem.  And it's so transparent that I don't think a lot of people realize this is happening.  But a lot do.  Without looking, just think to yourself how many school shootings you can remember before Columbine.  I can't remember any.  And now it's unreal how many times people are getting shot at school, work or the gym (yes the gym in Pittsburgh a few years back which is where I'm near).

Amina Tyler wasn't physically abused.  &gt; And can I please see some evidence Tunisia isn't ulraconservative? Besides men going about in Western clothing; men having more freedom is kind of a given.  So if daubing yourself in painted slogans and running around screaming at people topless is seen as abnormal, it's by default some strict-dress code everyone-wears-at-least-a-headscarf sort of country?  Yeah, no.
does this community only exist at max level?  I have gotten 10 days free time to casually level and I have not found the community to be anything of note anymore.  In many instance runs I have not had a single soul speak to me.  I rarely see people in my zones, despite the whole cross-realm zones thing and when I do they run past.   I know that this is the tail end of the expansion, but it's still a very off-putting way to spend the first 80+ levels of the game

You don't consider the medical field in general to be a science? There's a whole lot if doctors out there who would disagree with you.
Weird thing is masculinity and strength solves a lot of problems that women face. Afraid that guys are stronger than you can could take advantage of that through rape and or domestic violence? Lift some weights and become as strong as them. It's pretty much what guys do before and while they are in prison because it is a possibility. Am I saying the world is a prison? No, but if you are going to be afraid for your life like you are in one, take the necessary actions to defend yourself. Women need to man the fuck up some times.

"You were threatened by a student named Milo with a box cutter. I was there to defend you, and you ran off thinking that I was with the other student. Understandable with your condition."

I run off to the gate and leave.
"Here are a bunch of references to the first game" is fine.  But it's not fine when that's what makes up the game in its entirety. And that's his point. That's not how a sequel is "supposed to work."   The point is that the lore is really weak, and the story is really weak, but the game tries to make up for it by simply having many references to the first game. The hope would be that the sequel to Dark Souls would have lore nearly as strong and in-depth, along with a story nearly as strong and in-depth, *along* with the references to the first game.
Cool, let me know if you see anything. Everything I've seen from econo-bloggers (and my own limited data expeditions) seems to be indicating that the FT substantially overreached with their claims.  Some relevent tweets:  [Amir Sufi](https://twitter.com/profsufi/status/472360414328930305)  &gt; Been too busy this week to follow this, but seems like in last few days Piketty has completely crushed the FT challenge. Correct?  &gt; Ok looked more carefully at Piketty FT dust up. Piketty easily wins. Mixing survey and administrative data in UK pretty basic mistake.  [Justin Wolfers](https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers)  &gt; Piketty reply decimates the FT.  &gt; Summary: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/30/upshot/thomas-piketty-responds-to-criticism-of-his-data.html?rref=upshot …  &gt; Piketty's blow-by-blow: http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/capital21c/en/Piketty2014TechnicalAppendixResponsetoFT.pdf …  &gt; Debate's over folks.  &gt; The FT asked good questions. Their mistake was to presume there were no good answers. Piketty showed there were. There's no smoke, no gun.  &gt; Fave bit: Piketty says FT's #s "would mean that Britain is currently one  the most egalitarian countries in history..more equal than Sweden"  &gt; Importantly the FT no longer insists that wealth inequality data disagree w/ Piketty's narrative. We're down to quibbles about documentation  ***  Sufi and Wolfers are making very strong claims here, it doesn't look like ideological wagon circling to me.
yes
It makes sense, if all the material is used in that package, there's less packaging material for use in other stuff.  Seems logical
When I mentioned that there are no TAs, what I meant is that students are taught by professors, not their student assistants, as is often the case in big US universities.   There are some becas, research grants and assistantships, but none for non-EU foreign students (you could try to get a Fulbright). The cost of a degree here is still much less than the cost of one in the US (even though it has gone up astronomically in the past few years). For example, tuition for a Master's in International Relations costs around 4000 euros if you complete everything in one year.   As to whether it's respected outside of Spain--I would imagine so in Latin America--otherwise I don't really know… Anyone in Spain would certainly understand the difficulty involved for a foreigner to earn a degree at one of its universities. It certainly opens doors here. 
They put that on your wall?

It would depend on the severity of the crime though I would assume?
The food one reminds me of that "real" hidden camera commercial for Walmart steaks where they served walmart steaks at a five star restaurant without telling anyone, and the "customers" wouldn't shut up about how amazing the steak was.
that would be an awesome game though.
Besides Lords (Who get you game overs on death), there are usually only a few story-important characters that "retire" instead of dying, because the game wouldn't be able to go on without them. Usually, but not always, a couple of them are from the beginning of the game, and then a couple more from throughout the game. It's sadly going to annoy you, because these "retirees" (for lack of a better term) are in all of the games.  However, Awakening has an awful lot of characters who only retire on classic mode death, instead of actually dying. The opening four characters don't die, all of the 1st-gen mothers don't die (because of time paradoxes or something like that otherwise), and a couple of others. No other game really rivals these numbers, but FE7 (Titled "Fire Emblem" in English), is most likely the next, due to it being a prequel and thus not being able to kill some characters due to time-paradox creation.
Yup. Last week I was bored and watched an episode of Firefly on Netflix for the first time in awhile. I thought Kaylee made a great cat name.  =)

Your car is so clean! 
Can someone reverse this please?
&gt; Yep. And you saying that there's loads of data suggesting bans do work to reduce crime with whatever the banned item is is equally you just saying that.  &gt;The final report concluded the ban’s success in reducing crimes committed with banned guns was “mixed.” Gun crimes involving assault weapons declined. However, that decline was “offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with [large-capacity magazines].”  http://www.factcheck.org/2013/02/did-the-1994-assault-weapons-ban-work/  this is specifically related to assault weapons bans, and shows that the ban was effective at reducing crime committed with assault weapons.  But was largely replaced with gun crime with other firearms.  As a measure of cutting down on crime, it's debatable whether or not the ban was successful, as for cutting down on a specific type of crime, ie. assault weapon crimes, the ban was extremely successful.  It would appear that even though they were going to commit murder anyway, those criminals really did respect the ban and used something different.  I'm not saying this thing couldn't be used for self defense, but it could only be useful in certain situations where there was a long drawn out escalation, ie. you had time to fish through your purse, find this thing, slot your fingers in it and then fight the person in hand to hand combat.  It's not the same as having a spring loaded knife on your belt, or a holstered open carry gun.  Furthermore, there is no latent ability for this thing to deter crime, since it would be hidden in your purse or pocket until you pull it out, and at that point the crime is presumably already underway.
Yeah that is true.   I do love all these over sized phones though. I very rarely use my phone for actually talking. Outside of calling work or a friend to find their location I just text. I have 60 minutes of talk time a month and barely use half of it.   A 6" 4k phone with and awesome camera is awesome for me.

I feel you there.  I'm terribly overweight, 350 lbs at 6'2'', I guess I carry it better then some people but overall I don't care that I'm fat, I just care about other people's perceptions of me and what they say about me. I shouldn't, but I do.  So when I see a woman even slightly skinnier then me I think that they think I'm a joke and I'm fat and all this other stuff and basically I don't have the right to even speak to them.  Which is why I was pleasantly surprised at her reaction.  Maybe she was laughing at me in her head.  I don't know, but it seemed positive at the time.
No matter where you go or what you do or who you do it with ... most people object to ANY change.   I am absolutely sure that some will lament the "good old days" before SpaceX but there may be many that will benefit from the additional jobs and income to South Texas.  I can see this launch site as SpaceX getting thier foot in the door with one or two launch pads and up to 12 launches per year. Perhaps, this site will expand to accommodate the MCT within the next couple decades. Perhaps the launch rate will INCREASE in the future.   From what I have read so far, here is the rub ... will SpaceX be able to LAND the launchers (first stages and second stages) ...  and potentially Dragon's at this site. I think it might be a wee bit small!  Apparently, from what I haver read, those who reside on or very near the beaches will still have access even on launch days.   Here is where I see the rub ... if SpaceX wants to launch mostly on public holiday weekends and especially if the weather is great ... the locals will have a field day.

Yeah I knew this drug dealer since high school I wasn't close friends with him that we hung out or called each other but I knew him well enough we talked to each other at parties and stuff. But in high school he was a big weed dealer he was the "go to" person for weed, and I use to buy weed from him it's the only drug I've done and will ever do but I haven't smoked for 2 years now. Anyways he would rack in like 300-500 bucks a week when he was in high school not bad for him!. But as years passed he started selling more hardcore drugs like pills,meth, all that junk that ruins your life I probably haven't seen him for about 4 years after high school I have a full time job, house, car and I got invited to a old high school party from a friend so I accepted and went I still had work in the morning but I wasn't going to stay long when I got there what do you know I saw the drug dealer (I'm just going to call him drug dealer). He greeted me asked how I been I told him and I asked him the same thing he told me he has no job but he has a house and 2 cars! He had a Cadillac and bought a Toyota celica at the dealership I asked how he afforded all this? He pulled me to the other room opened his back pack and what I saw was the most money I have ever seen just stacks of rolled rubber band stacked money 10 grand worth! I said why the hell you have 10 grand with you he told me he's just been collecting money all day and hasent been home yet to drop it off. So it was about 2 in the morning by now I had to go to work around 8 in the morning and needed sleep and the drug dealer was piss drunk I said good bye to everyone and left the next morning my friend that had the party told me to call him on my lunch break I did and he told me the drug dealer was so wasted last night he went to go do a drug deal and he got jumped beaten with bats and shot with a .22 hand gun and all his money jacked he got brain damage and that's all I've heard since of him.

I don't think your sentimate is completely true. Would a higher alien species contact us for resources/help as we would an amoeba? No, probably not. However would they contact us for the sake of learning more about us? Why not? We are trying to learn about amoeba and even try our hardest to find bacteria on other planets/moons (which are much less advanced than we are), it would not be outrageous to think a advanced alien species that catches wind of us would want to see what we are all about.

It's like people say about the mosquitoes: just because you don't know their purpose, doesn't mean they don't have one.

"Works."
But it exists on the same number line. We can even take it a step further. Between 2 and 3 there are an infinite amount of numbers. If you start at 2.1 or even 2.9, there's still an infinite amount. You don't need to include every possibility to have infinity.  We're also talking about whole universes here (which can be represented by whole numbers). Unlike a number line, there aren't infinite components of universes within a single universe (represented by decimals). I suppose you could say whole numbers (universes) represents one set of infinity, while decimals (a single universe) represents another set of infinity. But we're assuming that each single universe is infinite, which we don't know. Also, if we remove one of these infinite universes from the infinite line of universes, there's still an infinite amount of universes. Again, it's not necessary for a "world" of infinite universes to contain every possibility.   Also, this requires a philosophical discussion about identity. What does it mean to be 'you'? A philosophy professor from Yale did a four part lecture about identity if you're interested. The first part can be found [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00KDsArsQ3A&amp;list=PLEA18FAF1AD9047B0&amp;index=11). If there's another universe with another 'you', is it really you? I personally don't think so. Although you may be arranged in the same way, and you have the same personality, etc - you're not made with the same exact material and the other you lacks your phenomenological experiences. Only one you exists - all others are replicas. If you subscribe to that belief then there are already an infinite number of hypothetical universes of which you're involved that do not exist.

I have no idea what the hell stag do is. Can you elaborate? I get that it's guys only, but I'm so uncomfortable with how the words are being used, my poor brain needs clarification.   Anyway, she's being crazy. How long have you been married? Kids?  She isn't acting out for no reason, there's always something, whether we or they see it or known it or not. The problem is, it could be anything.   I would guess, since she is so hell bent on permissions, that you carry on and have a life outside your house - and perhaps she doesn't? She's feeling left out for some reason and sucks at communication. Even if it's something else, like she has something else on we mind, it's still expressing this way because of shit communication.   Does that make sense? Something is wrong. Either she doesn't realize it or is being even crazier and wants you to guess, but either way, this shit is never random.   There is something on her mind and you (you or her or both) suck at communication. It's got nothing to do with your trip.

I tend to agree more with the people who say that all these extraneous conditions are but simply a part of the fantasy experience and should be things to consider just like in any other type of fantasy sports. Game duration should be something that you, as the knowledgeable fan, should think about when you make a trade, pick of a free agent, or draft a player.   For example, in football, it's important to note how a team distributes the amount of runs each of its running backs receives throughout the game. A team might give a 50/50 split to its RBs, causing a limitation of play time that one of its RBs may have in a game compared to another team that splits the runs of 60/40 or 70/30. Yet yards per carry isn't included in the scoring of any leagues.  So, in LoL, it's important to know the tendencies of teams as a whole. Does a team tend to have drawn out games that extend their fantasy scores? Then you should consider drafting players from that team even if the players aren't top tier. Does a team have a phenomenal mid-laner, but doesn't get the time to shine and rack up those fantasy points? Then maybe you should consider leaving that player to another team.   I think the best way to go is to add more things to score by. Points for vision-related stats. Tweak the KDA point values to something that rewards Kills and Assists more and penalizes deaths more. Hell, I think that incorporating Red and Blue buff kills should be incorporated into scoring somehow.

I learned to sew, I was taught by my dad actually. This is because my dad owns an upholstery/tarpmaking company (they actually make stuff for airline ground support but it is hard to explain) and I used to work for him. I used to make costumes and occasionally my own clothes, but was never very good at clothing since I learned on industrial machines with tarp fabrics, generally doing tasks that required less precision.   I don't sew much anymore because I don't work for him anymore, but I own three sewing machines (one is a decorative antique Singer, the other is a secondhand Singer from the 1960s that I actually use, the third is a specialty machine called a serger that I can't seem to get to work properly 'cause it has like four needles and threading it is just whaaaat).

I don't mean to be sarcastic here, but...good luck getting into a raid man.  Warriors are tanks, they are set up as tanks and even in rediculously good gear with full str build, a 115 weapon and full 110 str accessories the best I've seen a warrior do is 360 dps in freaking coil with the 15% echo.  It is not a viable spec, it would be like trying to make a blm with mind gear so you can never run oom while spamming physic...yes it works but no one is going to bring you on raids because the classes built for that role will do it better than you can.
Wow such close, very cheese

Having not seen the video I can only guess but, he was probably arrested for being a condescending douchebag.  He gave the cop an excuse to arrest him because he refuse to cooperate,  he didn't stay arrested because he didn't give him a "good excuse."  moral of the story, if you're going to be an ass to the police make damn sure you have the law on your side and the incident on tape.   It also helps if you are white...

Yes, all of that too.  The SAT isn't an intelligence test.  (And heck, it's arguable whether our IQ tests are even good measures of intelligence... or what intelligence even is.)

I must ask, where did you require this?
Batman's face is the best thing I've seen all day.
Thank you, well this is already going better than expected.
Ok…Welp if you want an honest opinion…  Game boosters are complete shit, they do everything you can control in systems control on windows OS and still require (although often very limited memory usage) memory during gaming operations.   The operations of a program like RAPTR/Razor are really doing are just a very simple version of memory management.   This can very easily be fixed by CNTRL-ALT-Deleting and essentially deallocating (closing) programs such as your anti virus, firefox and other high memory programs that the operating system is allocating memory in the stack or queue (forgetting which Windows uses) and are running background operations.  All things like priority (i.e. setting it to high) tells the operating system that this is the 2nd most important thing running except for the operating system, in all actuality it provides little to none in the performance boost section. Overall it should just effect running stability  What you really should be examining is the specs of your computer.  32 bit OS is limited to 4gb of memory, especially older laptops and desktops (2007-2009) are still running 32 bit. This severely limits the performance and execution of background programs due to windows requiring a portion of that 4gb. This leaves about 3.5 (or less) GB to run SWTOR and your background applications.   SWTOR is extremely cpu intensive, and requires a half decent processor to get stable and decent FPS. This is partially due to the HERO engine and the fact that the attacks you see on screen all rely heavily on the CPU to track calculations and manage data(health/etc).  **TL;DR Stop using the after market products, turn down your graphics. If their on very low, it's time to look for an upgrade**  if you want help feel free to ask.   
Why don't you make that same group but instead of doing it just for likes, make it a group that focuses on your industry and provide advice/help for everyone, you know, to like improve the products. OMG that's even better than likes!

The data you're looking for is generally available for free from your local central bank or equivalent institution. Key word: generally. But if you are looking information for an OECD member you should be fine.  Some tips:  * Be ready to copy webpage information into a spreadsheet. You won't always find data in XLS format. But copying tables into excel is easy if you use Internet Explorer (crappy, I know; but it works better than firefox and chrome for this specific issue -- there may be plugins that facilitate this on FF or Ch but I haven't looked for one).  * You won't find conversion rates for USD-Euro for 1975. Try british pounds (pound sterling).  * There are also paid data repositories. It's been a while since I've needed to work with this kind of data, but I think most of what you need is available for free.  Hope this helps.

Containers that pour without making a mess. We have some things, but there are still kettles, condiments, salad dressings, and bottles that dribble all over the place when you try to pour from them.
I've always wanted to see Eddie Izzard, and I guess George Carlin goes on the list with Richard Jeni and Mitch Hedburg as guys I kept putting off, and putting off, and now it's too late. I'll take a pass on Pauly Shore, though.  That's the nice part about living near NYC. If there's a comedian I really, really want to see, it's generally not too long until they'll be around. I should really see if there's anyone interesting coming around soon.  Lewis Black is another excellent show, if you get the chance. 
Yeah, because self-respecting men don't have any respect for women who think they should be equal to men... 
I'm not sure what that is, but have you tried messing with the addon options?
I think pro-life does mean anti-abortion. Pro-choice means pro-choice. Not to have an abortion is a choice; it's only the pro-lifers who believe their choice is the only valid one.
Yeah that battery life seems great. No worrying "Is my reticle on?" Thanks.

Thank you.  As a very new shibe, I just assumed that it was plummeting.  I did not have the benefit of this historical perspective.  Previous posts have just been "chin up" "keep calm" propaganda, without any supporting factual context.  Thanks to the detailed historical insights that you provided, I not only know that holding on is the right thing to do -- I BELIEVE IT.

You couldn't be further from the truth in all aspects. I will speak as a resident of Arizona about the specifics of our gun laws here....or lack of them.   Gun regulation does absolutely nothing because 99% people who choose to do crimes with their guns are people who have obtained them illegally and will not register them. It is stupid to purposefully commit a crime with something that is linked specifically to you. Think about it logically, if you were to shoot someone would you do it with a firearm that was registered with the government under your name or would you illegally purchase one that had no records then get rid of the firearm after the crime was committed?   The government doesn't tell people what guns to use for home protection. There is absolutely no regulation on what an individual may use, be it a .22lr pistol or a .50BMG rifle. Common sense is what dictates this, most people use a shotgun or small caliber pistol such as a 9mm for home defense because if you shoot something like a rifle and the bullet travels through a wall and hits someone else you are now guilty of murder at worst and manslaughter at best.   As I have stated on here multiple times, the process to get a fully automatic rifle takes at least 6 months, involves federal gov't (BATFE) and local law enforcement approval and costs a substantial amount of money. Steps only a responsible, law abiding citizen would go through and pass. People who own these kinds of rifles are typically the most responsible gun owners in the nation, many of them are federally licensed and own gun shops. As a gun owner and avid Second Amendment supporter, I agree that a select fire AR15 is too much power for home defense. I would like to think that a vast majority of gun owners would agree with that. That being said, the Second Amendment isn't for self defense or hunting...it exists to protect citizens from an over-reaching tyrannical government. In Arizona, there is virtually no regulation of firearms. To purchase at a store takes about 20 minutes, faster if you are a Concealed Carry permit holder. You do the paperwork, the run a NICS background check with the FBI, if you pass you pay for your firearm and leave the store with it. Private trades/buying/selling is completely unregulated. As long as you meet the federal requirements and can legally own a gun you have free reign to buy and sell whatever you want as though it were nothing more than a television. We the people of this great state regulate everything. The vast majority are law-abiding citizens, many are police officers and military. We follow every single law in place, and many go above and beyond to do background checks on people even though it isn't mandatory. If we see any suspicious behavior, it immediately gets called out and reported to the police. We as gun owners respect firearms and our right to own them. It is not something we take lightly, and we don't need the government to tell us how to regulate them. We do it on our own. We also have an extremely low crime rate throughout the majority of the state. The only exception is in downtown Phoenix because of the gangs, but that is how every major city is. Taking guns from law-abiding citizens isn't going to change the gang problem there and will only serve to create more victims of gang related violence. That being said, Phoenix is the 6th largest city in the nation yet has one of the lowest violent crime rates out of all the major cities. Most every major city in America alone has a higher gun violence rate than the entire state of Arizona even when combined with a number of other Pro-gun states.    &gt;I've never fired a gun myself, and even so, I dont understand the obsession with them. But a bolt action, a shotgun, and a pistol are all you'd ever need for even the most unlikely of circumstances by my understanding.    Lets use hurricane Katrina as an example. Society completely broke down, there was looting, robbery, violence and mass hysteria everywhere. Lets say you and your family live in ground zero of the anarchy. Your home is virtually destroyed, you are holed up in the corner of what is remaining, your children are hungry as you only have minimal supplies and the world is crashing down on top of you. Next thing you know a mob of 10-15 people start walking around the rubble of your home. You know they are violent because you just saw them violently attack, rape then murder your neighbor.   You are anti-gun so you never thought to buy one....how do you plan to defend your children who will most likely be attacked and possibly murdered in cold blood by violent criminals? Or   You are OK with guns to a point, so you have a little .38spl revolver. It has decent firepower for close range self defense situations, but only holds 5 rounds. In your adrenaline stricken panic, you fire off all five rounds but miss every attacker, only 4 run away...now you still have a large number of them who know you have no other means of self defense because they can see you trying to reload. They come into your home, brutally attack you and take all of your supplies/belongings...maybe they kill you and your kids, maybe they don't   Or   You are a firearm advocate and understand the risks that exist in every day life and that emergencies can happen so you purchased an AR15 and trained with it regularly. You have a few 30 round magazines handy so you know you have more than enough ammo to ride out the storm until the national guard shows up. The attackers come towards you but see your rifle, it is substantially more intimidating than a little pistol so a few run away....the remaining try their luck and advance towards you so you shoot a few rounds. Two of them hit the chest of one of the attackers because you knew how to handle your firearm properly. His buddies all scatter because they have seen that you are capable of defending yourself and it isn't worth their lives to attack you.   Your family lives to see another day because you were prepared for anything.   Emergencies happen, life is chaotic. Gun owners don't want violence, the last thing any of us want to do is to have to shoot someone and possibly take another life. We aren't violent criminals, we just accept the reality of the world and want to be able to protect ourselves and the people around us. I know that if I saw someone being robbed in the parking lot at gun point, I would rush to help them even if they were the most anti-gun lunatic in the world. Most of us would.

I'm a refugee from 4chan's /tv/ board. Despite being a forum specifically for movies and TV shows, the Game of Thrones threads are dominated by book readers who are not only inconsiderate to people who only watch the show, but are outright hostile to them. And they too are quick to judge people who have read the books, but haven't a scholarly insight to every minute detail. Despite this, they're even worse at shitposting and meme spamming than r/gameofthrones. Voice your objection to any of that, and you'll be met with angry several posts instructing you to *"fuck off back to Reddit!"* So I decided to finally take them up on it, and I regret not doing so years ago.
Cooool, I saw something that looked just like this the other day and had no idea what it was. Now I have some idea.

Realistically he came over from EU for a shot at S4 worlds. The way this split is looking C9 will probably clinch the top spot with DIG/CLG/LMQ in contention for the second worlds spot. TSM will most likely not make worlds unless they drastically improve.

5%, 12%, 70%. These values are relevant by weight. There is no conversion to make them mean the same thing. Ask someone in the Chemical Industry you trust. I am not going to try to convince you about anything but which is strongest. The mistake people make is they think the gallon is the unit of measurement...it is not and if it was it would be considerably stronger...By 40 something % if Im not mistaken. These chemicals will not last 8 hours in the sun on a pool deck or in a work truck. Seek the truth and you will find it.

Couldn't agree more with this post.  Bjergsen is young AND a competitor.  Taking it personal makes him hungry, so long as he isn't consumed by bitterness alone, which I don't think he will.  I mean come on, the guy still tries his hardest to recognize every sub that subscribes to him and explain moves.  How many big name streamers do that?  That says a lot about his character.

While I do think the Vikings played an awful game (2 INTs, 4 fumbles) and that you can't win turning the ball over THAT much, I still do think Sean Payton and Gregg Williams are scumbags for targeting Brett Favre that game.

Mario Kart 8 is the only red case and it's just meant to match with the red sort of theme that Mario/Mario Kart 8 has really but ultimately stands out with the other boxes. I believe the Luigi DLC physical copy has a green box. 
I still don't follow. Either my brain isn't working or I've had way too much sweet tea vodka and lemonade.  Those two could be related, but still...  I think you meant "there's still a chance", but "regardless of spot" is throwing me off.  Spot is the point of the contest!

The guidelines are the same in WA as they are at the federal level.  The issue here is that in the case of the orchardist he doesn't own a trailer, so it goes by GVWR plus the actual trailer+cargo weight.  He will generally load his bins two high and six deep on the flatbed trailer, and each bin comes in between 600-800 lbs.  His total combination weight is under 13 tons and this means he doesn't need a CDL under federal law.  If you follow [this](http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/cdlrequired.html) chart, his answers would be yes, yes, no...

That's a rather pointless post.
The whole point of a FAQ document is to note that a question gets asked a lot, *and then answer it*. But this FAQ contains no answers. This FAQ simply links to a vast number of instances of the question - many of which doubtless contain bitching about people not reading the FAQ - but nobody has bothered to boil down any or all of those discussions into a succinct answer.   Until someone does, we'll regularly see people find the FAQ bloody useless and ask this question again, inspiring yet more rounds of pointless bitching about not reading the FAQ. Are you not entertained?!

Battle just needs arenas.  There been a lot of people pissed about this.  Hopefully we'll get a dlc.  It almost seems like they didn't have time and were just like fuck it, just use the regular tracks for battle mode.

It's not hardcoded. Very little is hardcoded - that's why each expansion can have new campaign and battle maps, building, tech trees, etc... The issue is, we don't understand all the custom file formats for them. However, I've got no doubt they are working on modding tools for campaign etc, considering they have already made the assembly kit beta and their workflow with new maps every few months seems so productive.
There are a few people in my program that have taken visiting instructor/instructor positions at nearby universities but they are all writing their dissertations, research complete. Having seen how time consuming it is (I think all but one are doing 2+2) I can't imagine trying to do that, research at School B, and work on a proposal/conduct dissertation research.  I can't really make a suggestion toward your second or third options and I think this is something you need to discuss with your advisor at School A, but I think the first option should be considered very hard if not outright eliminated.

You want Doom, Quake, the old Wolfenstein.  Id Software, the original developers of Wolfenstein 3D, were masters at this.  Brutal Doom is still my favorite mod of all time.  The Quake games are some of the most influential games around.  Brutal Doom is probably your best bet, as I fire that game up every now and then just to take off some anger.
Consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy, so no. The idea of bodily autonomy and being held liable for child support are massively different. You have to think of this in terms of equity not equality. No one can be stripped of bodily autonomy. If I came to you and said "give me your kidney, we're a match" you would have the option to consent to being an organ donor, or to reject that idea altogether. No one is going to strap you down and rip your kidney out because I said so, because bodily autonomy trumps that. I don't have the right to continue my life by using your body.  Even dead people still have bodily autonomy to that extent if they choose not to donate their organs.   In regards to men giving consent to the risk of an accidental pregnancy, I think that's fair only because ejaculation is a voluntary act, ovulating is involuntary. A woman has no control over whether or not she is ovulating, but a man does have control over ejaculation. Obviously situations can be argued on an individual basis, but at brass tacks it makes sense that a man would be held liable.  And everyone uses their body and mind to make a living, and they consent to doing that or else they wouldn't have a job. I don't even understand what you're trying to get at with that one lol.

Some things I wish Vulcan had. A passive. And on hit effects applied (possibly a smaller percent) from turrets. Or maybe make them only able to be damaged by AA (like amc hives) In this way late game they are not a joke that get one shot by anything that looks at them funny. Also why God  do we not have swivel turrets? Made a bit more sense when he had thumper and his steroid ult but now it's just annoying. Maybe if you target a God with backfire it swivels on them, in this way someone can't just side step them and destroy them

That's a very good point--the problem is, though, that when he said 'fuck winter law,' he couldn't walk. At first, I had assumed that that would happen whenever the mantle was suppressed, such as when he's got iron in him. Others have posted that it was more likely Mab (or even Winter itself) being pissy and making a point, which sounds a lot more likely.   So I guess we just don't know--if Mab was making a point, his back could well be healed. If she wasn't, his back could well still be broken.

Actually, they're mostly utterly incomprehensible to experienced players too.  We have "overviews" which are carefully set up to display different types of objects in space and various properties about those objects (friendly vs hostile, velocity, distance, etc).

I've been banking on them doing well ever since they got Zion and Shiptur. A lot of the casters talk about Dig in the previous two splits was focussed on their play style and deficiencies, but recently the casters (and others, including Monte) have given respect to Imaqtpie and Crumbz for being very good players. By bringing in Zion and Shiptur Dig hugely strengthened their line-up, and while strategy has always been Digs weak point they have been improving over time. Either way, I definitely am expecting big things from them, their wins seem more sustainable than those of last split (which largely came from over-investing in Imaqtpie as their sole carry).

You can't seriously declare staying calmer in an argument means you're not as committed to the subject as the other party as a 'fact'. Some people are calmer/more self controlled than others, it doesn't automatically mean that they care less about a given subject.  As to the rest of what you said, while you're correct in your points, nothing that you said actually showed the OPs points to be less factual, it just showed what was going on behind them. That doesn't make them less factual.
These subs are actually overrun by MRAs XD
Honestly I think they are planning on adding one. With the way the tutorial works it seems like the engine could easy handle it.   Here's to hoping.  But usually mobas don't really progress in story seeing as it is a strictly multiplayer game.
I'm not all that familiar with Douglas during TT season however Ramsey has some good stuff to offer if you decide to go there. If you're using buses then the number 3 bus can get you there and takes around 50 minutes each way. I believe the last one is at about midnight but during the day there is usually one every half hour.   BarLogo in Ramsey generally has a nice biker vibe to it at this time of year with live rock bands playing on Fridays/ Saturdays, you can find it in parliament street. However it has a relatively small amount of space inside and can fill up quite quickly.  You can generally find the pubs and bars quite easily in Ramsey simply by walking from one end of parliament street to the other, I'd suggest that you go where you like the look of.  The outback, Tahiko and the courthouse in Douglas are clubs if you're looking to dance and they generally have a good amount of bikers/ tourists/ locals in them during the TT, however you may have trouble having a chat from the music volume.  I'm not entirely sure of nightlife in Peel, however if you're there for the day you can always visit Peel castle or the House of Mannanan, these give a good insight into Manx history and folklore if you're interested in that.   That's all I can think of right now, hope it helps! Have a good TT and don't be afraid to ask questions if you have any.

This reminded me of how some months ago my friend saved my life. We were using the crosswalk and it said it was ok for us to cross. I was just kind of focusing on getting to the other side when the timer started counting down. Cool, 15 seconds to walk about 5 yards. Next thing I know my friend grabs my arm really hard and yanks me back as a truck that was making a left turn passed by us at full speed. It wasn't a pickup truck- it was like one of those vehicles that carry dirt places.   I don't know how that guy could have possibly thought making a left was a good idea when there were people crossing. Had my friend not been paying attention I know for a fact I would have taken another step and been hit by a fucking truck. 
Can you imagine a world in which everyone took this to heart and let it define them as a person? We'd be so screwed.

Was testing myself, and trying to learn digital painting, so I wanted to go for detail both in the weapon and the skin. I'm not a fan of asiimov myself, and would have preferred, as you say, to do a more minimalistic skin, but I felt like this was necessary to properly push my limits as of now.
It seems like you already have.  Take that next to last paragraph or so of text and go back, fix up anything you want worded differently.  Slip it onto their desk in an envelope, give it to them in person.  Slip it under the teacher lounge's door during lunch, take your pick.  Just make sure that you address it to them, so that they know it's OK to open.  =)  It's also perfectly cool for you to stop after class and just your teacher know, "Hey, I appreciate what you've done for us this semester.  Thanks for what you do!"  It goes a long way, also.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Greywater Watch Household Guard and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

If the "coercion" is actually them just getting you into the mood, so that your answer goes from "no" to "YES!" then obviously that's not rape. (Probably not a good idea for someone to *try* to do this, though.)  If the coercion is them forcing you, manipulating you, or wearing you down, that is rape.

Just to add. I am assuming this is aluminum because its a higher end road bike. Steel can be dented (in the right places) and be fine for a decade. Aluminum has no stress limit (someone help me on the word) where even small impact will deform the frame over time. Titanium and steel have a limit where any stress or impact under that limit will never deform the bike. It could take a million small taps on the frame and they will never affect it. You can hit aluminum with a spoon a million times and shape that frame however you want. 
At this point, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. I've thrown a little over a grand into this game and I'm seriously regretting it.

what is love?
oh my oh my. Yes... a lot has changed. 
Wrath is very controversial because it was a drastic turning point in the game's history. It made everything a ton more accessible at the cost of sacrifing a lot of challenge.   It really was a love it or hate it expansion, and while I'm in the latter category I definitely see why some people loved it, suddenly they got to do a whole lot of stuff that wasn't possible for them before. It kind of hit us people who were already doing that stuff though, aside from Ulduar hardmodes the only challenge I ever found was HC Putricide, HC Sindragosa and HC LK, so in general I only really enjoyed Ulduar, while EoE at least had one great battle too.  The theme also seemed to go well with the general audience, especially since The Lich King is such a recognizable figure. I was personally very dissapointed in the lore, but once again I can see why it was just cool for some people to simply battle this high profile character that they had waited so many years to face.  Because of this I wouldn't call Wrath the peak of WoW, because it was very divided, and a lot of controversy and complaints were present in the community in its days because of this, and the community is obviously a big part of the game. But of course that's just my take on it.
Now this may be the first reaction but it shows that you really don't understand the whole situation.  Put yourself in his shoes for a second. You're a 24 year old from the slums of India and you're approached and offered a job that pays more than you would likely ever see in your lifetime otherwise. Its easy for us to say we wouldn't poach a rhino but for this boy the payday he'd get would change his life forever. For that reason it doesn't matter how many poachers are killed because for every poacher like him killed there are thousands to millions of other people who will take his place.  The poachers are not the problem, its the buyers. In my opinion the trade of rhino horns should be legalized. A rhino horn is like a fingernail, it constantly grows throughout their lifetime and can easily be harvested. A legalized trade would eliminate all the problems with poachers because the price of a horn would plummet as the stockpiles of legally dehorned rhino horns hit the market. Thus there would be no need to kill a rhino for its horn and the entire problem would be solved.  Source: First hand experience working with and dehorning rhinos in South Africa.

"Yes there are." There are kind of contradictory policies. It comes down to how much it seems the song is reliant on the sample, I guess. Even if it's a short sample, if it's looped and everything is clearly built around it the creator can still be forced to pay citation fees. However, even if the sample is long and obvious, if it highly altered it can skip over most claims. A good example of this is SebastiAn's Kindercut. Most of the sounds in that song come from Sneaky Sound System's UFO, but, to my understanding, he did not have to pay anything to them because they denied him the right to call it a remix. (Most of this info is on a few cases I've seen and music being released. I've read a few of the formal laws about it but definitely not enough.)  Underground/Free releases kind of get around these issues a lot, too.   It really comes down to how famous you are. The Beastie Boys were probably big enough that they likely had someone do that work for them, allowing them to create whatever they liked.

Oh, my mistake. I dunno, I've been doing background work for years and have always heard of people with minor speaking roles such as this still being referred to as background and they still sit with us in background holding.

&gt; We execute criminals now don't we? I consider it perfectly just to execute murderers and what not. I'd also argue that prison is torture, yet we see it is perfectly just to send people there.  I find the imprisonment of individuals to be a necessary evil since we have nothing better to do with them at the moment. I also find executions to be wrong. While prison may be a form of torture, it is not the agonizing pain of hell fire as described in the bible. That would be cruel and unusual and be against our constitution.  &gt; As I said before, I believe in free will so we do make morally important decisions.  I'm a borderline compatibalist, so I think we make some form of decisions, but our beliefs are definitely not one of them. You can be convinced of something, but you can no more control your beliefs than you can control what food you like. Sure it CAN change, but it's because you are convinced, not because you made a choice to change your beliefs. Don't believe me? Choose to stop believing in God. You can't, because no matter how hard you try, believing in God is just something you personally do at this stage of your life.  &gt;  in fact, they are compliments, working together to produce a good world.  My point is that with each individual you must make a choice between being merciful or just. Sure God can choose to be merciful with one person and choose to be just with another, but the moment you start granting someone mercy, you are forgoing the justice that they "deserve." I am okay with this concept, but mercy should be equally granted for the same acts and not based upon a belief you don't choose.
It has absolutely nothing to do with MBTs, but with the whopping 7 minutes timer that locks the central lane.   Miller vs Mattherson, equal numbers, Mattherson attacks Freyr, Miller attacks Eisa, in the end Mattherson has both. What went wrong? Oh for sure not those 7 minutes that let you take another base then redeploy back to clean up. Rinse and repeat, once base at a time. It's really not complicated once you give up that strange idea to push all 3 lanes at once with evenly split forces.
Thanks for telling me, Ill make a repost 
That would be fantastic. Thanks!

Yeah, I know. Wasn't that the pretty woman case?   At any rate, copyright law is an option per the US Constitution; it's obviously therefore not an inalienable right, as it can be revoked on the whim of Congress, or rather their constituents.   I like to look at it as if the public's rights and freedoms were something tangible, like a bed for example, off the top of my head. Copyright law would be the blanket that covers the bed that was added after the fact. Fair use would be that space down at the end of the bed where the blanket doesn't quite reach, and so your toes poke out. It doesn't cover it, and the basic principles remain even with the existence of the blanket/law. Fair use is the right to use content regardless of copyright law, and fair use will exist even if copyright was repealed tomorrow. The reverse however is not true.   I understand what you're saying all the same, however. Such is the problem with a precedential legal system. One bad decision, followed by another and another all based off of the first, can skew things into something unrecognizable. 
it's his job.

With that said, In a perfect world it would be irrelevent... but like I say to anyone who say things such as "why do woman have to watch their surroundings while out drinking and not just put more focus on teaching men not to be pigs?". I tell them that even if every single person ever was taught the rights from wrongs that there are still going to be people who do wrong... there for we have to take some precautions or else unfortunately we would actually be denying that bad things can happen to all of us.

I am aware of the problem and the endless loading screen. When you are right on top of them on the minimap it still shows you that they are beneath you even though that should be impossible.  The solution is to delete ALL spawn points when it happens, usually at the BEGINNING of the creation. Under the menu "Placement" choose the "Delete Options" submenu and then "Delete all spawn points". I cant remember the exact wording but something like that.  This deletes the broken ones (aswell as your own already placed). It is sadly the only way to delete the broken ones since you cant physically see them. You should then be able to place new ones after that without this bug happening again in THIS creation.  I myself first tried to recreate the DM but the bug kept happening. This was the only solution I could come up with, and it worked for me.

And then the straight metal bars would go into the upper part of the keyboard plastic supports.  I think the central metal bar is just to keep it level even when pressed from one side.   I could be completely wrong, but at first glance, that's what I see.
Thanks obama!
