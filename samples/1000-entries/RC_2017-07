If you ask the refugees that came over here they would tell you they rather live in their own native countries and would return asap if things settled down.

Exactly this.  The military aren't just going to let anyone buy a rail gun.  You'd likely have three avenues of acquiring one: from a derelict Idris that you can salvage an undamaged part from, from the UEE or from a very high end illegal arms dealer.
What makes the Thrunite better besides the 1100 lumens? I'm not guru and am generally curious why it is recommended here more by most people?
I logged 600 hrs on this game and haven't played since 2.2. Maybe other games are more fun or I don't have as much time but these new posts do make me feel nostalgic for the first 20-50 hrs of the game. 
It means that O2 doesn't end up stunned in a lot of WCs that I do. Maybe he does and I just don't notice, but I'm pretty sure he does not end up stunned for the majority of the fight. I'm autistic, not blind. 
Being high on weed honestly made it super worse for me. Maybe like x2. But the nice thing was that I didn't give a shit.

I'm currently vaping on a new flavor I picked up recently, Electric Forest by Vapejoose and it's pretty tasty.  Monkey Nuts sounds pretty good, I'll have to pick up some of that to try sometime.

Is gnostic a-fairyism hypocritical?   I say I "know" that there are no gods with the same degree of certainty and for all the same reasons that I saw I "know" there are no goblins, pixies, elves or giants. And I doubt anyone would fault me for saying that I "know" none of those things exist.   God claims are indistinguishable from these claims in every meaningful aspect. The only reason we try and brand gnostic atheism as an untenable position is because of the cultural conditioning attached to religious beliefs, and the undeserved pedestal that religion gets; often, even from believers. Neither religion, nor religious thought, involves any deeper thinking or more justification than the belief in hobgoblins, once you peel away all the woo and deepisms. Why, then, is it somehow wrong for me to say that I "know" no gods exist? &gt;it doesn't make sense to claim god doesn't exist when we have no real evidence against god either.   The fact that every single god ever posited is evidently a man-made construct **is** evidence against gods.
Thanks! I'll do some hunting this weekend. 
The new replacement should allow you to use the LGS with out any issues? I just turn all RGBs off for battery life.
Hi :)  I went to the chemistry/pharmacy to get medications for mine near the ankle =_=' (the girl working there is even a nurse and can do the service) You could  go to the gp! If it's an ingrown hair they just need to gently dig a way out for that hair that went bananas.  Have you already disinfected it anyway?

That you for pointing this out. I can't seem to find anything from /u/possiblywrong would you mind walking me through how you did it?
Yeah, now that I'm looking at it again, I see a zombie in that area with the more shallow water.
I thought this was a ballsy post on a non-throwaway until i was proven wrong. Nice one.
I feel like Deshaan is underrated, the main questline in Deshaan is very well structured and engaging, and has a satisfying length to it with an epic showdown with the antagonist of the zone. I find that the Ebonheart pact has some of the best and worst zones in the game. Best being (in my opinion): Stonefalls and Deshaan, but also the worst in (in my opinion): Eastmarch and The Rift. The Dunmer pact zones are absolutely stunning visual wise and The Rift as lackluster as it is has a beautiful autumn theme. Shadowfen is a swamp and is "meh" visual wise, the Argonian architecture however does provide a unique flavor.   The Dominion is very floral and elegant when it comes to the cherry blossom covered Auridon and Altmer architecture adds loads of character to its settlements. Grahtwood is captivating with its sprawling gigantic trees, and there is tons to do in the zone, but the mystical "big trees everywhere" motif wore off in a hasty fashion, and I just got sick off it. Greenshade is very savanna like and offers a slightly modified flavor, and has much better quests than Grahtwood, but still similar enough to Grahtwood to leave me yearning for differents visuals. Malabal Tor just made me sick to my stomach, it's a swampy Grahtwood essentially and I was just ready to vomit at the sight of another fucking tree, the quests are good, but the visuals are the damned same, leaving this zone wanting. Reaper's March was a breath of fresh air where we finally get some Khajiit flavor (this was great especially when we had 3 Bosmer zones in a row). Reaper's March had great quests and the previously mentioned Khajiit flavor was refreshing.   The Daggerfall Covenant is a mixed bag, Glenumbra is painfully bland, unimaginative, and generic, and the lackluster quests didn't help one bit. Stormhaven was okay, a step above Glenumbra, and Wayrest is beautiful, but still no where near the best, quests didn't feel that engaging. Rivenspire is amazing. The withered crag visual was executed very well, and the quests are okay as well. The Alik'r Desert is nice Redguard flavor, and the Yokudan structures are majestic to say the least, quests were nice. Bangkorai is an interesting combination of Breton and Redguard geography, nice area.   Overall, I feel like Ebonheart Pact is the strongest, followed by The Covenant, then the Dominion (the Dominion would definitely stomp the covenant if it wasn't for the fact that the zones would have you believe the Dominion is a Bosmer only organization)

Hi! The only trustworthy way to secure a place to stay from your country (or even from here, why not?) is to do it through online housing agencies. They cost you a fee, but considering the the living costs of the city you save up money in the long run.   Hostingpower and spotahome are two examples. They are both legit. However, the former only offers accomodation solutions in houses that owner occupied, the latter instead has both owner and non-owner occupied houses (mostly the second).   Hostingpower is great for students as most of the houses are around the universities, but, again, you would need to be OK with not living in a students house where you party and stuff like that. I am actually living in a house booked through this service right now, and I am liking it. I pay 480 for a single room with double bed, and I am 40 mins walk from the center. (they offer only single rooms and an all inclusive formula with expenses and wifi, and bed linen included).  Seems like an advertisement, but I feel you and it's really not worth it to get involved in the crazyness of househunting in dublin! it is not worth it and plus you waste a lot of money in hostels. I heard you could go on for months.  Just so you know, you only have to give one week notice with hostingpower, so if at some point you find your dreamhouse you can always leave. No deposit and payments are on a weekly basis.  Source: my experience of househunting from abroad

&gt; So, how did someone get access to your userid, password AND computer?  You're really overthinking this.  If they weren't at his computer, they'd normally just get asked an extra security question, nothing more.  If they already had his username and password, it's not a big stretch to assume they knew the answer to whatever measley security questions the bank uses.

I deffo think it's possible to raise it up in two months but its moreso about the effort you know. Time the time to make sure you have important concepts in chem/phys down.

Lol dude what's the worst that can happen. A girl says no?   I've had girls laugh in my face and they weren't even that pretty and i've had hot chicks naked on the first date.   Rejection happens. Don't try to force asking every girl you talk to out.   Let the asking out come natural. Start conversation if it goes well ask her out. If it stays mostly friendly say you're goodbye and head out. 
Thank you very much. I can sometimes be shy (yes, even online) and scared to put myself out there. The tough part is breaking past that reservation and letting that shiny personality break through
The only apple product I have is an ipad but every single thing I've tried to use it for has been a pain in the ass.  Why the fuck do I have to install itunes just to get media files loaded onto it so that the app that recognizes them will actually open them. I guess if all you want is to use shit that's built into apple's ecosystem it works but otherwise it is certainly not easy to use.  To get things on my android phone I don't even have to plug it into my computer I can just copy them over the network into whatever directory I want and open them straight way.

 Now that he has retired, Pope Benedict can finally devote time to his true passion: **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona**.

I do wish the newspapers hadn&amp;apos;t mentioned **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona** in grandpa&amp;apos;s obituary.  I got pulled over the other day because **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona** Apparently, that&amp;apos;s a crime.  I drink to forget **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona**.  Life for American Indians was forever changed when the White Man introduced them to **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona**.  TSA guidelines now prohibit **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona** on airplanes  To prepare for his upcoming role, Daniel Day-Lewis immersed himself in the world of **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona**.  WHOOO! God damn I love **standing on the corner in Winslow, Arizona**!
I made a similar trade, so I'm all for this. In dynasty, I think we overplay the "how long will X player for" when we have zero clue how long someone will play for. If you get two years out of Brees/MT, it's completely worth it.

My special guy has a bunch of big tattoos. They look awesome on him. They just fit. He's Kiwi, though, so it's partly a cultural thing and also it just goes with his his wild, idgaf personality.   His tattoos would look like crap on a different guy. They just wouldn't be right. He's big, muscular and fit, and has a certain way of carrying himself.   Put another way, I don't like or dislike tattoos, but I can love them because they express the personality of a person I love.

Wrong. Game 1: 12 points, 6 assists, 40% shooting, -7 +/- and Isaiah Thomas torched him.  He upped his game from terrible to mediocre, and people here tried to throw a parade for him. Truly baffling. The bench (specifically Bobby Portis) ended up being the difference.  Rondo's Game 2 was great, though. Best game he's played in three years, so expect another game like that in 2020, unless he starts playing overseas before then. 
It's worth noting that the reflect damage on PBE Thornmail is 25 + 10% bonus armor, a considerable step down from 15% of incoming damage + 25% bonus armor.
It's true, Allo's "incognito mode" is E2EE, but so is the "[secret conversation](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/1084673321594605/)" mode in Facebook Messenger. They are both optional, so I assume the authors would have put Allo on the same level as Facebook Messenger. Probably to the left, though, because Allo is based on phone numbers...

I was surprised too. He's got to have amazing genes to be as active as he is at this age.   Edit: I am a little shocked at the reaction to such a simple comment. My wife has a hereditary immune disorder and will be very lucky if she's able to reach 60. She's already oxygen and a daily medicine regimen that would make even the worst pill-head shocked. My niece has CF and the outlook is not favorable for her either. Genes play an important role in how active and healthy you can be.

I didn't say anything about it not having a palpable impact - it's the leading traffic driver to our website and my work in the field on certain platforms is often cited in case studies and best practices - just that the people they continue to hiring in C-level positions (I'm now a director with a team of reports who manage various digital channels) never seem to fully grasp its true value and can only view things through the lens of sales and revenue. Sure, a lot of that comes back to pressure from the board, but I swear to god they have amnesia some days.
If its all a joke to keep it under wraps, I hope as hell Hardy's casting was for real and he was casted for the sequel. I mean the sequel starts filming next April/May, but the early casting announcement could be to make the Venom movie look real.  Its all a stretch but I really hope what you said its true.

I second this. I'm 19, and about a year ago I was driving home from work at noon with my little brother in the passenger seat. I was two weeks, to the day, fresh on my license.   We were on a detour through a small town, and we were going the speed limit, following about a length and a half behind. My brother starts to say something, and I glance over, like you do, and somehow in that half a second the woman in front of me manages to slam on her brakes (with no turn signal) to turn into her driveway. I look up and slam on the brakes, but it was too late, and the next thing I knew my head hit the airbag. (For those of you who haven't been airbagged, it's like getting punched by a bag of air that feels like a bag of concrete going 35 MPH.)   I totaled my car, and even though she's the one who caused the accident, I got the ticket because I hit her. I couldn't drive for weeks afterward, and when I did it was so so so scary. But in a way, I'm glad it happened the way it did, because we only lost the car. If we hadn't been wearing seatbelts, we would have lost our lives.   Wear your seatbelts, kids. 
Thanks :)

That's because you don't understand biology. Eggs are in a state of stasis, and while specific problems like lack of chromosome separation can occur on older eggs, the genetic information isn't being written over and over again. When cells divide many many times, like they do to make sperm, each division carries a risk of mutation. The machinery that ensures copy fidelity also become less efficient as men age. So, your gamete producing cells have been dividing since sperm production began, the more divisions the more mutations. Old sperm is worse than old eggs.

I knew some fucking idiots there. I still work with plenty of said idiots. I am likely one of the idiots.  I went to civilian schools before attending USAFA and I honestly don't think it's more academically demanding than the other schools I went to. It's tougher because you have competing priorities and can't devote as much time to academics, but actual core course content was no tougher than what I had elsewhere. 
I have no genetic physical illness thus it does not apply to me. Also considering I don't plan on imposing it on currently living people. Perhaps you need to be weeded out 
Perhaps Broughy or someone from NoDo has a video to show it, but it is a fact. The topmost spoiler option doesn't add traction (regardless of how it looks), all other options do (same ‚Äî so a "no spoiler" option down the list actually adds traction).  If you like your car with the default spoiler option, just go with it. Unless your main goal is to win races, chances are it won't make much of a difference.

Which is what kept Hulk off the squad, he would just eat the ball or kill someone and get a flagrant 2.   I just went with Blob because I felt he would out rebound Beast, and would be able to shut down half the paint to what I awesome would be another speedster as the opposing PG.  You could also consider someone like Antman or Doctor Manhattan as they would be able out reach the blob on rebounds, but no one besides Juggernaut could move the blob in the paint.

&gt;  you cannot argue that it's not holding Firefox back  Let's try ;)  Mozilla *chooses* to let add-ons hold them back. Lots of large add-on developers have to deal with breakage all the time, and do so just fine. Add-ons like Tab Groups, Tab Mix Plus, Classic Theme Restorer and others succeed in staying up-to-date with Nightly even. My guess is that for most add-ons that are not huge (so I'm not talking about something like Pentadactyl), developers are able to keep up with at least the beta release, even *without* Mozilla trying not to break them. If at some point a developer decides that he doesn't want to deal with it anymore, he can port his add-on to WebExtensions. If this is not possible, the add-on would be lost anyway. The status quo of this is losing fewer add-ons than what will happen now in Fx 57, and giving other developers who aim to port to WEs, but might not make it, more time to do so.  Sure, this might be a little annoying for people who are using unmaintained add-ons already, if they're only working because Mozilla puts effort in not breaking compatibility. But losing some of your legacy add-ons still seems better to me than losing all of them.

Could you explain a little more for me , I'm in at .00350 (not much money ) still learning .   Should i just cut my 5 percent loss now , or hold ? I'm trying to learn how to day trade.  I've noticed a 35BTC ASK wall be put up which seems to prevent the momentum from going up .. every time it hits that wall you see people buying even above the wall and the price acts VERY strangely (people buying higher then the ask price )   Thanks !

Ya I don't think he would ever purposely go after the gay community, but if Pence, Sessions, Bannon, or some close person with clout gave him a chance at something he wanted and LGBTQ people got fucked in the side wash of it he would agree in a heartbeat. *Not my voters, why should I care.*

Likes or dislikes are a somewhat arbitrary release of pleasure when you achieve certain outcomes that align with your goals and value structures.   You like food because it aligns with the goal of surviving.   You like TV because it entertains the mind, which you have because it helps you pass on your DNA if you happen to enjoy life.   As for specifically what food and TV you like, it gets more specific and subjective. And yes, philosophers like Mill or Hume I think have discussed for example, what is the greater pleasure: a man or a pig.   For practicality, I think recognizing what you like and dislike in a more objective manner suffices enough. Instead of letting it control and pull you around, you use it as you please.

There are many things.  Here are a few:  * allow medicare and Medicaid to negotiate the prices of medicines and medical equipment. * forbid collusion between insurance companies on pricing.  If I understand correctly, there's an exemption in the anti-trust laws for insurance.  * go to a single non-profit *payer* (not single *provider*) model.  Medical providers spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with insurance companies.   There are many others.

I wouldn't afk level gathering.  The exp is really bad. Filter some of your water, get some pickaxes and head out to pilgrim's haven and grab some rough stone.  Don't sell the rough stone as you'll need it for numerous things in the game (making cooking/alchemy stations/repairing fort in node war) but it gives you the best gathering XP and it only gets better as your level goes up.  With processing you can powerlevel with flax.  Not really worth too much processed so it's better if you invest in the nodes and have your workers gather what you process.  It gives unusually high XP.  When you hit Prof 10 is when I'd start processing other things like wood/ore etc

I also LOVE the acoustic versions he does of some of the songs on there. Just makes me realize how amazing his songwriting is that he can break down the songs to just acoustic and vocals and still retain so much of the song.  And Queen of California has recently become an absolute favorite song (especially the Crossroads performance), I listen to it 2-3 times a day!  Totally agreed on Walt Grave live. Saw it in KC and it was a beautiful experience. It's also one of those songs that I discuss the meaning with friends all the time. Love Chris Botti's part in the studio intro too
I always figured Thassarian was primarily frost focused because of the duel wield talent back in the day.
Man, too true. We hired on a new cleaning company to clean our house last week. The guy comes over before the first cleaning to do a walk through. I'm a decent judge of character, and right away I could tell this guy was good-to-go, and I hired him on the spot.   Fast forward to last Monday.. he shows up just before 7:00am, and is trying to find a place to park in the neighborhood (we live in a small square block - think houses around the square's perimeter and houses on the inside, with a single street), so he had to circle through the neighborhood a couple of times. He finally decided to park a house down from us at the curb. As he is unloading his truck a cop shows up. Said a neighbor called them about a suspicious person "casing" the neighborhood.   I was so embarrassed I told the guy to come back another day, and paid him extra.  It's not even like it's an all white hood. It's upper middle class, and several ethnic families live here.   I was honestly very surprised and disappointed with my neighbors.

Pickup trucks pretty much HAVE to be rear wheel drive. There's very little weight in the back of an empty pickup, even with rear-wheel drive. So if you removed the (heavy) drive shaft and rear differential required for rear wheel drive, you'd be left with pretty much no weight whatsoever back there. So when the pickup bed is empty, there would be no weight to keep the rear wheels pushed down to the ground. All the weight would be in the front of the truck from the engine. So when you drove, the slightest bump would cause the rear of the truck to bounce all over the road and you'd have very little control over the vehicle.   The other problem is that when you load up the truck bed with heavy stuff (think construction materials) you weigh down the rear axle and "lift weight" off the front axle. So, if you had a heavy load in a front-wheel-drive pickup truck, you could find yourself in a situation where you'd have a tough time getting traction from the front wheels.

I am not sure that terf should be claimed to be an insult,  or maybe as an insult alone.

I was a kid in the 1970s and Happy Days was for a couple of years the number 1 highest rated show on TV here in Australia, but our parents never watched that channel so I didn't know what Happy Days was and couldn't figure out why kids went around with their thumbs up going 'Heeeey!'  Later on I did get to see it as it was repeated endlessly. It wasn't that funny but some of the characters like Fonzie, Ritchie, Joanie, Chachi were considered cute or cool so the show had its fans. There was an episode where Fonzie did water-ski over a shark. It was a silliest scene in a show where there were many silly scenes, but being one scene didn't affect the series long term (after that story was over the show continued just as it had before.)  What really did weaken the show was the cast departures. The loss of Ritchie was the worst, and the season without Chachi and Joanie was particularly thin.
More CUs does not always = more power because you can balance how much power each CU gets. You can make a 16 CU GPU use more power than a 24 CU GPU. 
Living paycheck to paycheck, without any actual security (i.e. living on reduced spending but knowing that you do actually have money for when shit goes wrong)  Not for a long time, but just long enough to make them learn to empathize with people who don't have much.

There is. Contempt of court isn't a crime so there is nothing to be pardoned. My understand is the judge just sends you to jail until you are willing to talk. In that case, no pardon could save him because he hasn't committed a crime or been sentenced to anything.

Thanks, you're a nice person to not shame me over saying the wrong name. I didn't know that Pope Benedict was in the Hitler youth. I can remember reading lots of things about the 2nd world war though, and how normal Germans were scared of the Nazi regime and that one shopkeeper wife was asked 'how is business?' and she scoffed and said 'What business? We have no business!' and the Nazi's took her away the next night for having spoken out against them. She never came back. I guess what I'm saying is that I'd be inclined to go easier on people that made bad decisons back then. Especially if they were young, I'm still pretty shocked though. I can't imagine a person who was once a member of the Hitler Youth ever becoming Pope. I'm a bit surprised and confused to hear that.
That's one minority.

Neoteny is the manipulation of animal instincts so that breeders can continue passing on their genes. That's it. Every time a guy likes a girl for being cute or a woman likes a guy for being cute. Every time a woman goes "awww" when she sees a baby monkey or a kitten, it's just her animal instincts kicking in. These people are not seeing anything, objectively. They are just reacting to their breeder programming. Because without that programming, most babies and children wouldn't survive to adulthood. There is even a study that proves that the few babies who are unlucky enough to be born extremely ugly instead of cute, end up being abandoned or treated like shit by their parents(often not surviving to adulthood) yet these same parents would have treated a cute baby like gold.

Looking at your questions, it's unclear whether your site will be focused on finding players for face-to-face games, for real-time online play including VTTs, for play-by-post, or all of them. Since AFAIK players tend to treat face-to-face and online quite differently, maybe that confusion is contributing to your poor reception.
provide evidence.
maybe its the fact that there "is" a sale?
When you're the same temperature as the air around you, that means the air around you isn't wicking away your excess heat, so your temperature rises putting you at risk of heat stroke. All you can do is sweat the excess heat off but that's much less efficient.

This isn't a discussion about women's happiness anyways it's about mens mental health something I'm extremely passionate about given my own issues with mental health. I was just giving my theories on the situation.   Men are not needed by society anymore because one of the primary things they provided (financial support) is either taken from them via the courts or women just make their own money and don't need men to provide for them.  
His motivator boost is very noticeable. Whole offense blocks better. But, they kinda robbed him as a rb. He's ok, not spectacular. They made him an elusive back that can't really truck (which is some infuriating bullshit) but he stiff arms like a madman and can squeeze through the tackles pretty well

Absolutely! Best to just get out of the snake's away as fast as possible. Sticking around to 'defend' yourself is nonsense. Leave the poor snake to its business and it won't mess with you.  I've never heard of a rattlesnake chasing anyone down to kill, but dear lord that would be terrifying. I'd skip the gun and just pack a flamethrower if that were the case.

The first series was good with the whole ancient Egypt thing. GX was fine but started to get a little repetitive but it was still entertaining. 5Ds was great IMO. And then it got insane.

Cannot recommend Marvel Unlimited enough! Especially if you want the full experience for your 1-700 journey. And as /u/Mc_Spider_02 said the side issues are awesome and marvel unlimited is usually pretty good about having those in que after you read an issue. Some events are followed in different issues. Example would be when a big spidey event would happen you would have to read a issue from amazing, spectacular, and Web to follow the story line in order.
No way! That was awesome, even on the receiving end.

I am a dude, yes, but it's nothing so complicated as that, I just misread the post because I'm a dumbass haha
&gt; I'm agreeing with the guy saying that Drake can be called the Jay of this generation because they're both moguls. Yes, that's what I'm categorically disagreeing with. First, Drake isn't anywhere near the mogul Jay was/is. Secondly, Jay isn't Jay because of the number of records sold. He's Jay because of the bars, the charisma, the classic albums, the personality, the business, man. Jay and Drake generally don't even rap about the same shit. Jay a born hustler who came from the mud. Drake is a child TV star. Jay grew up in the Marcy projects while Drake came up in Canada. There's no criterion by which Drake is the new Jay Z. Didn't even include the fact Jay is just by far the better musician. Like, it's not even close.
You are walking or at least being wheeled around so it is moving all over the place. 
Yep. I guess I'm abusing that people don't have a player history of me, therefore they assume I'm the average player, and therefore that my range will be balanced there by 99-AA. But really I only do that with Aces and maybe Kings.

&gt; Wir sind zu lieb  und - schande - wir (als eltern) sind es wohl "schuld". wenn man als kind zur "gepr√ºgelten generation" geh√∂rt, will man nicht, da√ü die eigenen kids das auch noch erleben - und √ºbertreibt es ein bi√üchen mit der nettigkeit.  &gt; Erfolg wird gro√ü geschrieben.  aus der nummer bin ich jetzt dummerweise in vielerlei hinsicht komplett raus. ich bin ja nun wirklich der besagte "[60 years old hippie](https://imgur.com/a/uzggu)", f√ºr uns galt karriere als der personifizierte satan, was die gesellschaft von uns dachte, war uns ziemlich egal, wir haben unser eigenes ding gemacht, peace &amp; love, a punky reggae party ... scheiss auf die gesellschaft. ich kann also nicht wirklich die m√ºhle verstehen, in der du steckst. ich bin aber nicht so anma√üend zu sagen: "steig aus!" ([‚ÄûTurn on, Tune in, Drop out!‚Äú](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary)), wie frei oder unfrei du dein leben f√ºhrst, liegt in deiner verantwortung - von mir nur der hinweis, da√ü es alternativen gibt und man sich einer gesellschaft nicht anpassen muss.   das kann, wie in unserem falle, dazu f√ºhren, da√ü man der welt so etwas wie das internet und computer hinterl√§√üt, weil man frei genug im kopf war. die angepassten benutzen den kram heute ohne ihn zu verstehen.  da gilt auch f√ºr meine kids: ich erwarte nicht von ihnen, da√ü sie einen weg gehen, den ich mir f√ºr sie vorstelle und lasse die das mal selbst entscheiden. du hast da wahrscheinlich andere erfahrungen gemacht und ich erz√§hle dir dies nur, damit du wei√üt: es geht auch ohne dieses √ºberfordern der kinder, weil man sie als die fortsetzung der eigenen existenz unter dem motto "es soll den kindern mal besser" mi√übraucht. ja will ich auch, aber was das ist, sollten sie besser slbst wissen - ich habe keinen plan oder rat.  &gt; geh studieren  meine drei t√∂chter tun das. alles m√∂gliche zwischen arch√§ologie, philosophie, kunstgeschichte. sie verstehen das als die zeit, die sie sich nehmen, bevor das leben sie zermalmt. ich verstehe es als die zeit, in der man die hingabe an ein thema lernt und wie man in die tiefe geht.  wenn man es macht, weil man karriere machen will, muss man mit den resultaten, die dieser wunsch erzeugt, leben.  &gt; In der muslimische Kultur finde ich ist es vor allem die fehlende Wissenschaftlichkeit oder der glaube an Wissenschaft  also, der gebildetste, liebensw√ºrdigste und sanfteste mensch in meinem leben war muslim. arbeitet heute als sterbebegleitender psychologe. muslim sein und gleichzeitig nach bildung und wissen zu streben, scheint sich nicht auszuschlie√üen ;)  &gt; Aber gut , dass sind jetzt meine Beobachtungen.   ich weiss nicht, ob meine anmerkungen hilfreich waren, oder verwirrend. vielleicht am besten so zusammengefasst: gib einen verdammten scheiss drauf, was andere von dir erwarten, es ist **dein leben**. mach, wonach dir der sinn steht und was dich mit sinn und gl√ºck erf√ºllt. lass die anderen reden, die m√ºssen dein leben nicht leben. h√∂r auf deine eigene innere stimme und geh ein wagnis ein.  oder pass dich an und bedauere am ende deiner tage, da√ü du es nicht getan hast. ich gucke auf meines, es ist einiges schiefgegangen, aber ... ich hatte mindestens vier oder f√ºnf leben und jedes einzelne macht mich zufrieden. es waren **meine** und ich habe nur mir selbst geh√∂rt.

I have been having a try of crash 2 this morning and while it's a little better I feel there is a distinct problem in engine perhaps, consistent flaws such as hitboxes and slippery controls (also what the fuck is with the ice levels? Do I have rockets on my shoes? When I slide that's the only way to control on ice). Some things I personally find shouldn't have gotten through play tests.
Thats just a bug in the shooting range, not in actual games.

I do not support brexit but from " brexit means brexit" and "no deal is better than bad deal" I suspected hard brexit it is. "Strong and stable" convinced me that May has nothing, no plan no strategy and after GE that became even more obvious. Eu has plans without UK  and recent demands are just to make it harder for UK to change direction even if narrative in country might change. I hope I am wrong.  Edit: economy part? Elites care about power, not economy. Who cares about some poor peasant barely feeding family? As long there are no riots - fuck em.

I recommend a chat service for your website (instead) as the virtual chat agents are likely to get more information from your customers. For a telephone service maybe just use a selection service so the customer can choose the department they want to go :)  Check out Tawk.to - their chat is free and you can use it on your mobile - but they also have a virtual chat agent for $1 per hour (USD) https://www.tawk.to/hire-chat-agents-1hr/  I use Tawk.to for all my clients websites who want a chat service, it's perfect &amp; free!

Sir, those are panties. I'm going to have to insist that you use the word.
TL;DR: Because your body can no longer lose heat.  Heat moves from hot to cold. Heat is when molecules "vibrate" faster than others - the hotter molecules bang into colder ones and transfer some of their energy, just like smashing a cue ball into other balls on a pool table. Energy gets transferred and taken away from the cueball, just like energy from the warm molecules in your body gets taken away when you radiate heat.  Your body regulates its temperature by using sweat or radiating heat into colder air... but can't do either when it's too humid for sweat to evaporate, or when the air is as hot as your body. There's no slower molecules in the air for your body to lose the energy in its faster molecules.  So you can't automatically regulate the temperature of your body and your body knows this by letting you know "its really hot and unhealthy here, do something different, ok?" so it can restore its ability to regulate its temperature.
Sending strength and good vibes your way! You got this!
I said you'd have to be blind to not credit Melo for getting Denver to the playoffs and you said no doubt. That isn't very clear. You're also speaking complete nonsense if you say taking a team from 17-65 to 43-39 in your ROOKIE season isn't a big deal

&gt;We socialists must at all times study one-another, and remember that despite this difficult history amongst ourselves (which I am pessimistic about avoiding in the future), we strive for the same end goal. We are by nature comrades, and this is only invalidated at the point of aggression against ourselves, and this invalidation is to be made pointless in the end.  It's like you have substituted class analysis with some bizarre ideologies-analysis.
I see your point and want to genuinely apologize. I was indeed way out of line. No need to be a jerk to strangers, especially when talking about Disney stuff.

IKR Republicans even had to stoop so low as to not offend freaking white supremacists this election. Trump had to be forced to denounce David Duke :/ 
Actually, in theory, it is possible to see the actual dinosaurs in real time. If you were to go millions of light years away in an instant and have a huge, huge, huge fantastic telescope and looked back at earth, you'd see the earth as it looked millions of years ago, dinosaurs included.

lol dude is just acting elite, the truth is metas that are strip mine locking are not metas that are using bounce lands.  bounce lands have their own strength in that they are a great budget option and if played right, are better than most tapped lands.  There are a few exceptions of course, and yeah, if it gets blown up you're in some deep shit. But some one that would turn 2 strip mine a bounce land isn't some one I'd want playing in my meta.  If you're playing a competitive match, sure, but competitive matches and decks don't use bounce lands. So the scenario he presents is just too asinine to take seriously.

Played a very similar list to yours on Stream late last year, we dubbed it "Flick My Junk" because immature deck names are my jam.  Main different was a couple of the one-ofs were cut in favour of Blade Splicer, as Coco into Wisp+Splicer = 10 power, which is nuts after a wrath. Have you tried him in your build at all?
Dulwich Hamlet is fun on the dafuge challenge I'm doing for my current save because they get very good attendance for that level and are based in London so have lots of room for growth. They also have a very solid team for the Conference South right off the bat and a decent rep for getting a senior affiliate. Makes consecutive promotions pretty easy and viable.   In 16 I had a very long Chelmsford LLM save because they had a fun striker at the lower level who got some absurd number of goals and a cool shade of red for their uniforms.   I also loved a Paris FC save I did a long time ago. Surpassing PSG wasn't easy :/
I would throw it in a Orlandeau Chain, and I use Toxic Rain to boost the chain to 10 super quick.  So i think maybe 1-2 hits wouldnt be at max multiplier, bit still boosted
I've said it to not have to repeat my very first comment over and over.   Over-valuing looks in women is a way of objectifying them. It ties self-worth to appearance. It ties societal worth to appearance. Everything about the woman is superseded by appearance.

Wow you have really been thru a lot !!  I'm also a chronic pain patient from loads of painful illnesses. Don't know What to tell you tho about the oxynorm. I've had to take OxyContin &amp; oxycodone daily for 20 yrs for severe chronic pain and I've also been very physically dependent. I've never gone a few days off my meds like you have but after Arizona recently changed MD prescribing opiate &amp; benzo laws, they've made me so angry I've tapered off OxyContin &amp; Xanax past couple months and now tapering off oxycodone. Not sure if I can exist off oxycodone but I'm sure going to try!  The Oxys did not control all my pain either even at very high dose.  You might want to try tapering off and then only using as needed.   Blessings you are in my prayers. You might try a little kratom to help w wd symptoms. Red vein works best for pain but it's addictive so be careful. I'm not a fan of kratom but if you run out of meds u might need something for the pain
I'm glad :-)
They picked the whitest dude ever in the UFC to match with Snoop Dogg?  This is one of those crazy ideas that just might work.

Build railroads and plumbing and all that?  So high five to Hungary  
If you're trying to be competitive you're gonna spend money even if there wasn't a keyboard. A good pair of headphones with decent soundstage will be $100+. An elite controller or that other brand $150+. The player base needs to be as large as possible since there are more and more quality games coming out splitting them. Especially with the more and more players switching to PC which affects the console player base

But there is when you look at the whole range of possible views because there are only so many and they all broadly fit into a two axis scale, one for left and right, the other for libertarian versus authoritarian.

Only westerners who are too poor to afford an international school would put their kids in a local one. Generally, these people leave China when they have kids, because they want a better environment to raise them and can enjoy a good quality educationnal system for free in.their home country. So it's extremely rare ( for westerners at least). But when you're from Africa I can understand that living in China could bring your family a higher quality of life compared to what you get back home. It's clearly not the case for ANYONE who's from a developed country.

I once forgot the sugar in a vegan cake.  I ended up with a brick of a cake, completely inedible and that's before I mention the taste.  It happens, especially with something you've made before.

Pretty good little trap beat. If I could criticize anything it'd be the drums. They sound a bit stiff and synthetic. Throw a bit of reverb on them and experiment with the EQ and you'd be surprised at how much better they'd snap. The melody could use a bit of variation as well. You are solid on most of the fundamentals just keep playing around with settings and find your sound.

You've obviously shared a lot together and that's not something to be overlooked. I can't tell you what to do I can just tell you how I see it.  First of all reflect on yourself - have you had any desire for another girl at all, even jokingly? Have you ever felt attracted sexually to another girl? If no - your personalities, ideas of a relationship, are different. The future at this point is quite uncertain. People can't change who they really are down to the core, but a lot of outside factors can change how we behave including fear, sadness, opinions of other people, doubt, insecurity and so on. If yes - you can relate on why she did what she did.  As we grow up we certainly feel the need to explore and experience. I understand you might not feel the need to, already having everything you want, but a lot of other people out there need to go through this phase. Essentially it's a phase of discovering one self. It's a tough choice that only you can make no matter what your parents say. It's something you need to ask your inner self to answer. How hurt were you by what she did? Would you be ready to go through the same? Do you genuinely believe she regrets what she did? Just how much exactly do you love her? If you accept her back, would evetything be the same, can you forgive it? Is she really sorry, what keeps her from doing all this again? Answer yourself those questions, and answer them honestly. And remember when you do to actually listen to you. No fear or doubt, no effect of others opinions - just you. I think you might have a clearer view on things after. Good luck pal

He never taught me directly, but I still learned a lot from him. He was murdered when I was 2 months old and I only found out when I was about ten. Ever since then, I read newspaper articles about that day and I realise how suddenly and drastically lives can change in an instant. The decisions of one person created a fatherless child and impacted many more people. It really makes me appreciate the people around me, knowing that they could be gone tomorrow.

How? If something is too strong and everyone gets a counter for it...what does it matter what the numbers say?  Nerfing something makes it weak compared to 100 other things.  Buffing one thing that is weak to another thing is more balanced.  Besides...My original comment was a word for word quote of Massive from 1.1. I figured most players would get it.  No nerfs. Only buffs.

i see your point. i was mostly trying to fit it into the "do you want‚Ä¶" meme
I'm obviously missing something, but I'm not sure what. Jon kept saying this game was 2 generations old, isn't it just one generation? RDR was on 360/PS3, current generation is Xbox One/PS4. One gen, right? What am I missing? 
Thank you
What's crossdressing?
Well not necessarily refuse but they try to lower my dose, try to convince me to retry a med that previously didn't work. I have to go in every month and pick up a paper prescription and they won't do it until the day I'm out. It's such a hassle and several times, several doctors have continually put me off and put me off when I need a refill and I end up going days without my meds. They just all act so hesitant to write the prescription, I think they are scared of getting their license revoked or something similar.

Oh, well as fun as that sounds, I guess I'll have to be strong this time and avoid the new gameplay. No spoilers for me. Hope you guys had a fun stream though.
I realize you're making a joke, but I've seen people in this sub essentially say this exactly. It usually comes out as "they should just work harder and stop being lazy". So far I've failed to get an answer to how a person who is bedridden from cancer or another debilitation illness is supposed to "just work harder". Do any nimble navigators want to answer that question?

Driveclub, although I bought it on special so it's not too bad.   Eve Valkyrie, I just don't play it. I played a few missions and got spammed with so many enemies and I could hit anything. I love Star Wars though.   Starblood arena. It's a good game, and I love decent. I would love a single player game with similar gameplay (although not an arena shooter). I guess the initial matchmaking problems turned me off. I'm in Australia and I never found a game. Gave up in the end. 
My amazing boyfriend is also my boy. We are equals until it comes time to play. In theory it should be triggered by something like him putting on his collar but in practice we know eachother well and so there's a little mental switch we flick. It might be me pinning him down playfully and him saying "thank you sir" and then it's on. For the record, there's a decent chance your Dom is as nervous about this as you are - he might be worried you aren't looking for a boyfriend and feel that he needs to remain the big bad dom in order to keep you. In other words - communicate for fucks sake! üòà

If I know it's a roundabout or junction where a lot of lorries or buses go past I'm gonna keep the bike upright even if it means I have to lean off the bike myself a bit. And instead of accelerating through the corner I will just maintain more of a steady speed so that I have more evenly distributed traction on my tyres. If it's been raining slightly it also brings the oils out to the surface so I'll do the same thing then too. This is different to after a heavy downpour, when it washes the roads and then I'll generally ride a bit harder.

If I'm having a string of those days I try to wake up early so I can watch TV before work for a little while.  Watching other people be normal makes me feel a little more ready for the day eventually.  I like Desperate Housewives the ABC original series, puts me in a pleasant mood.  I know waking up early those days sounds impractical but it's much easier when you know you're only going to watch TV for a couple hours.  If I'm caught off guard by it I make sure to shower, brush my teeth, and I'm a big proponent of make up especially in this context.   Not applicable to many men but, maybe comb your hair or shave would be similar? That's my brain fog day management routine.  Doing that makes me look like a human being on the outside, which I've found is enough to get through work despite no feelings on the inside.  I've managed to do those 3 things just about every morning for at least a year now, despite brain fog days.  I think because I've told myself for so long that I'll manage as long as I do those three things, it works.  Maybe find a few things that make you feel human, tell yourself they will make you feel human, and after doing them for a while it might work!  That said, I feel okay taking a needed day off work.  Sometimes it's just not gonna happen.
trump doesnt know anything .. literally.   there is no way that imbecile would have taken the stance on climate change without being told to (because it is unlikely he even knew what it was).  pulling out of the accord is a gop imperative. trump is boasting "proud" not so much because he is stupid, but because it makes his supporters feel good about puffing murica's chest out.

Thats true, but on the spreadsheet its considered that the profit with, lets say, mana potion cask is 50k - cask price. Thats not really true because you are not paying 50k in the potions from NPC, you are only paying 45k because you will sell the flasks.  The thing is, the wasting 5 gps per potion comes from the fact that, if you did it the other way (buying from NPC) you would get 5gps from it.

That's why you trust in what medical professional knows what is in your best interest at that time. It would be impossible to know what is best in that scenario unless you went through an equal amount of education.   Even women themselves won't possibly know what hidden damage this procedure may or may not be doing to them. This is the basis for scientific progress.  My old history teacher put it best "How the fuck would Billy in a trench in 1917 know what the fuck happened at the Somme more than an historian who dedicated his MOTHERFUCKING life to it"
OK, lets find 10,000 people who acted like Philiando Castille, and 10,000 people who are clearly non-compliant, and see what the **average outcome** is for both groups.    I mean, what happened in that situation is terrible, but are you seriously trying to say that because of that incident, you shouldn't even bother complying?  That's fucking terrible advice if that is what you mean.   Furthermore, I said a pretty decent amount of police brutality videos involve blatant non compliance.  I did NOT say "literally every police brutality situation involves non compliance and literally everybody who complied has always been treated properly.   I'm legitimately confused, what logical point are you trying to make?    ___________   What the fuck is with the downvotes?  Are at least 8 people actually trying to say that compliance is not on average much safer than non compliance?
I believe in karma. Not like its some mystical force of balance or anything, but rather the idea that helping others will lead to more situations of people willing to help you in the future, or that just being a good person is something that other people around you can see.  A lot of the moments in my life that were saved by the generosity of another person, came about as a result of the choices Ive made in the past

Yeah, using a proper pot will really increase your yields/plant size/health/etc so it is a must for sure!   your pots look like 0.25-0.5 gallon nursery pots, which is a huge bottleneck in your grow.   Definitely go with smart pots too, they blow away a normal pot any day! With 50% perlite in my soil and smart pots, I achieved about DWC levels of veg growth speed which is about 1-2" a day on every top/node. All of the oxygen in my rootzone from all that perlite and the smart pots is directly responsible for this! DWC works so well for the same reason, it prodives a ghuge amount of oxygen to your rootzone.

I'm a huge rally fan and my whole world changed as a kid when my dad told me people had to pick fingers from the rad scoops of a Metro 6r4.

He's one of those guys that has a lot going for him and not much against him. The l85 is an amazing rifle; good damage, slowish rate of fire, and stupidly easy to control recoil. The smg11 is a great secondary, and it gives him a nice cqb backup since most sledge players are going acog on the l85. Frags for kill potential or more often to dispose of barbed wire. And the biggest reason is the vertical gameplay meta. Sledges hammer makes it easy to open reliable sized holes above the objective and make it easier to maintain control over an objective. If you watch the pro league, you'll see that it's actually not very common to use the hammer to open up walls because it just gives the roamers a free rotation hole more often than not.

It's solely for the money. I think a small part would be regrouping/ seeing how many of your fans actually follow you to another platform, such as YouTube, but it seems Youtube is better in every other way except for money for streamers. Besides, you are allowed to stream on multiple platforms at once- Twitch is only gaming. You can do gaming on twitch and irl on YouTube, but not gaming on both.
You should also post this to twitter.
I guess it doesn't. But wait, Steve Buscemi just so happens to be a producer on this movie seems odd doesn't it? Didn't Steve Buscemi just so happen to be at one of the biggest staged incidents in the world 9/11? Now why would Steve Buscemi just so happen to be smack dab in the middle of the two largest conspiracies in the whole world? And isn't it a little weird how Steve Buscemi just so happens to be a talented actor and worth millions of dollars, seems like he might've had quite a few connections to get funding like that, now wait a minute, if you look at his filmography he just so happened to be in spy kids 2, in which he is a scientist stuck on an island ruled by his own creations. Now why would he be in a movie about spys if it wasn't a message, maybe a cry for help that his own wrong doings have trapped him and now he must get help to take down what he created? That's right Steve Buscemi and Louis C.K. are teaming up to take down the GOP right from the inside of Washington D.C. but why? To get revenge for 9/11 of course.

I remember last year, I went to see them at msg during wintour. Because of this I obviously slept in after being out late. However, the boys were playing another show the day the msg show at Foxwoods in upstate CT. Apparently, while I was sleeping in my dad went to the store and while he was on the highway he saw two page gold buses with a screen in front that had FOB in giant letters head in the direction of Foxwoods. So basically long story short my dad saw Fall Out Boy's tour buses heading to a show while I was still sleeping in because of the concert the night before 
if they go to Brazil Game Show that would be cool too
Well, there's voter ID laws that aren't accompanied by policies that ensure that all voters can obtain such IDs without undue hardship or inconvenience--you know, the thing we're talking about in this thread. Gerrymandering is another one.
I wouldn't mind having my province on my flair. This has crossed my mind as well. And might be helpful in Sunday Swap.

I'm an electronic technician by trade and recently I've been getting into robotics as a hobby/potential future profession so I'd be happy to learn about anything in the field from someone who is enthusiastic enough about their work to want to teach it. What would be good to know beforehand?
The show took a turn the moment they killed Locke. 
To my understand if he was playing with a 4k he would then be 5k. Maybe I missunderstand. Still have not ONCE had a non international ranked player in international ranked, is this only a party queue issue?

I have next to zero problems with front squats.  They don't hurt, I can breathe, etc.  At first they were awkward.  Just a counterpoint to the "front squats are the worst thing in the universe" meme.
I never saw it that way because I'm bring dragged into a life style and seeing things I thought I would never ever see or be part of. This was great

Plenty of comments here hitting the mark, so just some notes on terminology:  * "Bass side" or "bass buttons" refers to the left hand side of the accordion.  Some sets of reeds on the bass side are often tuned higher than those on the "treble" side.  * "Bass" when used on a treble side register switch, as in your photograph, refers to the lowest-sounding reed block on the treble side.  Sometimes also called the "Bassoon" setting.  I would not personally refer to this as a "bass" set of reeds, to avoid confusion -- maybe just call it your lowest set of reeds on the treble side.  Wordy but accurate.  * Your accordion has two individual sets of reeds (each set in its own reed block) on the treble side.  You haven't shown any info on the bass side, but I would guess that it has four sets of reeds (set in two reed blocks).  If so, this would be referred to in shorthand as a 2/4 LM accordion.  * Bass reed blocks usually have two different sets of reeds per block, unlike treble reed blocks.  Each set of 12 reeds is a different voice.  Each treble reed blocks has just one set of reeds, but spanning 2+ octaves.  * Fun aside: your accordion's register switch symbols are upside-down.  
Seriously speaking, "Good Game" would go over with me so much better than "GG &lt;3"

I hate to say it but ugh, the cliche "everything heals with time" is true. In time (different for everyone) you'll move on and you'll be a stronger and more independent person, and as a result you'll be more of your "true self" so the right person will find you. The heartbreak you feel now might stick with you but it kind of evolves into a different kind of hurt - and you might even be grateful that it happened, even if it still kinda stings a little. That heartbreak will go from sobbing and fatigue and feeling hopeless to the same pain you now feel when you remember that time your brother ruined your favorite toy when you were 6, but you grew up and got over it, lol  source: same, but 4 years post-breakup :) you'll be okay!

What is this? Repost directly from the front page hour?
Quite the opposite actually.  I have one main account that I whale on, but things tend to be pretty easy when you have multiple of almost every TMR in the game.  I have two alt accounts that are F2P with some of my best pulls over the past year.  I casually run raids with them, do dailies when I can.  If I am TMRing almost 24/7 with my main, the alt accounts give me something to do while in the bathroom, etc.  The other accounts are there when free tickets come out, compensation lapis, the free 10+1 ticket, simply there to pull units and enjoy a little gambling.  Those accounts don't really do much, but if I have the time to start them all up, I will do the free pulls this month. I really enjoy re-rolling on occasion because of the lottery element to it.  I simply keep those accounts in Memu and boot them up every so often.

I've heard that about Bangkok - I was just giving myself wiggle-room for Jetlag.

All these confirm that I either like highly abstract/stylized covers or ones that feature a super wide angle. I skim over all the covers with mid or close shots or just pictures of weapons. 
The CVs primary duty is to give eyes to the fleet and kill enemy battleships.  Yes this overspecialization really harms the versatility a good CV driver can bring, but if everyone is doing their job, it's not a problem. You can still scout DDs, you just can't kill them. You shouldn't be picking fights with CAs anyway.  I think Enterprise could be better, but in the right fleet she'll do well. If and when we get clan matches, I wonder if she'll see a lot of use.

Sorry, I meant can't.  So your problem is with a matter of how impressive the fight is?  It doesn't matter. High level PvP is about dodging, predcting, avoiding getting hit, punishing. Not about dealing a high amount of hits. Again, if you want PvP with long fights, go low level. You just complain for the sake of complaining.
That could lead to sometimes fiery, sometimes friendly rivalries, especially early on. As societies develop, I suspect it would become more friendly the closer you came to modern time. What kind of vegetables/fruits do Minotaurs eat? Eih-Curs are especially fond of cabbage, lettuce, and onions.

I don't like this.  Mills is a lame duck. Yes, I'm sure he's respected around the league but what has he actually done? Masai made the Raptors relevant. Presti drafted 3 superstars. Griffin constructed a roster around the best player in the world that went to the finals 3 years in a row.  In all his time with the Knicks, what tangible thing has Mills done? And why choose someone who hasn't actually done anything, yet again, when better options are staring us in the face?

Yup. 
They are gunna show up to work even though they loose money? Thats when crime and being in a gang becomes more appealing because you are literally on the brink of starving to death.  And ethics matter because a society operates better when there isn't massive inequality and resentment by a large group within the population. Labour disputes used to often get violent and fatal 100 years ago. Workers need legal protection.  Also its not worth a persons time in a developed country to do a simple manufacturing job that can be done where the cost of living and cost manufacturing is low. Also I don't see McDonalds moving to Poland and shipping burgers. We need to rely on advanced industries, not simple unskilled labour.   It couldn't hurt to make changes in society to reduce population increases among lower income people, but increasing inequality does more harm then good.

We can't keep him at 20 mil a year but we most definitely still need him.   He provided every spark we needed to our two most recent trophies and he does a lot of the work with the young guys on our team. He is the most level headed one they call an adult in the room.  On top of that, Steph and KD said they would take less to make sure he can get brought back on.   Any warriors fan saying we don't need iggy is really in denial IMHO.

Unrestrained pets are the number three cause of fatal car accidents in my state. The pet jumps, the driver swerves to react, they crash. A harness connected to the seatbelt system or a proper pet carrier is what's recommended. Realistically, people just let their dogs bounce all around the car though.

I had just bought Guitar Hero and was playing it at home. The guitar's front surface was very smooth, slick plastic. I had applied one of the included stickers onto it - a large Skull &amp; Crossbones. As I played the guitar, the sticker slowly slid off the guitar and onto my shorts. I didn't realise, and *went to the shops like that*. Noticed a lot of people giving me strange looks. On my way back to the car, I suddenly realised I had been walking around amongst hundreds of people with a fucking skull and crossbones decoration right exactly front-n-center on the crotch of my pants.

All I can speculate is that there's something about the price tag and the service given that makes it worth it. Some of the more costly practices offer to bring over any family that you left behind, over X amount of years - so maybe?
I'm not going to say I wish you didn't exist cuz thats mean.. but every time I see you comment, I wish I hadn't existed to read it. 
glad someone dropped him in my league. The hit he allowed in the 2nd should of been an error too.
Ah yes, I can't beat them under normal circumstances so I'll just play a killer that has no counter.  Why try to play the game when you can just win, right? 
Big clue that he's not well.  This is not normal ppl behaviour. 
Like who? Call of the dead was the only map. But then again I can kinda see your point. But doing an Easter egg and unlocking a fifth character to play as is something treyarch has never done before 
That's why we have one of the best academy programs in the country. 
Loving the textures seems like smeared pastel or oil.
That's terrible and I'm sorry you had to experience that. People are just so shitty. 
I'm afraid that's a question I'll need more time to answer. I had a bunch of free time yesterday, but not enough today. I'll mull it over and get back to you when I've got a free hour or so.  RemindMe! 2 days
Yeah but you said steaks.

Don't worry the glock is easy to find, but the groza might take you a while, you'll be better of ambushing people as they move from an airdrop than going for it yourself!
Yep, I was a clicker at first. Had a hard time switching to keybinds until I got the multibutton mouse. It took a few months to get used to but now I run 54 different combinations on it. Just takes practice.
I'll be honest. I'll quit a game early if I run into someone who runs nothing but edge blitzes and blitzes that the fucking line refuses to slide to. Or people who run those fucked up plays where they come out in tight formation. I can't defend that formation for my life.
Sometimes I have hope in humanity. Sometimes. Then this happens.
This so sounds like the sort of thing that Southampton were bitching about in the first place...
I get it

Liberal exposure. Most people don't want illegals here.
If he's in college, that makes him like 18-22ish?  So I'm going to assume she's 14 or younger unless you tell me otherwise.  Also, why are you friends with 14 year old girls?
700 is quite dead since there are bots and new players that will prolly quit soonn, the new phRO is wayy more populated and fun
Not watching. What makes you say that
Just as well Nintendo get buy by people buying software. That aint going to help if people aint got shit to play it on though is it.  I fear the SNES classic will be as rare as rocking horse shit.
The winter is very wet and very quiet here. Traffic ,what little we have in the summer, is cut like 60% so the main drag is pretty quiet. Many of the store shut and board up for the winter. I have an inside job so the rain really doesn't bother me. We had a rough winter this year, got 14 inches of snow one night, which is a bunch here. But there is a bunch of depression here in the winter to, no sunlight.   Yeah they got right on that dock repair. Had it fixed in 2 weeks I think, maybe 3.
That is your choice, but the natives are getting restless. We have to find a way to clean everything up because we can't continue on this path.

I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure the missions do NOT count. This is not for any missions, this is for vouchers, which means random WANTED encounters you run into from scanning someone who is wanted then killing them. Go to a res site and start scanning people. I turned in one voucher that was only worth 13000 credits and was immediately in the 100 percentile.
You take your dog to the fucking vet right now. 
Lol Carter was DFA's but is back up due to injury. Also Springer laughing and hugging Carter was adorable.

That could just be how Cersei perceived things. Doesn't mean it's a fact, but I do think Tywin loved Jaime the most. Or at least liked him the most.
I'm in for slot two

You're absolutely right. Kind of thought to myself that it was funny to have a 1.25" tee on a small tank but there it is. To OP: a 0.75" tee and nipple is what you will need. Good eye, /u/slowtdi
Ok, this explains his recent behaviour
All of which are more effective with a trained adult in the room. Hence the encouragement to avoid homework, and instead have them wrestle with the work in the classroom, where they can immediate feedback.

I've had this happen before. I know that in my situation, after a few times of her not texting me back, I just tried to put it out of my mind for a bit. She eventually texted me again.
Damn, he was, wasn't he? I was ready to defend my boy Luffy but the more I thought about it, he was bodied at Marineford. 
Ssumday had a rough game against Impact and he went from a Reddit favorite for mvp to not even in the conversation.  I'm not even a big fan of Ssumday and never really thought he was a contender, but what the fuck?  Reddit doesn't even have the memory of a goldfish.  I struggle to think of another sub or forum for any (e)sport that has more consistently horrifically bad but wildly popular analysis than r/leagueoflegends
Nice find! Pretty chill Kool &amp; the Gang jazz remix, I like it.
The first two hits of the art are true, the final (and most damaging) hit is not - but a lot of the time, it's worth doing to do just because sometimes they won't roll or they'll try to block or whatever. Regardless, I think it's more damage than two R1s anyway.

Don't expect him to make an impact this year... he's been battling injury after injury (just hit the DL again with back issues a few weeks ago) and he's been surpassed in the pecking order.  Honeywell has been much better than his 4.91 Triple-A ERA suggests, but TB likes to slow-roast their pitchers so I wouldn't expect him to get the call until September barring injuries.

Also I saw that comment you deleted [{image}](http://i.imgur.com/fUg2bUg.png).  And my response (that I was typing out before you deleted it): &gt;So you think it's actually more ethical to be forced to exist in a way that will most likely be agonizing, than not to exist at all?  &gt;You seem to be arguing from the position that non-existence is a negative state, when it's as neutral as possible. Ethical concerns cannot apply to something that does not exist.  &gt;Having children at *all* is already an ethically sketchy proposition, but when the deck is about as stacked as possible against any prospective offspring, that tips the scale all the way to 'what the fuck do you think you're doing' territory.
Not over 700 complaints. Over 700 burns. 
To me, it's people like you who stir up shit where there's really no shit to stir up at. Making people second guess themselves and unhappier because of it.   You don't know jack about their relationship, but you talk about servitude. You have absolutely no clue what the husband does in the relationship, he might to absolutely everything else from fixing stuff, having a lot more demanding/harder job that brings in most of the money, taking the kids to school every morning, etc.  You have no idea, but you're still ready to label her as being in servitude.   What you're doing is not only stupid, but it's harmful.
