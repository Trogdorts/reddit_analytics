I definitely see where you are coming from on that, but wouldn't some form of regulation still be better than none at all? Like you said, everything is regulated. Should we make tobacco and alcohol illegal just because the harm is being reclassified and hidden by corruption?  This is an issue that will never, and i repeat, NEVER, be gone. The way I see it we have two options, legalize and regulate, or do neither and let it continue as it is right now.

I'm sure there is software or a script to flash the virtual drive back to the other one on startup.  Honestly though with SSD's load times aren't that intrusive these days and for the money you could just run 2 in raid 0.  Back in the day they did PCI ram hard drives that had a backup power supply for some applications and I do remember people gaming on them. The fuss isn't worth the 20 seconds of your life it saves.
HOWEVER, the existing brakes (def. worth something) and freewheel will still work just fine if you don't want to replace them. The freewheel may not have scalloped teeth, but its much higher quality than any new freewheel this side of an IRD one

T-Mobile is actually starting to throttle their unlimited users depending on the network conditions. I'm a heavy user, and if I'm within the top 3% of that quarter, I'll see my speeds drop from 50mbps to a uncomfortable 3-4mbps.
she pissed all over my bed then i got woke up by her in the morning on the phone to her mates saying she thinks i pissed the bed. I then check my boxers which are bone dry at the front and jump up out the bed, she then immediately hangs up the phone and starts crying begging me not to tell anyone.  I since found out from her friends that she also did it to someone else, got up during the night and rolled him in the piss and fled the scene of the crime.  0/10 would not bang again.

That makes me sad :( and the pushback of coupons means no keyboard when my stuff comes in. Oh well, thanks for the info.

Hahahahahah.  Holy fuck.  The amount of fucking hypocrisy in this thread. So when we discuss white right wing conservative, we care about skewed results? We care about population percentages?

I'm not sure where you live, but as far as I'm aware you don't need a prior owners permission to register an animal. Register the cat with the city (usually for a nominal fee, under $20). Further establish ownership by taking him to the vet and paying for his care (even if its just a checkup). The only thing I can think of that you might need her cooperation on is changing the info on his microchip if he has one, but even then I'm not sure you need it (but you will have to pay a fee to do it).  Take screenshots of her messages to you and send one to the friend she told you stole it, you don't even need to say anything else, the screenshot alone is enough. Do that any time someone asks you about it - word will get around really quickly that she's a liar.
Good lord is that album great, so much emotion and feeling just oozing from it on every level. Wait is good, but Paralyzed and Mansion are my favorites. Mostly because they're a bit *too* real and the first listen was tough.   crywolf and NF collab would be soooooo neat

Funny. I didn't see women getting defensive about the post about wives. 
I've worked in management at a theme park for a long time. We once had a ring of thieves in a scam like this: janitorial employees would salvage used Dippin Dots cups, sell them back to the vendor employees for $2 and the vendors would sell the product in the used cups for $4.  My idiot manager fired the employees that he could identify. He didn't flag the rest that were suspected of theft, and one of them was eventually rehired by the theme park AS A SECURITY GUARD. The kid eventually made it to supervisor.
I'm just not the type of person to talk about relationship issues openly. I like keeping my personal life pretty personal, unless it's somewhat anonymous on Reddit.

Not convicted. And he has been 100% open about it and admitted it might have been rape. The reason he's not sure is because the girl was being difficult (this isn't me being sexist, she was literally changing her story over and over). I don't think Kobe consciously made the decision to hurt her, so I can be a bit more forgiving 
...It's certainly "magically limited" because all extrapolations forward in time from now (the time period for which we are predicting) only *exist* in a post-9/11 world, and the distinction is quite significant but not reflected in the data.  Again, we're not looking for a *mathematically rigorous* model, but one that we can actually use to make good predictions in order to direct allocation of resources and attention. 9/11 was a historically momentous terrorist attack the likes of which hasn't been seen since in the United States. There is absolutely a lot of variance in terrorist attacks, but how many deaths do you think there will be to terrorism next year? What should we prepare for--how scared should Americans be? Definitely not as afraid as your numbers would indicate. Large attacks are one thing, but decidedly enormous and rare attacks such as 9/11 are useless for answering these questions and useless for providing context to the real-world, modern-day danger of the two groups they are studying here.  Yes, your math lines up. But your conclusions do not because you don't have enough data and you're choosing to ignore the other information available to you.
Went to the Texans Panthers game this year. Can confirm.

Wow so the mods of this sub are censoring people who speak out against Emily to protect her? When all this user said was the truth about what she did?   They used no harsh words, no vulgarity, etc..

Perdoa-me a inocência/ignorância, mas o que é isso? Não conheço.
Thanks! Radical feminist criticism of Harry Potter isn't an area I'm familiar with, so I appreciate your getting me started. But what I was really hoping for was something supporting your statement that radical feminist condemnation was louder than fundamentalist Mormon/Christian condemnation of the books. I see that this article establishes that some feminists were criticizing the books, but while the article might establish that they were making claims that were insufficiently well thought out, it doesn't establish that they were *radical* feminists, and nowhere does it compare their loudness to that of religiously-motivated Harry-Potter-condemners. Your comparative claim--that radical feminists were louder than religious fundamentalists in criticizing the books--seems especially difficult to support, which is why I asked for a source instead of just googling it myself.
My 'induction' was to go to the lab and ask for the long weight.  I decided I'd do it later.

Interesting!
everybody fucks up with bills now and then, that is why autopay is a thing. you can also try to call up your car insurance company and ask the split the missed month over a couple months. worst thing they can tell you is "no".
I don't think that I will ever not give any damn about what happened, so that is not my definition of recovery.  Speaking of which, I don't have a definition of recovery. I don't know. But I don't think I'm very "recovered" - though that is hard to say, as I don't know what recovery is.   I once told a therapist that I wanted my parents to be dead to me. She said "you can never have it like they are dead to you - they are your parents."  I really want for her to be wrong, but I am worried that she is right.  That would be awful if she were. 
I'm okay with my current PSU I think.

Well your processor and RAM are more than good, but your video card is a little weak.  I guess I would be a little hesitant to recommend you try the game on PC.  If you just get a new graphics card though, you'll have a great gaming rig for JC3 and everything else.  Might be a worthy investment for $200-300, especially if you sell your old card for $50-100.
Best anti rape device, a gun. Please, for the love of god shoot the fuck out of anyone raping you or someone else. We really need to phase that behavior out of our genome. 
I stopped for 4-5 weeks while figuring out what to do about high estrogen.  It was not pleasant.  I gained weight even while on caloric restriction and exercising.  My wife says I turn into a bitch when my T is low.  She doesn't like any competition in that realm for she is the Queen B of the Universe.  I weighed more and had much lower muscle mass before TRT.  If you stop TRT, I expect your body fat percentage to go up higher than it is now because you will be lacking the hormone that helps limit fat storage.  If I binge eat sweets, I still gain weight.  TRT can't help that.  That's a me problem.  For the wife issues, step on over to /r/TheRedPill for some illumination on how the female brain works to manipulate you.  Don't believe everything you read over there, though.  Avoid the pick-up artist rhetoric.  Just be aware that your wife can't leave you alone:  she is driven to reform you into what she can control because she thinks that gives her the security or comfort that she wants.  Be your own man.  You can still love and care for your wife without being under her thumb.  Forgive me if I've read too much into your situation.  I've been married to the same woman for 18 years.  TRP taught me some things that help me deal with my wife and my daughter.

I use the Burberry Luminous Fluid Base in Nude Radiance and the Becca Backlight Primer (after several months of use I have decided that they are near identical) and I think that they look best layered. I usually use them with a nearly full coverage foundation that would normally look very matte and flat. They give it a little bit of life. I usually still highlight with a powder over the foundation.

Two stories:  1) working at a summer camp, we were sitting around outside at night, planning out the next few days, eating snacks, and chatting. We hear a noise by a tree nearby where a friend had left his backpack, and shining a light on the pack revealed a large mother raccoon and 3 small babies. The mama, without breaking eye contact with us, used her tiny, creepy human-like hands to unzip the backpack zipper, remove a bag of Cheetos, pass it back to her babies, and ZIP THE BAG BACK CLOSED. A few moments went by in silence before my friend whispered, "but... Why did she zip it closed...?"  2) Crows on our block would gather nuts with a hard shell and drop them on our street. I thought they were just trying to break them by dropping them from high up, but the would actually place them so the cars would drive over and crack the nuts.  Animals are awesome.
For gelato [Honeysuckle Gelato](https://www.honeysucklegelato.com). They opened their first store at Ponce City Market but you can also get pints at a bunch of big chain (Whole Foods) and small local markets (Lucy's Market).
This year at Coachella a friend hippie flipped(shrooms+mdma) he started with the shrooms somehow his phone gets lost and his trip just goes south. It's day 1 his phone is lost the day isn't over he just feels so shitty. Decided to take his pill to salvage his day. And he said it made it worse. When I finally caught up to him he just looked so bummed and not having a good time. I'm not sure what you would be mixing but be safe op! 
Wonderful news. The resurgence of the Basque language and other regional identities in post-Franco Spain is one of our greatest cultural assets. Hopefully such distinctions will celebrated and enshrined into the fabric of the nation in future days, instead of a fracturing of the country.
Intentionally shocking perhaps but also some really effective imagery that sticks with you after the shock.   At least for me.

Divi is a decent theme, not too bloated despite its functionality.  But like others have said, no theme is perfect.  You will most likely still want to adjust things and it's done the same way as for other themes, via CSS and occasional php and you will still learn from it.
This is so wrong.  Double-blind trials are nice and all, but there are other ways to make inferences.
I see no issue here at all. From my perspective I see a woman too old to be living at her parents house who are apparently having a very active and healthy sex life. If your sister has a problem she should get headphones, ear plugs or even go for a walk. Or you can go full adult and move out. 
Worth a try.  I'll call the store to see if they can help.  Thanks!
I don't see why not - it says you have to spend $15, so it would have to be $15 total after your discount.

I agree with what you said, I really like a lot of the new units but a lot of them are almost instantly outclassed. JP has a lot more value in their units and that's awesome. But at the same time I really love those global exclusives, as well as all the cool exclusive dungeons and things like that. In the end they're both pretty great.
I think I may just do XIII, XIII-2, and XIII Lighting Returns. Does that sound good? If I can squeeze it I'll also to try to do X and X2 remastered for PS3 since I hear it's good.

I am about 2/3 done. If you are interested 'Fire and Feathers' are the two main characters and protagonists.  One is a man, Alex,  who channels fire and sunlight.  The other is a woman, Osprey, who has feathers in her hair and can fly on the wind and fights with a curved dagger.  They are fighting in a version of the Underworld/Limbo where it is eternal night.  It's really good fun!  Though it gets a little dark and morbid in places.  I have all the plot planed I'm just in the process of slotting it all together so it makes sense

Yeah that was the only thing I didn't get. I drink while tripping all the time, I think it makes the comedown and afterglow a lot better. As far as I'm aware, LSD and Alcohol have no synergistic properties but are completely safe. It could maybe be that OP is worried about really drunk college kids taking LSD for the first time and a) losing control of their trip and doing dumb shit that'll get them arrested, or b) not being coherent enough to save themselves from a bad trip or even a psychotic break if it gets overwhelming as a first time use.

Now they've all moved out, and eventually their mom wanted to move or get rid of all the games that were still in their parents' house. When I mentioned some of the games probably had good value, their response was "Well we made sure she kept the good ones like Contra and Super C". So they only ended up keeping a few games, and they definitely ended up getting rid of some valuable stuff. It was pretty clear they didn't realize, but also didn't really care about the actual value. I think that still happens a good bit with some of these collections. 
I haven't really heard Geoff talk about stuff like that much, even though it was just him saying "yeah" it took me by surprise. 
Well, waterja+ruinga is useful on 90% of the bosses, and waterja+thundaja is enough for the other 9%. However, *if you already have thundaja and waterja honed*, bioga covers much more uncovered stuff than firaja and blizzaja combined (all ice weakness bosses up to now can be easily defeated with blizzaga+waterja with no real resistance and I still don't have blizzaja as of yet).   And for Drainga/Darkra, yes I still haven't find enough orbs to hone either, so I guess there's no point arguing about them at this moment and let's just say that both are unnecessary at this exact moment.

A limit, in the simplest sense, is just something you can get arbitrarily close to. Take for example the linear function y=x. The limit of that function as x goes to 1 is 1. What this means is, by taking values of x arbitrarily close to 1, you can also make y arbitrarily close to 1. You can make x = 0.999, and y also gets close to 1. And you can keep adding more nines to the end of that, and y will keep getting closer to 1 without ever reaching 1. And you can keep doing this no matter how close you make x to 1, ie. No matter how many 9s you tack on the end.  Similarly, lets say F(x) = 1/x. The limit of F as x goes to infinite is 0. What this means is, you can make F as close to 0 as you want by making x really really big. And you can keep doing that forever by taking bigger values of x, it never breaks down. You can get f arbitrarily close to 0 by taking x arbitrarily large.  Now, in this case, why is the limit not -1? Because by taking large values of x you cannot get arbitrarily close to -1; the value of F will always be at least 1 away.   That, in a nutshell, is what a limit is. As for how that applies to calculus, that's another story.

So I will just try to input what I think, others can correct me if I am seeing things wrong.  I think you might have waited too long, 1 to 2 weeks and the initial attraction is probably gone, she maybe met some other guy or just forgot about you. Specially if you said that you were not in the mood to talk to people, so maybe you were somewhat forgetable.  Also you should have invited for nice fun things, like a party or some gathering, girls can feel that going out with a guy (that was a little off the day they met) alone in a date a little awkward. You don't need to invite her to a party or to a bar, but maybe if you have plans to go to a book convention with a group of friends ask her if she wants to tag alone.
Answering "Does this make me look fat?" will be a whole lot more difficult.

I don't understand why no one likes Z. He is abrasive, but at least he tries to get people to step back, look at something, and possibly defy convention if the situation calls for it.

This is actually a good question... Like say two teams that were both 2-13 played week 17 and both wanted the #1 pick and one just punted every play and had their defenders just...stand there.

The great thing about making your own wine, is that you can make it to your own taste.  It is easy to back sweeten a wine so I would suggest you ferment it dry and then bottle some of that before back sweetening.   You can do a few modifications to your wine.  Then as it ages, you get the joy of seeing what you like best.
Here comes the downvotes.  Although the writer raises valid points, all of them, Apple will convince their fan base that their way is superior and will have no problem brainwashing those fans into thinking this is a great idea. Like, the best idea that has ever ever existed.

Yeah I've done that before too.  I was pushing the plunger down at enough of an angle for a small opening to form between the rubber and the wall of the Aeropress.   I would guess it is a mix of the plunger being pressed at an angle and higher than normal pressure build up. 
that definitely sounds like a problem with your xbox. If at all possible, I would try to get a friend/relatives xbox hooked up to your same setup to see if anything else is causing it before you swap boxes though, that process is always a pain.

&gt;does posting on five different boards about it stirring people up create drama, or end drama?  Oh I agree the guy totally created a drama and is using it for a blog.  That is the curse of the net. People have found blogs and want instant fame and the easiest way to that is drama. Hell I use the net for my part time job and wish I didn't have to. Its insiduous.  &gt;He wasn't innocent himself - he came straight out of the gate in that thread shutting down anyone who disagreed with him, not in a "like points for like points" style but in an "I know better than you" style.  I honestly didn't see that. I saw someone who wanted to know how other people who followed a path roughly similar to his acted. Then he got pissy when people who didnt follow his path called him out. I would have done the same.   &gt;And he said something about "imaginary friends" that if he'd said it here he'd be instantly banned for it.  and he has since apolagised for it. since he did that I take that comment in a "heat of the moment thing"  now did he go after everyone on r/pagan? he called one mod out by name and every other quote in his piece was used anonymously. I agree he went for /r/pagan in a way that is only going to promote dissention amongst pagans but I don't think he went after the users.  &gt;it's for people to say "ugh, that's so typical of Reddit, I knew I stayed away from that site for a reason".  I've told people in my local group to stay away from Reddit. Reddit is not a safe space. It's not a nice space. It's a terrible terrible place if you are in a certain frame of mind. My partner is not a member. She just read the entire thread and came away saying shes thankful shes not a member.  That is what happens when people say crappy things on the net. people see it and stay away.  Make no mistake I don't think the guy is blameless nor do I think he is someone who should be taken any more seriously than other bloggers. I don't think however that he is entirely 100% to blame for what happened and the fact some people are getting pissy that it is being shown to the world is to my mind a little stupid. whats more if you can't ask a question on r/pagan, r/paganism or r/neopagan without being called an idiot drama queen on every single space then you can't blame the guy for holding a grudge and showing the world.   If you don't want people to think your a bad person, don't be an idiot on the net, that simple.   anyway, something less drama inclined, how was your weekend? 
Thank you!

&gt;Says a lot about the Economist and its readership that they think issues like this can be reduced to bulletpoints.  I'm sorry, the use of bullet points offends you and thus means The Economist is a bad publication? The Economist has been covering the issue of Syria for years in considerable depth. Just because one **image** is there for people to have a quick glance is no way a reflection of the whole publication. You don't even know what article this accompanied.
I don't understand this, but it is hilarious.
It's only really perceptible on high levels, but it's there all across the board. The most obvious reason would be that the featured games are of a lower level, since the pros are of a lower level, which means that players learning from those games are weaker.  Otherwise, there's also the fact that, like I said, there are a lot of trolls in weaker regions (most trolls not being from that region). This inflates the rest of the playerbase's ranking.  It all very small effects taht ends up adding up. The difference is still insanely negligible though. I'd be amazed if there were a single tier of difference across servers for ranks between Bronze 4 and Diamond 2.

&gt;Democracy, or democratic government, is "a system of government in which all the people of a state or polity ... are involved in making decisions about its affairs, typically by voting to elect representatives to a parliament or similar assembly," as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary.[1] Democracy is further defined as (a:) "government by the people; especially : rule of the majority (b:) " a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections."[2]  Yes, having a monarch make our system less democratic. The only reason most people aren't complaining is that its power is currently rarely used in western democracies.

Some DayZ Mod, then Arma 2 a little, and a bit in Arma 3 (400h). I liked it but never got with an incredibly hardcore PvP group (like I did in PlanetSide 2 - 1350h, or Insurgency - 1000h). I do like the more sim-leaning games, though. Americas Army 2.4.5 or so was the first FPS on my computer, I've liked that kind of thing since.  My profile at www.steamcommunity.com/user/kate_utl/ has a list of my FPS experience in there.  How about you?

In a lot of cases it is not so much about accessing equity, but stopping people from putting their released superannuation straight into their the equity on their home to avoid it being assessed as an asset.

True... I'm assuming this just happened to you?
Noah seems to be a big financial leach. In this episode, Cole is saying that he doesn't want any of the money from the sale. Which makes me think that Scottie goes after Alison for Cole's portion of the sale. And since Noah won't want to surrender a dime of the money he's already spent, well, maybe he is the one who kills Scottie. I don't think there's a chance he's remarrying alison.

"I don't believe that quote on Reddit" -Abraham Lincoln
I'm pretty sure the "Reasonable Sunset" maps for current and abolished DST are (incorrectly) exactly the same. That's the metric DST was designed to improve, so its very suspect error to make given the article's argument against DST.  I'd also challenge the sunrise and sunset times the author chose as reasonable. A relatively small subset of the population is awake more than an hour or so before 7 AM. I think most people would be happy as long as the sun is up 30-40 minutes before they need to be at work.  In contrast, a 5 PM sunset seems very early. It really sucks when it's dark as soon as you leave work; you don't get any daylight for your free time. I'm happiest when the sun goes down between 6:30 and 7:30. You get some light for your leisure time, but it's still early enough to not interfere with winding down and going to bed.  Personally, I love DST. I live in Boston, and without it the sun would be up before 4:30 AM for a good chunk of the summer. The sun setting at 8 PM is a little late, but it still gives you 2-3 hours of darkness before bed. Before considering the practicalities of it, I think New England should stay on DST permanently (really Atlantic Standard Time). The daylight situation is really depressing in the Winter. It's often completely dark by the time 5 PM rolls around

I too watched the whole thing and damn that talk filled in almost every question I had developed about ufos over my past 2-3 years of research. I can't stop thinking about the implications of the tech he is talking about. As of right now it would take a lot of convincing to make me think that people like Elon musk and bill gates are genuine when it comes to their "plans" for electric/ renewable energy. I also wanna say that I have fist hand knowledge that Musk is an absolute dick to his employees. Are private space agencies just disinformation centers and theater for the public to munch on while the psychopaths continue to rape Mother Earth?
I googled the Green Arrow.  I am pretty sure this is going to be AWESOME because I might just end up a superhero, too. SCORE.

You never said anything about management being complacent.  I'm defending the players, not the people that control the money.
I seriously doubt it's illegal to get paid to fuck an inanimate object.  Prostitution involves being paid to have sex with the person supplying the money.  Ultimately you should listen to your instinct though and do what you feel is right for you.

&gt; You need to remember that Alonso and Button get poor tyre temps and aero performance because by running on reduced power less energy runs through the car.  This was only speculation at the beginning of the season and is likely not true. Read this, important parts below: http://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/34208407  &gt;"There is a second electric motor - called the MGU-H (for heat) - which recovers energy from the turbocharger. The regulations do not impose a limit on how much energy is deployed to the wheels from this and so it can be considered as 'free' energy."  &gt;"Honda's fundamental problem is that it cannot harvest enough energy to deploy along the entire length of all but the shortest of straights."  Their problem is their small turbo solution is great for packaging but terrible for this "free-energy" recovery that they totally misjudged the importance of.  Their car is working fine for the most part otherwise.

I think Rim Jong Sim should be our sidebar picture. How many records were broken? 8? How many performances rival hers?
So you are arguing "number 1" is some subjective opinion of his?? Like him saying "the pats are still number 1 in the AFC" implies they don't have the best record despite losing last night?  you MUST be some loser brought here from r/all.   I can't tell if the reading comprehension comment is serious or not after your complete failure to undertsand what was said in the original comment and your response.

What if the quality of the raid rewards were tied to the number of attempts at an instance? Include revives back into HM, with an increasing timer similar to trials (but more penal). Perhaps this would help decrease the number of "lets just wipe" scenarios and put more pressure on fireteams to clutch it out. There's still some cushion for the latency issues and mistakes.  I'm not suggesting guaranteeing drops for clears on the first attempt, but decreasing the possibility of attaining at 320 piece after multiple attempts.
That just shows how much porn you watch
I may be covering ground you've already walked, but I figure it's worth saying that it's essentially a business proposal, so don't come empty handed.  Other than insurance issues, it wouldn't hurt to have some metrics (how fast you are during rush hour, etc.), or if you could find them, some statements from local businesses (especially ones that are already customers of that company) that would be interested in a faster on-demand service for local deliveries. Be ready to explain how your dispatch needs to be handled, and outline your capabilities. You need to take as much weight off their shoulders as you can in regards to setting things up. After all, if they wanted to do the research, they would already have bike couriers. The advantage is, once you've done the nitty-gritty, you can just change the name to any local courier company, and keep pitching until it works.

I'm not the guy you're talking to, but I kind of agree with you there. I feel like the CEO of YG Entertainment tried to make her be the female [G-Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJnICByeL8Q) but didn't make her put the effort into it. While he had GD write a song or two a week pre-debut (starting when GD was like 11), CL's lines in a lot of 2NE1's (her girl group's) songs were written by Teddy (a rapper from one of the oldschool YG Entertainment artists [1TYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gh2B1RtJbXg)). I feel like CL hasn't had as much time or freedom  as GD to refine her style and lyrics, which really sucks for her now when she's trying to do solo stuff.  If you're into KPop you probably knew all that already, though.

That's good to hear, assumed it was true after I observed something like this happen. This really small baby bird, I'm talking regurgitated food small, fell out of a nest at my friend's house last summer. We looked at it, saw that it wasn't injured, and put the bird back into the nest. The mother came back, jumped around for like 2 minutes, inspecting it, and then just left and never came back. My friend seemed to think it was because he took the nest down to place the baby bird in the it and then put it back up on the ledge, but i assumed it was because she could smell his hands.

I actually checked my stats last night and found out I'm at 290%, not 390% like I'd thought. It's been a while since my last level-up. :p  I've only killed one so far, so I didn't have the movement down very well like I do with snakes/scorpions/spiders. I would say that at least 50% of my attacks were total misses.

Saw some drawings at an art exhibit at a music festival when peaking off 2 tabs (estimated 100ug each? maybe slightly underdosed). I was getting cool visuals but could tell what was real and what wasn't...until I looked at the drawings. I could not tell if they were drawings or video screens, they looked like they were animated, and not just in a trippy way where things swirl, but things were moving as if that's how the artist meant them to. Leaves swirling around, mouths opening and closing, etc. It was a bunch of drawings by this guy, here's one of them that was amazing at the time:  http://androidjones.com/refuge-%e2%80%a2-2015/
I'm so confused why people actively defend blizzard when they shit all over their customer base so frequently. I obviously wrote the main post when I was really pissed off so the downvotes make sense but I *love* this game and hate seeing it die but also hate that most people still around don't mind standing by and watching it happen ;_;  The fact that you can't reach Rank 1 without experiencing DDoS attacks, bots of any nature, and people using hacks of any nature is very indicative of the current state of the game.
I don't know that they made those racial changes for financial reasons...  Horde was dominating the US ladder, like 87% Horde to 13% Alliance in MoP in addition to being the dominant choice for high end PvE.  They nerfed the Orc and Undead racials and buffed some of the Alliance ones in an attempt to even this out.  Unfortunately, the buff to the dwarf racial was way too strong, so having a dwarf healer was a HUGE deal.  That got nerfed fairly quickly and the horde nerfs were done quickly.  Recently they buffed some of the Horde racials (and there was the buff to the medallion trinkets) so the horde ones aren't any worse than the alliance ones now.  With cross realm and no teams, the advantage for the players is to all stay on one faction to maximize the amount of people they play with.  The only way I can see this problem getting fixed without a silly bandaid (I've seen suggestions like making titles the top% of each faction) is if the PvP community starts growing again so you wouldn't be severely limiting yourself by choosing one faction.  Participation dropped by over 50% from WoD season 1 -&gt; WoD season 2.  From season 2 -&gt; 3 it's dropped 75%.  There's not even enough people doing arena right now to support 2 equal factions.

I think you have a great outlook on this topic and your SO is definitely very lucky. It's a topic that has different opinions according to which person you talk to. It shouldn't have to cost an arm and a leg and should be about the significance of what the action (giving ring) means. I too don't want my SO to spend a lot of money and recently I have realised this. I love him dearly and while we have looked at engagement rings and discussed our future plains it has occurred that when he proposes will mean more to me than any ring.  While depending on where you are located and how much rings can cost they can be bought at a lower price to a ridiculous price. $1500 may seem a lot but in shops Today it actually isn't.  However saying that ... I'm sure a compromise could be found ? Maybe a lower price on the ring and a present for him ? Or holiday? Or money into a savings account ?

I'm not saying that its bad you can disprove things, I'm saying, when you know *nothing* about something, dont act like you do know and like you have all the evidences that support your position. In the past 10 or so years I see more and more scientific studies coming out that begin to reveal things that are well known in practices like yoga for thousands of years. You could at least be more humble, and when something new pops up, give the benefit of doubt that somehow, someone, sometime, may have already found out about it, and knows more than you do, even if its not with the same "proof" that you need to have. Perhaps, considering that, science would be able to look at the topic with a different perspective, and get evidences even faster. But no, lets be arrogant, its not "science", it doesn't matter... sure, take another 100 years, and perhaps you'll get there.  PS - I'm pro-science and I have a science background, I just have a hard time tolerating this sort of dogmatic behaviour towards anything else which is outside your current science books.

Both. It also annoys me that a lot of seemingly light games seem to hammer the CPU. Web browsing, office, videos -- none of those ever turn the fan on on my surface book but I can load a static menu screen in a game and the fans are immediately blasting.
I honestly think it going to turn into a stalemate, the only real progress is the CEA and BEF landings. Operation Zipper is my final operation before I just slowly attempt to a push to Moscow, I think once my Armored forces are ready in early Janurary I'll be ready for Operation Zipper.
It really is. There aren't any stupid cuts to commercials like in so many swamp monster/biggest loser shows, they have gorgeous animal and scenic photography, the immunity challenges are thrilling, and the actual strategies behind alliance building and management is fascinating. Its not all about getting the most outrageous people on the show either. The producers have very smartly chosen seemingly normal people so the focus is always on the game rather than quirky personalities. 
I dont know why everyone thinks its set in stone that Brock is gonna win the rumble.

It's pretty rare that you get in a situation where your entire hand is dead.   I admit the deck is very greedy, but there's just so little aggro these days. Yes, aggro druid and aggro shaman are "popular", but not anywhere near as popular as mid or late game decks. Paladin was literally over 50% of my matchups this season. This allows me to run less taunts and more value-oriented cards.
You're allowed to do things with people that aren't him.  You're allowed to change your mind on what you want to do.   You're not putting your friends over him by wanting to spend one Saturday with someone else.  Your boyfriend is being jealous and possessive.  Give him some time to cool down, but don't apologize for wanting to hang out with your friends.  Reiterate that you're still willing to come see him after you're done hanging out with Courtney, and it really hurts your feelings that he's so mad about this.  Hopefully this was just a knee-jerk reaction to him being annoyed about your changing plans, and he'll apologize after he thinks about it for a while.

I have 5k+ kills on my awp atm. I'm pretty sure I know the feel of it. If we were talking about ak's then I would agree with you. I just don't feel comfortable with an ak. I do try to pre aim.

But I always seem to miss that shot. Yet I tag almost everyone who crosses. To b site.

Judging by u/The-Great-Jebus 's nonchalance, that's not even peak agreement for him. Yet he still dominates that other guy who's agreeing as hard as he can. So either he's a pro, or the original agreeing job was pathetic
&gt; how does the FAA go about testing new aircraft models with their spin recovery tests? I mean are we talking about computer simulations? Wind tunnel testing? I'm thinking the FAA doesn't exactly have a bunch of expendable test pilots at their disposal to see if a plane will pass or not in real world conditions... or do they?  They make the manufacturer do it.

According to Wikipedia/TV by the Numbers, the first episode of Constantine had 7.14 million viewers, once you added in the DVR numbers. Those numbers were trickling away, though.  As you say, it wasn't a good fit for NBC, and that probably had a lot to do with it, but it was never a particularly big hit.  By contrast, Supergirl (which is also not a HUGE hit by any means) is pulling in numbers in its 4th episode that are millions more than Constantine's first.   Also, if I had to guess, and it is just a guess, I would say that there were more fans of the Constantine MOVIE watching the show than there were fans of the comic books, considering the books sell in the tens of thousands, rather than millions.

We recently had a security audit and the idea of device control was brought up to us and we currently have no method to track and or control devices.  They said they had looked at meraki previously and I gave that a shot and it just doesn't work that great. Our company has an app that we eventually want to take out of the app store and push through some deployment with whatever client we go with.  We want to be able to know what's installed and if our app is installed, the current version of it and whatever extra info we can get.  Meraki was nice but didn't really track if an app had been deleted well enough.

Well, the only people in my family that know is my close family (parents and siblings). And so far, they don't judge me, in fact my mom acually likes it! My sister is a fan as well and my brother knows how we fangirl about it. My family are supportive of my obsession so far! :)

I think you are a little confused. Liberalism is generally concerned about the rights of the individual. Conservatism is about the community having dominance over the individual.

The throwout bearing probably came out of the pressure plate. Your car has a pull-type clutch where the throwout bearing snaps into the fingers on the pressure plate and pulls away from the engine to release the clutch. (The slave cylinder pushes the top of the clutch fork forward, the clutch fork pivots on a bar, and the forked end moves toward the rear of the car, pulling the throwout bearing back and releasing the pressure on the clutch disc). If any of the fingers on the PP are broken or the clutch has been ridden, the throwout can come out and the clutch can't be disengaged.  You might be able to fix this by simply pushing the top of the clutch fork toward the back of the car to force the throwout back toward the pressure plate,  but the interface between the two is probably worn out and will come apart again.  
because he exists.
The sheriff gave me my first job to help out the buffalo rancher in town. Problem is, I killed the rancher and half his buffalo for the Indians just a few minutes ago. I'm scared.  edit: lol I got away with it since there was technically no job to be done, with him and his cattle dead and all. My second job is to do something with the Beefhead Bulls…except I already killed them all for the hell of it. Oh well, more free clues for me.  edit2: nope, he won't let me get past the Bulls mission. Neither will the oil guy, of whom I figured out how to make talk. I decided to kill the sheriff since he wouldn't be useful to me anyways. Considering he said he was only outmatched by the killer in shooting speed, he didn't even pull out his gun against me, just got shot point blank. I then got really bored since I was killing all the bad guys but couldn't get any clues, so I went back to Clintville and murdered most/all of its outside civilians, accidentally summoning a "Horde Mode" by doing so. Basically they get waves of people trying to kill you and you've got to try to survive for as long as possible. Apparently Horde Mode is one of the endings.  edit3: oh…you can buy new lives, now I understand what the lady was saying. I thought it was just changing the costume.  edit4: finally managed to kill the guy in one of my shorter runs. What I did was try to find any ways for easy hints toward the beginning, and try to primarily target guys who match the description before the rest before the killer can run away. I found him in the Mines, with no warning from the game that he may be there. He was in a group of bandits that don't automatically start shooting until you provoke them. He was the only one with a light brown hat and light brown pants, and his belt looked silverish, I got lucky I guess. The screen just fades to black fairly slowly and it says "The End". Though you can presumably only get 5 stars from exploring and killing more, with more money and lives left over.

FYI. It's both. The logo is also an artistic expression, even just the second half of it with orange background on the word hub. Sure, you aren't going to get as much in damages for it. But it's copyright infringement.
Idk why u are getting down voted for asking a question.I would like to know the answer to this also.
I'm trying to find a way to bring it up. Again.  I feel like a broken record but it's been 2 years since the last time words were... yelled. We've had slightly more sex than last year, but I'm sad and scared bringing it up will shoot us backward. I don't want to hurt his feelings because I love him.  But I'm trying to dance a feelings dance and those never end up well. I think I just need to go for it, but I need the words to be tactful.

Yep. We sure forced those guys to pick up guns and dawn suicide vests didnt we? Regardless of blunders fighting Iraqi insurgents, their growth after our withdrawl was due in no small part to (actually mostly due to) Obama and his negligence of the problems facing Iraq post -withdrawl. And because people decided to become militants all on their own.
If you notice on i305 after the first few weeks or so they added water sprinklers (that sprayed directly on the running wheels) on the 'waiting' area before entering the station, and in the station as well.  The first few weeks each train was out of service at least once a day, and workers could be seen working on the undercarriage/wheel area of the trains.  And there were large amounts of wheels in the service area.  Nothing official was ever said (of course) but the assumption was that the wheels were pretty much getting thermal failure due to the extended speeds/Gs at an alarming rate.  As i'm told the wheels are not cheap, and something had to be done.  The sprinklers were not helping enough even after slowing down the cable lift speed near the top of the ride (before the trims were added on the drop you could see the train barely crawling over the hill), so they added the trims as a stop-gap, and reprofiled the ride on the off season.  If you check the kdfansite forums in the i305 thread from the first season you can see all the drama unfold, all the info about it.  However, there's a bunch of BS to sort through.
&gt; You should just stick to your own conversations instead of just randomly popping in...  Are you threatening to censor me with some sort of autoblocker?
Are you a single mother? If so that would probably be the reason. I manage over 100 apartments and have had thousands of tenants and I've never had a positive experience renting to a single mother. Always issues, always excuses with why they can't pay the rent, always want to break their leases early, complaints from neighbors about the kids, complaints from the mother that her newborn is being kept up by neighbors... Always a horrible experience.   White or Asian women without kids are usually the best tenants. Usually pay rent and keep the place clean. Friendly to deal with and accommodating for apartment showings. Gay men have also typically been a pleasure to deal with.   Men are worse than women, generally speaking. Usually more destructive and slightly less likely to pay rent. Can sometimes be a pain in the ass when conducting tour of their apartments. Still much better than single mothers. 
juding by all the turds who ignore objectives to just sit at the back of the map to try to shoot and get kills then call out your "Bad" K|D when you ask them to push the objective and not worry about their epeen, yes. 
Try them on Facebook! I've had every problem I've ever had with Sephora solved that way when no one else was able to.
There are telepaths in Watchmen and Manhattan seems to be doing fine. The whole understanding all time and experiencing it all at once would fuck up any telepath that tried to gain entry to his mind. Its like an eldtritch abomination, humans simply cant handle or comprehend things like that.
Oh yeah he benched himself cuz he was pissed that PJax gave the last shot to kukoc right. Still, this is pretty subjective but Idk if MJ and Pip had that auroa of Justice League/Avengers/Paul McCartney n John Lennon/Randy&amp;Curt kind of stuff- Pip was the greatest Robin ever, but somewhat missing the "flair" to be that superhero. 
Love it.  It's coming soon. At least you know it's recorded and in the editing phase.

They got so bored of the Gotham without Batman thing.  It doesn't make any sense either. If these villains are out and about and being taken on by Gordon, what's the point of Batman even existing? 
you forgot season 6 of Portlandia on IFC

Going with 2 holding midfielders against some of the weaker teams is downright criminal. We are better than that

There are two IKEA in Ireland (Belfast and Ballymun) and a third was [refused planning permission](https://www.newstalk.com/reader/47.301.343/24459/0/) in Cherrywood last year. Before them, there was a constant stream of people going to Glasgow and Warrington who woulf ship a pallet home for very reasonable rates.
There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RCSources/comments/3ros31/usa_6apb_from_scientificinnovationcom/) that gives me the impression the jury is still out.
Not at all. 
It was a rather dull show. I mean come on they had almost two weeks to prep for it.
&gt; Just don't use those fuckers on your neck to remove a dick that someone had drawn on me in class  That's bad but as an adult, I went out with two girls to a bar in South America, they were buying and I didn't have cash, they fought, the girl with cash left, the other left to get cash, so I waited and fell asleep at the table.  Got home and found a huge dick in ink painted on my head.  I'm writing this because you're the only other person I know who had a dick drawn on their head/neck.  We could start a club.  
Its surprising how many people have seen mr regulars face, the first time i saw it was a toyota echo maintenance video that was posted on another channel (cant remember what was being fixed)

The first gulf war? Ending a genocide. The conflict in Kosovo? Ending a genocide. Operation Ocean Shield? Ending piracy of the coast of Somalia. Somali Civil war? Protecting thousands of civilians in Somalia.  There are a lot of controversial conflicts the US military gets involved in, but by and large we reduce instability and improve quality of life around the world.  I know a lot of people have the opposite experience, but on average  it is better to have the US military fighting these wars because most of the people that are saved couldn't do it themselves.
&gt;Approximately 20% of women in college are sexually assaulted during their time at school.  first statement was ludicrous so i had to look it up. apparently the source is a white house press release. lol. how stupid is that? then it goes on to say that the press release was based on a study by the justice department. so i read that [study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf). within the first paragraph of the introduction this is what it it says exactly  &gt;Based on their findings, Bonnie Fisher and her colleagues estimate that the women at a college that has 10,000 female students could experience more than 350 rapes a year— a finding with serious policy implications for college administrators.  first of all, it is only an estimate. second what is 350/10000? that doesnt look like 1 in 5 to me. now i doubt it is even that high but i'm not going to bother diving deeper to see how the research was done. feminism is always based on false facts to boost their moral stance. i dont even know how these women live with themselves constantly spewing horseshit. it's unbelievable. how can they keep a straight face and keep their strength up to argue and argue, knowing full well it's a lie. jesus christ. what is this world coming to?   edit: i propose the most effective ways to prevent college campus rape is to go back to separate sex schools. then we'll see how successful the male schools are and how shitty the female ones are. lol. i wonder what they'll come up with to cry about then. what's left to blame? go all the way back to kindergarten saying boys didn't let girls play with legos or some stupid shit? force companies to hire from women colleges?

This kind of tech has already been in use for line of sight point to point connections for a long time. This is just another one of those new "bullshit futurestic it will change the world and solve world hunger you should buy into it asap" things.  .  What I would rather see is some small part of the 500 - 900 MHZ  bands allocated for long range lower speed wifi for use in niche applications. Though this presents othe problems with interference, and you know it will never happen anyways because it would make paid cell phone service almost completely redundant when it comes to internet access.

Alchemic Muse Laguna might be an alright replacement for MDA Mermaid. The notes are similar, they're *aromatic cyclamen, water lily, and muguet blossoms floating on sea foam greens and salty air anchored by exotic, sun-bleached driftwood.*. I have it and really like it. It's my favorite summer scent.   For MDA Aphrodite... maybe Solstice Scents Rose Mallow Cream? The notes are *Moroccan Rose absolute, Bulgarian Rose absolute, Marshmallow Fluff, Strawberry Nectar, White Chocolate, Vanilla, White Musk.*

I am told that if I go into litigation in Australia, I can easily enforce the mandate in the asset country. And I'm told that the country doesn't recognize or enforce ~~foreign contracts~~ foreign arbitration awards.   I wasn't given any particular readings to go off of. I just have the ICC rules of arbitration in my course pack.  EDIT: Meant foreign arbitration awards.
I just switched to this job about 6 months ago. There was some leftover credit card debt on there from college (been working on it a few years) and I put a few thousand back on it. Honestly, I bought a house and lost my job a month later so about 5k of that is moving expenses I had intended on paying back that next month with my quarterly bonus.

Elder Cipher gave amazing rewards, but the elemental weapons weren't really something to hunt after. I recommend collecting all 3 to those who haven't yet, though I am unsure if you can get the bounty now. It might only be legacy engrams.  We see most of HoW perks being recycled in Y2, as is ToO. I'd argue HoW had the most influence on TTK than any other expansion. Maybe if Skolas had given the fallen perks on the weapon for free like Adept ToO in Y2, people would have cared more.

Well, we're sons of the pygmy, so I would assume we can't be corrupted like Artorias. The only reason we need the ring is so we can stand in the void, instead of falling through it. Manus has solid ground to stand on, so we don't need to worry about it.

Someone has an unusual taste in style, I can't imagine myself sitting in that chair and those god awful stairs, I have enough trouble with normal stairs.  At best, that fireplace should be in a corner surrounded by ceramic tiling, bricks or cement.  Not even sure that design would be approved by many architects.

I don't know how I feel about this. When I had my iPhone repaired, they asked me several times if I had a backup. They then had me sign something that basically said Apple is only responsible for the hardware during the repair and not any data. Luckily I got the phone back good as new.

I'm aware, I had to deal the stupid rules of FAFSA myself unfortunately. I was exaggerating for comedic effect in an attempt to bring your argument to an amusing conclusion.   But back on topic, I had to put off college for multiple years because my parents refused to file me as independent, because they got more money back each year even though I lived in a different state and had no contact with them. I worked driving forklifts on third shift, reading books and struggling to live paycheck to paycheck. Essentially my life was a waiting room, and given we all have finite time on this world it was torturous. I felt my time slipping through my fingers with no recourse, so I waited. Meanwhile, everyone I knew finished school and started families.  On the topic of age, Isaac Newton did his most prolific work at 27, Einstein, 25. Am I going to contribute to the world in the same way they did? No probably not, but very few solutions come in the form of putting it off until a later date. That to me looks very much like a band-aid in lieu of finding a solution.

Do you have any friends with older or very, very chill dogs? I also like the therapy dog idea.  
This is literally on the front page of /r/nfl right now.  OP, surely you saw that before you decided to repost?  Did you read the article?  They actually praise the Panthers a lot, but saying you're not as good as the 2007 Patriots is hardly an insult.

Join a local Toastmasters club, or something similar - this will give you some great experience talking in front of strangers, and, over time, help give you more confidence speaking.   If you've made it this far working your way through college, you have the drive and the passion for the field you've chosen - now you just need to focus some of your learning efforts on the "whole picture" part of what is needed to get the job done. The fact that you recognize you need to work on that is the first step, and now you can put some of your efforts into building that skill (pun intended!). Best of luck in your pursuit of a career in the construction industry.

As a student who is working her fucking ass off over 15 hours a week (and most my friends do more AND have more credit hours than me), Bernie's firm stance on free schooling is really the only real inspiration I have left in me to finish school. I don't have a day off, I work literally seven days a week (school 5 days, work 2 days, sometimes there's overlap). I'm exhausted all the time. I don't have time to do the things I love, let alone exercise and keep my physical health. Don't even get me started on my mental health. All this and I'm still leaving school with over 20,000 in debt. I don't even want to finish. I really just don't care anymore. But at the same time, finishing my education will... I don't know. make me smarter or whatever.   Keep fighting Bernie, so kids like me can be excited to get educated.. and not so depressed and detained in debt

It's not about religion. We've built a free society tied to *no* religion and most of us are fairly happy with it the way it is. If a group feels that their code of rules is more important than our laws, they are a liability. Recall the clerk who refused to marry gay couples for Christian reasons: she doesn't deserve the job she had, and if a few thousand of her wanted to immigrate to our country and join our work force, I would politely say "no thanks."

I do like the content in the game, it just lacks content. I never said that the games content is bad. I've currently got 28 hours in the game and the maps get tedious and boring after replaying them over the 28 hours, it doesn't have the feel and excitement that it had when you first booted it. It's gotten to the point where you can predict who wins the round on walker assault and supremacy. Maybe I should take a break from battlefront.

Years ago when I had a dating profile I made sure to make it short since people like the TL;DR but right at the top and again at the end I noted I would not date someone who had kids or wanted them. I got so many messages from single fathers it was absurd. All that says to me is that the person doesn't really care for their child because why would you date someone who doesn't like children if you have one?

A plan is much smaller than the internet. You can do OSC and real time audio over LAN just fine. Major stadium sound systems use Ethernet for audio all the time.  This isn't the same thing as transmitting to the other side of the planet through hundreds of nodes and thousands and thousands of miles. The speed of light becomes a major delay factor in as short as hundred miles.

&gt; Fuck your pussy-ass state-sponsored censorship. Grow up.  Fuck you for expecting us to let in everyone and anyone just because of your fee fees. Grow up if you're crying about us telling one cunt to fuck off.  &gt;Not my country. My country has free speech and due process -- neither of which were afforded to a fucking radio host who was called "dangerous".  You seem to have a loose grip on reality. Refusing entry to someone violates neither his right to free speech nor his right to due process. The right to free speech is not lost by a country refusing someone entry: he used his free speech, and the UK government reacted to the way he used free speech. No ones rights have been violated, there is no censorship, there is no obligation on a sovereign nation to accept anyone through its borders.  And just as the list isn't a list of terrorists it isn't a list of 'dangerous' individuals either, just individuals we've refused entry to.  I'm pretty sure if you compare the number of people the U.S. refuses entry to to the number of people the U.K. refuses  you'll find the U.S. refuses more by orders of magnitudes.  &gt;The ban list for non-criminals is simply a tool for censorship.   Have we censored him? Narp. In terms of free speech a ban list for criminals is no different from a ban list for non-criminals, whether you've restricted someone's speech or not is not determined by whether or not they're a criminal.
Hence the charges. Annnd we've gone full circle!

Have you experimented with making non alcoholic versions? I mean, I know it's not the same... But could be fun to try! And thanks lol, people have so many mixed views / opinions on pregnancy and drinking... And we're pregnant and should be happy about this little person right? Not dying for our next alcohol hit! But this pregnancy thing is weird and scary and terrifying and a million other really really hard, stressful things and DAMNIT, I WANNA DRINK!!! So so glad I'm not the only one!

That sound like it makes more sense. I wonder if the gay angle was at least part of the reason that this case never really made a lot of headlines. After all, this was the 80s. Jose disappeared the same year that the AIDS epidemic began, and with it came a lot of fear, paranoia, and hate that sadly exists today. I wonder if it took investigators until 1989 to actually figure out the whole scenario or if they knew all along and were unable to actually charge them until eight years later.

Use a screwdriver and hammer to tap gently counter clockwise on the locking ring to loosen it.  If that doesn't work, use just the hammer to beat the shit out of the locking ring until it loosens, then buy new ones of whatever you broke.  Or you could check you tube for videos if your model number, you might get lucky.
Or ahead..
Isn't it *easier* to relate to people who also like women? :D

This is a problem that has been solved for several years. It's why "cloud" offerings became s thing, in large part.  See AWS Elastic Load Balancing with Auto Scaling. It takes very little time to set up.  They may be failing to architect their systems in a way that scales easily, but Infrastructure is not the issue.
I can really only speak from a planning standpoint, but they have a good reputation.   It's not going to necessarily get you the first job - you'll still need to do internships and get real-world experience, but it's definitely a tie-breaker with someone who just did the same types of internships and no portfolio school. And the connections you make and exposure you get to real briefs and situations will definitely help you during the networking/interview stage of the job search.
Of course!
He probably tunneled you, too.
I just thought it was an odd choice. There are plenty of richer, more powerful and especially more good-looking people than tarantino. Why pick him?
Well you could buy the rekordbox DJ addon and use the DDJ-SX with rekordbox. There's a free trial if you want to give that a shot before making any decisions.   And it's fairly common for clubs to have CDJs in the booth and it's not unheard of for them to ban the use of controllers for various reasons. That said, you could still use CDJs with Serato and a laptop through either DVS or HID if you wanted to. 
We're **BRAYAN THE PAIN**
Polygamy was very common throughout the world (either in the form of multiple wives, or the form of one wife and multiple concubines), but it was basically unheard of in ancient European cultures.  (It wasn’t uncommon for men to have extramarital romantic liaisons, but with women who were more like mistresses or prostitutes than concubines.) It’s not clear exactly why, but it seems part of it is the more egalitarian culture these societies had in their early days, such that every man had a plot of land, served in the army, and married a girl when he was secure.  You can’t have men with many wives without having many men with *no* wives, and this is best suited to an economic situation where some people are wealthy and most are servants.  In Old-Testament-style herding cultures, for example, a big chief might have enough sheep, cattle, and camels to support four wives and thirteen children, whereas men at the bottom of the totempole with zero sheep, zero cows, and zero camels can support zero wives and zero children.  As Greek and Roman culture became more unequal an aristocracy did develop, but they still were only allowed one wife (now with the additional restriction that they could only have marry an *aristocratic* woman).  With monogamy so deeply ingrained, emperors who went to unheard-of excesses of personal self-indulgence still tended to marry one woman at a time.  Christianity had a hostility towards sex even from early days and there was no way Christians, once they became a large presence in the Greco-Roman world, were going to attract the contempt of their neighbors by defending Biblical polygamy.  In the early 1500s, when the early Protestant reformers were revisiting *all* Christian rules/practices which lacked Biblical sanction, the reformers did *consider* permitting polygamy (on exactly the grounds you suggest, that it is praised frequently in the Bible and never banned), and at a certain point they were pro-polygamy while they were still very anti-divorce, and one Protestant prince *did* take a second wife.  However, the backlash to this was so severe that the reformers recognized the unpopularity of polygamy and stopped suggesting it be brought back (although it has recurred in heretical sects, most famously Mormonism).
Hawk sauce for sure!

Sooooo 30/M/6'1"  SW 265lbs/ CW 265lbs/ GW 200lbs  I've bounced around between being in and out of shape all throughout my 20's.  Ill typically do really well, pleateau, and abandon the good habits for all the bad ones that I had to work so hard to undo!  This time around, I'd really like to get back down to what I weighed when I graduated high school(or maybe a little more depending on how much muscle I develop.)  I am getting married next fall, and having engagement pictures made really hit me hard.  I knew I had let myself go, but never like this.  I'd like the next round of pictures I take to be ones I can be happier with.  So far, I have made alterations in my nutritional intake, cut back on alcohol, and have begun doing crossfit classes.  I plan on continuing to build good habits in as I progress, as in the past I had a tendency to try and do everything all at once and it was a guaranteed crash and burn scenario.  So I'm happy to have a plan that I can stick to and a foundation that I can build on.  Sorry, long post.  Just nice to see it all typed out on a screen.   edit*** I wish I was only 165!

Agreed.  I just didnt feel like explaining it all the way.  But now that you brought it up, what I meant was, once you've acquired titans, 1 hunter - there is not benefit that outweighs a Warlock revive for the remainder of the 3 spots.  Unless of course, you have a pro regular team, at which point none of this matters.  The post would alleviate all of it, by simply never factoring it in.

I actually met someone similar. She has a B.S. in Geology and was starting a Masters in science education last I heard, but she's a die-hard Young Earth creationist.

I wouldn't necessarily use the term "suspicious" but I agree. This general critical nature is at the heart of the process by which we validate or historical discoveries, though, so there shouldn't really be a reason to promote critical bias when that critical bias should be standard. I was talking about this particular phrasing where you discount the rest of the account because one fact is inconsistent. This habit is just as dangerous as, and feels like it would often co-exist with, assuming a whole account is true because of one confirmed fact. Instead, we should take what confirmed evidence as we have it and remain skeptical, *but not dismissive* of the rest, just like we should've been thinking of that data before the discrepancy was found.  Also, many accounts in the Bible have also proven true or been based on true events and true historical data. The Bible has been invaluable at providing input on how people lived back then and the cultures and kingdoms that were active. While I see that plenty of facts in the Bible have turned out wrong, I still don't see the positive in presuming historical inaccuracies based on the "reputation" of a direct historical source. It should just serve as a reminder to presume as little as possible and always trust your evidence.
I was under the impression that LP was win based? You get points to level up in your division and eventually go to a new tier. I don't think there was ever any confirmation on it being skill based at all, just theories.

Oh please! The sub had always been about politics.  It has been stupid Tumblr snowflakes and radical gender politics from day 1.  Quality has always been low hanging fruit.  But what changed is it also used to lick EFS's balls and worship him as a king of it all.  Now they don't give a shit who he is and his megalomaniac side can't stand it.  It was always a place for low effort mocking of idiots and a shrine to EFS.  The only thing that's changed is now the community doesn't bow down and pretend you mods are the greatest thing since discovering the TITP lulzcow goldmine.

Conference championship games are a relatively new thing in college football altogether. Conferences were smaller and played a Round Robin schedule.
Ah, thanks for the info. It's always interesting to hear how other countries and cultures view pets. Strays and outdoor cats are both common where I am from, and it's odd to think there are places in the world where an unknown cat showing up on your doorstep is unusual. Even the difference of rural US vs. urban US can be quite striking. In my neighborhood, feeding the neighborhood cats isn't really charity. It's more of a trade of kitty cuddle time for food - a fair exchange!
Uh... Reasons. 
Wow this so sounds like my life but instead of being the wronged husband I'm the wronged wife. Emotional affairs are just as damaging as physical ones, I'm trying hard to trust my SO again but it's very very hard 
The two are not remotely comparable, and I say this as someone who largely agrees with you.  It's ridiculous to claim that Christians own Dear, when we haven't learned a great deal about his motives, and we're pretty damn sure he literally was just a crazy old hermit. Meanwhile, ISIL (besides *literally standing for* the "Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant") is CLEARLY related to Islam, and *is* interpreting Koranic scripture pretty damned literally as to establishing a global caliphate, charging non-Muslims the *jizya* if they submit to Sharia rule, etc.
IPv6 isn't really bandwidth constrained though, large blocks are. There is such thing as reasonable testing. We had the technology to run IPv6 for years at scale(we just didn't have enough adoption), we don't have the technology to run 8GB blocks at scale currently.

The m4's are perfectly capable of close combat. They do it pretty well they just get inferior ammo. at close range that inferiority is somewhat offset due to fast reload time and the penetration of the ammo. Its doesnt kill easily but it disables well enough.  Try it and learn how to use it and then try to figure out why the m4 gets a single ammo type that is worth a damn. 
I'm amused and happy that Nocturnals are right up there in the playable castes!   Alchemicals and Dragonblooded would probably still exist, but count as "creatures of darkness." If you wanted, you could go with the idea of "Dragons of a different Color" that I've seen before, where they are focused on the elements of Malfeas rather than Gaia.

First, you weren't evicted -- you were given notice to pay and you chose to skip out. Essentially, you evicted yourself. Had you stayed and not paid your rent, after 5 days your landlord would have initiated the court case to have you evicted. Had you stayed and paid your rent, your landlord would not have been able to to evict you.   Second, yes, your rent for the full term can be accelerated because you skipped out. If and when your landlord rents the unit out, they'll have to refund you for that portion of the rent -- you'll remain responsible for the months the unit was unoccupied.

You could put em as buttons right next to "Feed", same style.   I think, though, that Monsters should not attack a "staying" or "returning" pet, but once the pet finishes returning, it begins hunting and can be attacked.  Since the monster generation can happen in any room, stay would be useless if monsters could attack the pet during that time.  Edit: I'm a moron, are these already implemented?
Anyone mind pointing out the location of Dabiq on this map? As IS starts losing ground near it, attacks on western targets will only intensify as they try to pull the "crusader armies" into a ground fight while they still control the city.

Reiterating this: don't put it off. The quicker you deal with situations like this, the less painful the consequences. I know it doesn't *feel* like that is the truth; it feels far less painful and easier to continue to put it off. But putting it off will only exponentially increase the difficulty.   Additionally, the sooner you take care of this, the fewer financial penalties will be leveled in your direction. The longer it gets put off, the more this will cost you. Best of luck. And as others have said in this thread, we all make mistakes. You will move above and beyond this in no time. 
Scariest hit I've seen since I've been watching football. I'm just glad he's okay.
For a lot of little reasons. No dual controls on most, most had a much worse instrument layout, the good ones cost more than the good Mooney M20F examples, fear of partner over the costs to maintain, fear of wife over "the doctor killer".  And finally, and most importantly, I had already done a ton of research on the gotchas of a Mooney and didn't want to invest the same effort into another make/model without a reasonably good example already found

[I came very close to being trapped on the roof with two other men](http://www.thesudburystar.com/2013/08/28/fire-at-clarabelle-mill).   I was on my way out (half way down seven flights of stairs) after finishing my work when I saw smoke forming below me in the stairwell. I ran through it and was able to get outside safely. If my job had taken me one more minute I would have been trapped on the roof with those other men. Apparently they had to lie down in the gravel of the roof just to be able to breathe. 
Is it harder to be 1-19 or 0-20?
Yep, same here. Time it all so you butter the toast right out of the toaster, and so the egg goes on right after you butter the toast....cook some bacon first and fry the eggs in a bit of the grease, and you have the perfect meal IMO
We have a couple who comes in once a week and wants a side of tomatoes sliced VERY THIN and pays full salad price for it. $8. Personally, I think they have too much money.
ok, I wasn't sure if it was a simple multiplication of days or if the damage was a function of how quickly you took the dose. so, I'm not exactly sure what type of radiation the inhabitants of Ramsar are being exposed to.  however, they do state that the peak value was recorded at 131 mSv/a (I think the 'a' is per annum aka year).  since the average is 10Gy/a, I think the QF is likely 10. .   so here is what I came up with for dose comparison:  - Fukushima reactor, the dose is 683mSv/a - Ramsar town average dose is: 100mSv/a - 2 miles from Fukushima reactor: 5.6mSv/a

Easy bro, it's okay. You don't have to be an escort. Hell, you don't even have to be a drug dealer.  Doing anything illegal would only hurt your chances of getting another job, a legal one. You've got plenty of choices, man-- it's just a matter of choosing which one to make.   From my point of view the best thing you could probably do is wait for that evaluation. Maybe you could find some family, friends, or other roommates to crash with until you can get that evaluation, maybe a part time, low stress job (like working at a store or something) to get some money coming in. There may be some welfare programs or the like you can look into, too. I'll link if I find any.  I know that might not be much help, but you definitely don't need to be an escort or a drug dealer. : )

We certainly understand.  We tried to use their internal system for listening to Google messaging with hangouts, but it gave us a security exception and crashed the app anytime we attempted to register, so for now it looks like we have to pass them through to the notification center for you to get them.  We're keeping our eyes open for new systems we can use with Android L to handle hangouts better for you, though!  And in the meantime, like SmarmySnail said, the notification center filter is your friend.  :)
hi there,  i'm also interested in the same product i saw on Amazon.  i also wanted to find out about the company, xmartO, since there is not much out there on them.  their website doesn't give much information about them either, but i did find out they are registered in Hong Kong, and they filed for trademark on 09/18/15, so they are definitely a new company: http://www.trademarkia.com/xmarto-86760653.html  best, yen

You know it's there, you know the power it gives you, and your negative emotions are amplified. I'm not surprised someone like Hook - who's always had difficulty leaving his past ways behind him - gets a bit pushed over the edge when he remembers what's lurking in him.  Compare it to that time when he briefly had his hand returned - he was told it would bring out the darkness in him, and having believed that, Hook acted darkly and went around beating Will up - even though he realised afterwards that it wasn't the hand that caused him to do that, it was his own weak will. He's so afraid of returning to his dark ways that when something gives him an excuse to, he hits rock bottom again and delves right in, believing he has no control over the situation because he's always seen himself as a villain.  Whereas someone like Emma already had light magic, already had the title of saviour and had people who loved her, all Hook had was Emma and a stained past. So when she betrayed him by making him a Dark One, he just falls right into it. Back in Storybrooke though, he wasn't aware of the extra Darkness lurking within him and also wasn't aware of Emma's betrayal - remembering all that at once doesn't just come with imagery, but the forgotten emotions as well, hence all of his sudden anger and hatred within the space of a few seconds.

that sux.  IMHO if friends can't call you an ass for cheating on your gf and get over it ... they are not good friends to begin with.  Unless they like the GF more than you and they were her friends too...  then I can see some of them siding  with her.  Of course... I am of the opinion you may have deserved losing all your friends for being a dick.  If you had told your then GF that it was over and THEN gone and jumped the friend, that I would be fine with...  But it sounds like all you did do was have a fight and then jump into bed with another ... that is being a dick.  Grow up. and learn to respect people and you may not have all these childish problems when you mature.
Forget the oil.  Turkey, as a Nato member, are doing what the US wants them to do - antagonise Russia as much as possible.  If Russia succeeds in abandoning the dollar, she and China will sail off into the sunset while the US collapses. So the US intends to use all its vassals as cannon fodder. UK and France are next.

My uncle's dog once jumped out of a second story window trying to run away once. When he went to look out the window he discovered the dog had thrown a water bowl and a couple of toys into the tree branches right next to the window. We think that it was testing to see if they tree was load bearing while plotting its escape.

i had never thought of medicine and racial justice as being speculative, but i get where they're coming from, i think. i'd be interested to see the reading list for the class. 
Most college degrees don't require much advanced math apart from something like an intro calc course, but if anyone ever has a chance to get into the harder courses even just as an elective I'd recommend taking an Abstract Algebra course. The way I usually describe the course to people is that it's math without the numbers. It's the study of set theory, which can generically be applied to any type of object. You don't need to deal with sets of numbers, your sets could be made up of people, or types of food, or whatever. You learn the rules of how objects are organized and how different groups can relate to each other.
* In Options, you can turn on damage numbers and Advanced Tooltips, which shows you exactly how much damage you do.  * Disintegrate is currently bugged on Live, doing considerably higher damage than it should. AFAIK, this is fixed in the PTR.  * Unfortunately, you cannot unlock higher difficulty levels until you beat the game and/or reach max level.

Do you think you're being treated fairly? Trump: "I have no opinion but people think I'm treated unfairly.  Here's an example of one of the ways I'm being treated unfairly.  But I have no opinion about it.   Lol, what a slime ball.   And then he goes on to identify with or at least apologize for the Planned Parenthood shooter's feelings.  Sickening.

She probably had to pay a really top-notch lawyer to get even that much money out of a public university.   Also, she was demoted at her next job because it came out that she was a victim of Manning's.   Plus, therapy, psychiatrists, and prescriptions are expensive. You don't know what kind of treatment she has had and possibly continues to have, just so she can feel safe, while she continues to work in a similar environment. That's not something the average person has to spend money on. Maybe she even needed some time off.   Those are just the expenses related to the incident that I can think of off the top of my head.

I definitely gain fat. But not as significant an amount that you seem to be implying. Usually I would agree with you 100% but maybe I'm just the outlier here. I'm not trying to avoid fat gain because I'm trying to bulk at least 20 more pounds. I also play ice hockey twice a week for at least 2 hours each skate, which burns an insane amount of calories. I tried eating 3,000 and I just leaned out. I tried eating 3,500 and I still leaned out just not as much. So I bumped it up to 4,000 and then started making significant gains in muscle as well as fat, but that's to be expected when bulking.   I'm 5'11" and weigh ~200 pounds. I've been working out seriously for just over year but didn't actually figure out how to bulk up until about March and since then I've made incredible progress. I attribute most of it to beginner gains but I do a lot of research and feel confident that I'm heading in the right direction.   I'll let you know if that's still the case when I attempt to cut for the first time :p
I had that happen.  I got a file and filed the tiny lip on the inside edge of the spacebar and the issue went away.  You have coastar stabilizers, I presume?  Also consider lubing the stabilizers with a thick lithium or dielectric grease which might also fix it.

The silly thing is these "foreign-owned" stores are actually American owned stores just owned by brown-skinned Americans.  This isn't a "buy American" argument.  This is a "buy from your fellow white (and Christian) store owners"

Whaa? When did they put that there? That's why it suddenly became unbearable. Grabbing the rotation axis used to be something that would happen if you were in free transform. At some point they added transform controls to the move tool by default and I never noticed the switch because I'm usually in Illustrator, not Photoshop. Thank you. My life is saved.
