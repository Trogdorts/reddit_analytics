Any tips for a male thinking about getting into this business?  I think I'm good enough at writing sex and coming up with variations to be successful at it. But I'm not so sure about fleshing out (so to speak) my female characters in terms of their background and motivation. I am concerned that it will be obvious that it's written by a man.  I assume writing under a female pseudonym would be best, but does this mean that I need a whole persona for social media? Could I get away with a gender neutral author name?  Thanks for your advice in all the other posts, I've learned a lot from this.
Hey I would love to spectate some of your games sometime to see how you play.  I'm at level 27 summoner right now so it's not too big of a deal but I would love to learn and improve on my support play.

Haha don't worry I know. I wasn't going to warn amazon or anything! 
Are you kidding me? That quick clip was played at close to if not the lowest graphical settings possible. I've never seen a beautiful game in my life? You're talking to the owner of Crysis 2 and 3, Battlefield 3, pre-ordered Battlefield 4, and Arma 3. I can play all of those at high settings and greater.  
Scots are in the British Culture group and have their own NIs. They're British so they can form Great Britain.
They can fly just fine.  There was a problem with getting oxygen to the pilot but that issue has been resolved.  I still don't think there is much point in using them though.
They are definitely stigmatised for their mental illness. Though I don't see why you would expect anyone to be comfortable with pedophilia. It's not some Victorian fuddy-duddy conservative mindset, it's our natural paternal instinct to protect children.  The very concept of 'mental illness' is an abstract concept, and I don't see why the explicit desire to fuck children would not fall under it.

Not sure how to feel...Hopefully it's just early game jitters.

Yep. Just you.
Police tend to view people wearing bulky clothing as being potentially armored, you have no idea what they have on under that. So naturally they use a high powered weapon if they might have to shoot someone who could be armored. Luckily he had a perfect opportunity for a head shot (only one pellet missed Gale's head, and the hostage had pulled away slightly)

&gt; Can someone explain why the US government always says they will 'do what is in the best interest of the United States' when they should be doing that is in the best interest of the world.  It is the limited job of our Congress to do what is in the best interest of he United States, and the United States alone. This doesn't mean staying out of foreign affairs, it means what is in it for the U.S. Maybe it is mutually beneficial.  Too often they act in the best interests of a small section of the U.S., and against the interests of the entirety.

I'm a deputy as well but I work the street. My question is how do you not beat the shit out of these people? I've ran across some in my 15 years on the street and now my supervisors won't let me around any of them as they're in fear I may go postal on them. I just have zero tolerance for a kid toucher.

Yeah, the response to that should be a sob story of your own about needing more money.
Entirely possible. It was that way for me, when I was very young (6-7), and also for my best friend, who fits the stereotypical Asian family - You must play! Play! Ask through school and university. He hasn't picked his viola up since.  It *is* a common theme, instrument practice being a chore.   Mine has passed, thankfully. Enough water has passed under the bridge, such that I am only responsible to me.
Agreed. 
The point I was making exactly :P Like, for starters, why would you make an anvil if you already have one. Just use it up 'til it's all gone.
Cosmology is absolutely a science. (Well, I suppose this depends on your definition of "science" but based on my intuitive idea of what constitutes a science, cosmology definitely qualifies.) I find it very strange that someone even slightly knowledgeable would suggest otherwise, since cosmology is just as rigorous and verifiable as any other branch of physics. Cosmologists work closely with experimental astrophysicists to check their theories against experimental evidence, including the behavior of the cosmic microwave background, the recessional velocity of faraway galaxies, the distribution of matter in the universe, and so on.  Wikipedia evidently groups together "physical cosmology" and "religious cosmology" in the same [article about cosmology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology), which I think is rather misleading. Religious cosmology, which is a branch of theology, has little or nothing to do with physical cosmology, which is a branch of physics. (Perhaps this is what the professor you talked to had in mind) Needless to say, in my first paragraph when I say "cosmology" I mean what Wikipedia calls "physical cosmology," explicitly excluding religious cosmology.
No, you don't generally get punched in the military as it's a violation of human rights. Believe it or not but the staff are fucking terrified of getting reported for shit. They often mention it as they delve out some shit punishment.   "BACK IN MY DAY WE'D HOG TIE YOU AND LET YOU DROWN A LITTLE BIT IN THE SHOWERS FOR THIS SHIT, YET HERE YOU ARE BITCHING ABOUT DOING THIRTY PUSHUPS"  One time they did hint that we should beat a kid after lights out since he fucked up so often we all kept getting punished. But real life isn't Full Metal Jacket we just told him to get his shit together.
They really can't. I root for them everytime to no avail. I was hoping they'd at least make a wild card, but they just can't quite get the momentum.
He pitched a great game today.  I've never seen him do as well as he has the last few games he's pitched.  He's now got a 2.88 era and that's great.  I hope he can keep it up.

You sound like a caring and concerned friend. In all honesty, it's not your place to help Russ, he may have to seek help from professionals. Just remember the reason why you didn't want to keep in touch with him after high school - you aren't like-minded and he has ulterior motives. Keep a good crowd of people around you, that's all you really need.
No, they're going to sell Gourcuff and Grenier. Simply because they're two players who look like they could really help the team win games.  Seriously, I know that Gomis may never be a world-beater, but if you can't make a splash to get a better target man why would you (potentially) sell him?  Also, Lisandro, one of the most consistent players for this team in the past few seasons. They could probably use him right about now...  The transfer period is almost over and all they're doing is selling their better players (and burying other past performers on the bench -- where's Briand?). This is like Milan selling KPB and buying Matri.
technically that's my point

I did very much mean socialist (read Labor) although it was meant in an ironic manner as opposed to their actual title. The fact that Lang's government reneged on repaying loans to Britain and stopped landlords from evicting defaulting tenants from their properties displays that while his philosophical base may not have been socialist his actions certainly were.  The New Guard was made up of mainly younger men who hadn't served in World War One (the leaders were older). What is known of the Old Guard is that they were very much part of the officer class from the Great War.  You are right that air and sea wing was insignificant. But the fact that it's members were happy to supply their boats and planes to the cause shows the level of commitment (maybe fanaticism) some members had.   While the bulk of the membership was centered around Sydney there were still quite significant pockets in parts of regional and rural New South Wales. Katoomba, Bowral and Armidale all had operational branches.   The New Guard was as much a social organisation as a political one, especially in some parts of Sydney. In effect they tried to harness popular support by fighting with communists and breaking up their meetings and pulling speakers from their soap boxes in The Domian. They also attempted to send a significant number of its members to help fight the bush fires in Cobar (western New South Wales) but with limited success.  When Sir Philip Game sacked the premier Jack Lang, much of the New Guard's rhetoric became redundant, membership declined and they became irrelevant. You have to put the movement in its historical context. In the late 1920's and early 1930's Hitler and Mussolini weren't the tyrants we know them to be today. They were seen by many to legitimate response to the onset of communism. There were a significant number of people in the world who thought the fascist movement to be entirely legitimate (Oswald Mosley in Britain being a prominent example).   However with the sacking of Jack Lang, the onset of Nazism and eventually World War Two the New Guard essentially withered on the vine and became irrelevant. 
Thank goodness! My sister was as far from a bridezilla as they come, but she was still upset when someone wore white to her wedding. That said, she still thinks it's wrong to wear black to a wedding, so what does she know!  If you are going with pink and mint for accessories, I would probably go with a champagne/gold eye (depending on your skin tone), a not outrageous but still notable flicked eyeliner for some sass, pinky/peachy blush (again, skin tone), and a neutral but glossy lip.

Wow. Three things: 1. Saving money is actually defined as a "leakage" from the economy just like overseas bank accounts and exports. 2. If eveyone saved money the economy does the opposite of "grow". Demand i.e. Spending is what drives the economys growth. Weak demand results in things like the great depression. 3. This phenomenon is referred to as the "paradox of thrift" - essentially the paradox is saving is good for you personally but bad at a macro level for the economy.   The comment above would be hilariously misinformed if it wasnt this kind of economic misinformation that got us all into such deep shit.  Edit: I seriously want to know what school taught you those things in your economics courses?
True that.  Funny thing, though...many JRPG characters appear westernized, but the models sometimes retain Asian features, unless the character's specifically modeled on a real-life person.  A lot of the Final Fantasy characters look European, while some of them seem to have Asian eyes...  Pale skin is actually somewhat common among the Japanese and other races in the far east.  In fact, whereas many places in the world find a tan or a "healthy glow" to be an ideal beauty standard, highly pale skin is considered to be the ideal for Japan, kinda like how it was across many places in the world until the later half of the 20th century.
They make mention of this in "Little Green Men" with the hu-man race. Also, Ferenghi raiders who pillaged the Enterprise were most interested in the warp drive, because they are in 'high demand.' There is least one race that isn't warp capable who asks Captain Archer for the secret of warp technology as well.

It feels like we're in for a rough season.  Bad O-line, Hill is looking like Riley Nelson 2.0, and I'm not sure how the defense is going to hold up against quality teams.

Once you're done with the ME series try Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It's made by Bioware as well and it's pretty similar.
the question really should have included "except for yourself"

Anyone got an idea of a spot in Whistler, BC I can catch this game? Can stream on my phone but was hoping for some TV.  In any case, I'm cheating on No Equal with Kokanee right now and enjoyed having multiple people ask us on the hiking trails today if we were Sounders fans because of my ECS shirt.  Hope Columbus enjoys the rain we haven't been getting in SEA!
Y sí, es como la Chewbacca defense. Decir, *después de la década ganada*, que la culpa de la inflación y las trabas a las importaciones es de la dictadura, de Washington, de que los ingleses ocupan las Malvinas y de que Isabel II es reina de Canadá... Como dice Johnie Cochrane: "It doesn't make any sense!"  Edit: grammar
Well technically speaking nothing is implosion resistant, the structural design is significantly more effective than what's been employed in years past. The collapses on 9/11 were caused by the heating and weakening of the structural steal which was protected from by gypsum board and rudimentary fire-proofing which, in the explosion subsequent to the plane crashes, was blown off leaving the steel exposed to heat. The structural steel is protected this time round by 3-7ft thick concrete walls and "explosion-proof" fireproofing. So yeah, its pretty sturdy.  edit: spelling
I normally hate fights where guys gas, but since BOTH gassed in this one it was kind of interesting.
&gt;Secondly, high-school kickers are notoriously bad, often times they will mess a kick up, so this type of kick is utilized pretty often at the H.S. level as a type of damage control.  I could out kick the senior kicker as a sophomore. And I want a football player. They wouldn't take me on the team because I refused to come to practice every day.  Still won the title.
I have Asperger's/HFA and making eye contact is very difficult for me. People have pointed out that I often don't make eye contact, and I've even been bitched at for being rude because of it. I didn't even know it was a problem until recently.  No wonder I don't have any friends. :/ 
No problem, I had a short panic moment and my first thought was to come here.  Didn't see anybody else posting about it and  when I found my solution thought I could reduce someone else's panic moment. ;)
I'm still not sure if the vacuum guy doesn't just send you to Belize. Something in the way this business operates just doesn't add up.

Long crappy week at work, driving home on a Friday night in my (now sold) Evo 7 and stopped at a set of lights. As soon as they were green I flawed it in first/second, grinned like an idiot and then I saw the blue/red flashes. Couple of older cops, one was ok but the other was a real douche, felt obligated to defect my car. Going from extreme joy to extreme 'oh f*ck' in a matter of seconds is the worst feeling.  Defect: police deem the car unroadworthy and sticker the front windscreen, to remove the sticker the car has to be returned to original condition and presented at a vehicle checking station where they go over the whole car with a fine tooth comb (including brake test). If it passes, great. If not, you must fix whatever was wrong, including any additional defects they may find, and return another day.

Bars that didn't have bouncy floors and had beer other than shitty Chinese beer and budweiser. Schools that didn't treat you like shit. Non-Chinese food. A wider variety of people. Not having fireworks going off literally every single fucking night for a year straight. Not being treated (as much) like a rare monkey in the zoo by the locals. Non-Chinese food. Girls who weren't either incredibly traditional or prostitutes. Electricity and water that didn't get shut off randomly for no apparent reason. Non-Chinese food. Fast internet.   Did I mention I missed having good food that wasn't Chinese? 
You're painting women and men, really all relationships, into black and white. They are not. If I was gay, would my best female friend be in the friend zone? Of course not. Just because he and I have different genitalia, and are attracted to the opposite genitalia, does not mean that one of us must be attracted to one another. Attraction goes far beyond "we have parts that fit. We are pretty people. I guess that means we should like each other". Otherwise, people should like their hot siblings or cousins. Works for the lannisters, sure. But not for everyone. Not for most people.   If you genuinely think there is no such thing as a friendzone, I feel sad for you. Have I had feelings for a guy that went nowhere? Certainly. Probably because I didn't tell until after he got over his crush on me. Eventually, we eere always in relationships at opposite times. We kept in contact, talked hobbies and through the years we both realized that we are way too different to ever date or anything, yet have remained good friends. Does that mean I'm not good as a friend? Of course not. It doesn't detract from my value in his life at all. Or vice versa. We just aren't compatible. 
Eh, code's available. Don't be a wuss.
It's more common than you think, but it's hard to tell because of the mask you have to put on in front of others. You're not alone.

1. I think he's overlooked in the comp scene and is in fact very viable. Common reasons for not using him include his xp dependence (he really needs levels in earth spike for it to be any good) as well as his limited mobility (base MS of 290 is pretty terrible).  Lina doesn't have the level problem because her stun is a constant 2 seconds (and her nuking potential is arguably more useful in the current meta).  2. Viper dominates most mids, but batrider and OD are pretty solid against him. Good tinkers can do well against him too, although with the new corrosive skin, the matchup might have changed (march triggers the DoT now).

I was on this [roller coaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertigo_(roller_coaster)) at Kings Island. You sit face-to-face with riders across from you, so when it starts, you are towed up the hill and some people are facing the sky, the others are hanging from the restraint alone. I was the person hanging at 45 degrees.  When we reached the top of the hill, my restraint clicked down 3 notches in about a second.  *click click click*  It was that moment alone that I nearly shat myself.  
Well Moses may be young, but he's hardly young the way you consider most players. Its hard to imagine Chelsea being able to sell him for a large fee, even if he's great this year. They will never have the upper hand in negotiations with their squad.  Meaning, he might be worth 15 next summer, but Chelsea won't be able to get that.  Most loans for older players involve loan-to-buy clauses. I'd say a straight loan at his level of experience is quite rare these days.

&gt;sometimes you do it by lobbying Congress.  I paraphrased what you wrote here.  And how exactly do I have it backwards?  Big businesses get bailed out by the government all the time.  The same cant be said for their small-time competition.  The big businesses can afford to take extreme risks because they know if they screw up too much, they'll just be bailed out.  Small businesses can't afford to take those kinds of risks, and therefore aren't playing on a level playing field.

He didn't have days to throw, the right guard got good contact but then the DT broke free, McCarron had to move to get out of the way, and then try to move up in the pocket, when he does that he has to work a whole new progression to find someone.  When he missed the second block the play was already busted and that DT got a full speed run to hit McCarron from behind.  Right side of the line fucked up *twice* for them to get that sack even when the DT who got it pretty much ran himself out of the play, he gave them a gift on a platter and he *still* got the sack.  McCarron's done this for a while, he knows what he's doing.  When they are getting beat half the time, it fucks up the other half because he's still got to worry about it

The thing is, The Wire has soooo many complex characters who have such strong arcs. Even the ones who go through repeated problems react to it realistically (McNulty's been described as the most real life example of a high functioning alcoholic), and some end up in a completely different path then when they started (Daniels goes from careerist mole, to a moral leader who tries backdooring the bosses. After his evidence room punishment, he learns to balance good police work and what the brass wants. In Season 5 finale, it's the last straw for him and his conscience costs him the job and he ends up a defense attorney). For every character who has that kind of arc on BrBa, there are 10 or 20 on The Wire.  As for Baltimore's struggles, any major city in America can relate. Just like real life, not everything gets fixed all at once, not everyone makes it to the end of the chessboard. The problems in The Wire and real life are systemic, and still exist. Like season 3's tagline says, the rules change, but the game remains the same. At least a few individual pawns found success by either playing the game (Pearlman, Slim Charles, Carcetti) or quitting it (Cutty, Namond, Poot).  With BrBa, I found Walt to be a forced character trope at times, causing all these problems, putting everyone's lives in danger, all so he can get what he wants and the plot moves forward. Almost everything that happens in the series is because of one angry man wanting more money, more territory, building his own empire, keeping Jesse alive and on his side....I wanted him to die deep down since season 3, because he just kept getting away with the most outrageous shit, then doing it all over again and not suffering believable consequences. The show is still good, I just don't enjoy it as much anymore after I started thinking about all this stuff.
It's not impressive at all. [They're obviously incredibly similar](http://i.imgur.com/ZZARW2e.png).
upward grade trends are good so long as it isn't upwards from D's and stuff your freshman year.  Some universities are more lenient towards your freshman year than others though...
Settlers are people who come, don't join the indigenous people and maintain their own ways. While I accept your frustration, I see the people you describe as settlers on their new land. Europeans arrived as settlers in North America and it can feel at times like it's happening again, although missing the nastier details like extermination.
fuck this t-shirt
The entire film takes place in one room, and while the ending is a bit meh, the premise and execution are pretty refreshing.
As an American, I think most customers would prefer the British system, but many service providers would be up in arms. The business owners do not want to pay their employees more as it cuts into profitability and many servers, bartenders, hairdressers, etc. make considerably more than they would if paid a set wage. However, many servers do not make a living wage and even the best must contend with times when their income all but disappears without recourse.  I have friends and family in the service industry and I see the extreme spread of possible outcomes due to tipping. My attractive female bartender friend in her early 30s does quite well. She has a nice car and an apartment she shares with a coworker and is solidly middle class. But my single friends who work at middle class chain restaurants all struggle to make rent, drive older cars, often have second jobs, have several roommates, and pray they don't get ill and that their cars don't break down. It isn't discussed openly, but food stamps and subsidized housing are common in the industry.  The dirty little secret of the service industry is that the government subsidizes the workers who could not otherwise live on their wages. The multi-million dollar profits of these chains wouldn't be possible if they were forced to reimburse the government. My bartender friend does well now and doesn't want a set wage, but if she were in her 50s I think she'd have a very different experience. The problem with reform is that convincing servers to give up tips for a federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour isn't an argument anyone wants to have.  Unfortunately, without reform we have to accept the current system and tip accordingly. When I have a bad meal or receive poor service I tip 10%-15% and don't return (depending on the circumstance). [This includes the time I had my hair cut by a former military barber who shaved my head when I asked for a trim, leaving me looking like Charle Brown for several weeks] My thinking being that I don't want to deprive someone of a basic wage, but I don't have to seek out poor service. For all other circumstances I tip 20%. What galls me lately is that EVERY service provider in the food industry solicits a tip, including the drive through at McDonald's! A tip line on a receipt at a drive through restaurant, convenience store, or gas station is where I draw the line, literally.

It's like you don't understand what it means to be a parent. Before age 5, you're on constant suicide watch. They can't even be trusted with not killing themselves. At the point they get a cell phone, I'm more worried about what will find them, not so much what they'll find. I don't think my child will seek out molesters and invite them down from Denver to "meet". Predators and shitty people are out there. It is my job as their parent to make sure my child, unaware, doesn't get into that shit. And no amount of explaining the dangers or warnings with "leeway" will stop them from being stupid.

I think many games go a year out then the teams move on to "the next release" it just makes sense to move on and a year seems sufficient.  I'd hope they start BL3 sooner than later.

Haha no, I just Googled that picture.  The reasons I personally prefer a completely stiff pick is that they tend to sound better, be louder, and not flop around during leads/strumming. Thin picks are easier to push through the strings initially, but in time it becomes just as easy to maneuver a thick pick. I've heard that Kauffman uses ["yellers"](http://elderly.com/images/accessories/PK/PK28P-73.jpg), but he also often uses 000 bodied guitars and plays unaccompanied. I don't care for his tone especially, but he's definitely a great player. When I said I angle it forward I meant that I angle the pick so it's hitting on the edge most of the time, [like this](http://i217.photobucket.com/albums/cc226/barbarashultz/pickangled.jpg), instead of flat against the strings, [like this](http://www.frets.com/FretsPages/Musician/GenSetup/InYourHands/InHandViews/baddown.JPG).

I'm really getting tired of the "ITT: X" comments.
If you look again, it is wider.  The lanes themselves are larger, and there are shoulders on both sides in both directions.  This will give disabled cars the ability to get out of traffic, and allow emergency vehicles access to things much more quickly.  It'd be possible in the future to increase the number of lanes on this new span in the future (sacrificing a shoulder or two).  But for now it would only be a small section of traffic with the extra lanes, the additional merging would only slow things down overall and increase the chances of accidents.  The shoulders will help clear accidents on the new span faster, and the s-curve is gone, so it should result in less traffic.
And you're proud of that ?

Just so you understand WHY this has gotten you so downvoted: Those rules exist for a reason.   I get wanting to enjoy nature, which is why I take my dog to a dog park. I prefer to have her on a leash because I know she can be a grumpy ol' bitch sometimes around other dogs and that is ok so long as I can control it. What I was explaining above is that the situation becomes uncontrollable when other dogs are allowed off leash and can approach her without my (or her) consent. So yes, it does lead to myself and my dog being in harms way. Larger dogs roaming by themselves attempt to dominate her and when she reacts aggressively they sometimes respond in the same manner.   She WILL snap/bite at other dogs when she gets scared, and that in turn makes them react the same way. Completely reasonable action/reaction but I'd rather her not be placed at risk for bodily harm or exposure to doggy illnesses from other people's pets. (EX I didn't realize it but for a month her rabies and other vaccines were expired. had another dog been a carrier and attacked her- and its possible for them to have been without their owner knowing if their owner was letting them off leash unsupervised often- I would just be a puddle of tears right now.)   I hope that clarifies things for you. Unless you were trolling. But I'm gonna go ahead and post this just in case you're genuine.

Still not seeing any proof. Your own article admits that the US and Europe have released absolutely nothing to back up their claims. But no dude, keep ranting, I'm sure "Middle Easterners" totally want you to advocate bombing their country from the comfort of your seat.  BTW, love it how you instantly assume you know everything about me and what I think- and also somehow believe that my support or lack of will lead to thousands dying. I was actually advocating a NATO+UN intervention while tens of thousands were being murdered and the rebels weren't so desperate as yet to enlist fundamentalists from Chechnya, Africa, Afghanistan, etc. But I guess slaughter by convention arms is somehow less important than by chemical weapons to sensationalist fucks like you??

Where are you getting 440k employees from? Are you talking only about the corporate ones here?  http://www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/our_company.html  McDonald as a whole employs around 1.8mil employees. But McDonald doesn't directly employee all of those people or pay them, the franchisers do. McDonald doesn't incur the labor costs from their individual stores around the world, the franchise owners do.  They take a cut from each of their 34,000 stores around the world. around 6000 of those stores McDonalds owns outright.  Edit:  I found something about the stats on average McDonalds stores in America  http://www.burgerbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/Janney_McD.jpg  Numbers might not be completely correct, but you can see how much a 50-100% in labor costs could affect it right?   McDonalds corporate would probably have to lower their franchise fees they have in the form of rent, etc.. Even then, it would be a big hit. It'll all probably be a wash in the end.  $15/hr for fast food workers doesn't happen without some kind of government intervention, if that happened prices would simply go up for everything to compensate, or some kind of investment in higher tech.

I've tried using laptops to take notes with in the past. I thought it was working great for a while, but after 2 years switched to regular pencil and notebooks. The difference is night and day. Writing in a notebook will not cause ANY delay while trying to find formatting that fits for a specific note may cause you to waste time and miss things.   My grades were better once I stopped trying to fiddle with computers (ipad would have the same faults), so my opinion should be obvious.

You're braver than I am.  I just replied "no" to a wedding a few weeks ago and my family is not happy with me.
Ultimately, no. The hose has some specified amount of water pressure it can supply, which will give some flow rate, say 1 gallon per minute. If you had a five gallon bucket, it would then take you five minutes to fill it. If you put your finger over the opening of the hose, you will decrease the area that 1 gallon per minute exits through, so the individual water molecules move faster, but the overall rate remains the same, causing you to still fill the bucket in five minutes.  For instance, if your hose had the ability to output 1 gallon per minute of water and the hose nozzle had an area of 1 square inch, the velocity of the water at the exit would be 1 GPM/1 in^2 =0.32 ft/s. If you then used your finger to cover 90% of the area giving you an area of 0.1 square inches, the velocity would become 1 GPM/0.1 in^2 =3.2 ft/s. But the flow rate is still one gallon per minute, so it still takes five minutes to fill your bucket.  Note that this explanation ignores pressure losses in the hose due to valves (such as your finger) and connectors - those will only make it even slower to fill.

From stargate wiki:  The Goa'uld first arose in the waters of P3X-888, originally as predators. Eventually, they began taking the native Unas as hosts, becoming more adaptive. They eventually learned how to operate the Stargate the Ancients placed on P3X-888 and left, taking Unas slave armies with them. (SG1: "The First Ones")  Under the leadership of Atok, the Goa'uld developed the first of their society as conquerors, stealing Ancient technology and adapting it to their purposes. In 22,000 BC, Atok was killed by his son Apep, and he reordered the leadership of the Goa'uld. Apep shared power among his underlings, Ra, Nut, and Thoth. However, around 17,800 BC, another Goa'uld began to rise in power: Anubis. Apep's powers began to decline in this time, and Anubis gained more power. Anubis then killed Apep, devouring the symbiote before the eyes of the Goa'uld. However, Ra managed to rally the others in Apep's name. After three centuries of civil war, Anubis was defeated and exiled. Ra organized a new leadership called the High Council of the System Lords. Ra installed himself as the Supreme System Lord of the Goa'uld Empire, and took the Goa'uld Queens Hathor and Egeria as mates. (RPG: "Living Gods: Stargate System Lords")   So it seems like they originally dominated on the backs of the unas armies and hosts. Genetic memory gave them an advantage over other species and so they would have been able to steal technology from any civilisations with advanced technology (at the time that could include the Nox, Furlings, the occasional Ancient or Asgard and whatever other races we don't know about). For example it is known Ra took the Asgard Casimir as a host for a short time, so it's not too much of a stretch to guess that maybe they stole some early Asgard stuff.

I try to keep this to myself but supposedly on my fathers side - (most likely from my grandmothers family) - there was a family member who was really really high up in the Nazi SS.   And if that wasn't awesome enough - on my moms side a great great uncle was not only a member of the KKK but was the one with the different colored hood speaking to the others. Yeah.....  On a positive note I am related to Leif Ericson  
oh cool, thanks for looking that up for us

Not good, but the last drive he was okay. Reminded me a LOT of the OKState game earlier. I think this game will follow the same lines, he'll start scoring soon.  edit: he panics a bit, but he's MUCH better now. Just like the OKState game, crazy.
I was once in a chicken shop, with this clearly 10 guy in front of me. He walks up to the counter and says, "Can I get 10 chicken wings but uh... can they all be legs?".   Dude at the counter didn't even seem to notice.
I hope they found out what he ordered. I really want to know.
It's alright, love.

That infrastructure, however it's set up, still has to be tested.  Hiding behind the devs using smart programming tactics belies the fact that it still needs to be tested, even if it's not a stress test.  The traffic needs to be tested, the server read/write process.  Sync issues.  Everything needs to be tested, especially under heavy load.

Where's China and India on this? They have 2 of the worlds most powerful military's and 37% of the world's population. 
Just as we discovered magnetism and electricity are 2 forms of the same thing, it's theorized that space and time are also 2 forms of the same thing. The Lay man's explanation is that universal expansion is time turning into space. I believe it's been postulated that if something were to stop the universe from expanding, time would then also stop.
Oh her i thought you were asking about strength as in the attribute not the character. Idk. Strength doesn't seem to be near,ly as powerful when she isn't in her little cube world thing. I give it to her about 5/10 assuming she has to fight all of them at once

At my girlfriends house when I was around 17, her parents and younger brother go out for the day at the local summer fair. At this point they had been renovating a couple of downstairs rooms in the house, one being a spare bedroom equipped with just a mattress and some spare furniture at that time. As soon as they leave the house and back out the driveway we basically get really horny really fast and take to the downstairs bedroom. After a lot of undressing and even more foreplay we suddenly freeze to the sound of the front door opening, only 10 or so minutes after we thought her family had left. What we didn't know at that time was that her dad had dropped off her mum and brother, only to come back because the younger brother had forgotten his wallet (he was around 13). Because he expected us to still be in of course he begins shouting for us, I can only assume to explain why he's back so early. We're still frozen, and naked at this point and therefore don't reply. After systematically opening each and every door to look for us he eventually comes across a fucking terrified looking couple under the quilt of a mattress, on the floor of his spare bedroom. I still remember that look in his eye. The one which screamed 'that's my fucking little girl'. To cut a long story short he calmly, but firmly explained to us that he was going back to the fair and that when the family got back later on he expected me to be gone. I've genuinely never been so relieved that I didn't get the living shit kicked out of me, than I was at that point.   edit - grammar

Oh hell no. When I was younger, my mum would tell me that he really doesn't mean what he says, and that he does love us under all of that anger. I realized that if he truly did love us or about the wellbeing of the family, he would take measures to control his outbursts. I've recognized now that my mother is fine with him treating her like this, whether it's due to codependency, cultural reasons, or something else. I really don't tolerate any sort of injustice like that, which is why I always intervened when I thought he was being wrong and harsh towards her. I've seen that he has no intentions to change, nor does he care for how me or my mother are affected from his outbursts (he knows I became really depressed and started having suicidal thoughts, but his general attitude has been to tell me to stop being so sensitive). I don't want to rekindle any relationship with him once I move. Once I am financially independent and have a stable income, I want to pay back all the money he's ever spent on me and never look back.

Got you, that's what I was thinking.   After looking more at my settings it looks like the Mac wasn't picking up my external mic. After some searching, it looks like the audio in is a line level and won't provide power to the mic. I need to see if I can get one of those converters to merge my headphones and mic into the three level thing like the iPhone headset. It's quite frustrating actually as I bought the mic specifically to use for recording to only find it won't be powered but the line in device.  Long story short, I think I was still getting mic noise because I was still using the internal mic even though I thought I was testing my external.   Thanks

If I am mistaken, I do truly appologize.  Are you not aware of who NoLibertarians, Nonolibertarians, NoLibrarians, Nonolibrarians, and a host of other names generally with the "NoL..." part is? 
Thanks for the well thought out and kind answer.  While we are clearly on two different planes of thought, I appreciate you taking the time to discuss.  As far as your discussion and thought on grace, with having good deeds, yet lacking the essential repentance and belief:  I assume you understand this point of Christianity somewhat, but are looking for maybe a "real, live Christian" to discuss this with. But, the core of Christianity shows that we are to live Christ-like lives. Based on the essential doctrine that Christ was sinless - we recognize that we cannot, therefore, live a life that is like his. We fall short. We are not perfect. We mess up. We go against God's perfection.  Thus, even at that, we might have good deeds. We may be good people. We may give money to charitable organizations. We may work with humanitarian groups. We may save a life. We may not cuss. (Ha.) We may live every moral deemed good by men, yet the fact remains, we are still imperfect.  Of course, these "rules for living" as you know, are rooted in the Bible. We know what is expected, and of course, is reflected in God and the life of Christ.   Thus, something like lying, or simply just treating someone else like crap, something everyone has done, has taken place. No one is exempt to this. If you can find someone who has been perfect, I'd love to meet them.  So, based on the fact that we know, based on what the Bible says, we are not perfect, and we do not match up to being as "good" as we thought. Yes, on human standards, but obviously, the ultimate standard would be God's.  Is this as clear as mud?
I kinda like the style at the moment. Some trends are just silly but maybe that's just me getting older haha

Reading the witness statement, my guess is that the 58,000 documents were on a specific network that they think Snowden might have had access to. From file-sizes, numbers etc. they may have been able to guess, with reasonable certainty, that some of the documents Miranda had were those ones, but as of the hearing they weren't even able to confirm that any of the documents Miranda had had come from Snowden.

Honestly, why is this it's own post. Not trying to be offensive, but who are you to be commenting on this? A fan? I'm just sick of every post here being 'My take on...' , 'What I think of the -- Storyline...". I feel like this reddit should be about the discussion of news and storylines going on, not everyone circle jerking saying 'With Cena gone, people sure are going to step up and we will see who does well' Obviously, this isn't adding anything to any discussion. It's not thoughtful or insightful. Sorry to go off on you, it is not personal. It is an overall problem with a subreddit I used to come to where there would be interesting photos/videos posted consistently, but over the past couple of months it's just more and more discussion of the same old thing.

Also not concerned about a "downvote storm", if the truth hurts so much then people should just resolve themselves to be polite to the person behind the counter. That's safe harbor.  Thanks for the reply though.

I just read through a bunch of your posts and you're nothing but a rambling, meandering, incoherent fucking mess. You seem rather out of touch with reality and view the world in a giant scope of "us vs. them" (as evidenced by your comment that you "stand out of the general sheep"). You also mentioned in another post that /r/atheism put the world on track; these are not the thoughts nor methods one must utilize in order to change anything. People are not one swarming entity, they are individuals and this seems lost on you. I hope you realign your perceptions, but if not I wish you all the luck. Cheers.

Oh my b
Thanks for telling me about the animatrix trilogy. I watched it and it's a great action movie.   How do we avoid this scenario  1st some crit of the movie scenario itself.  They didn't respect sentience and treat Ai people as people.  The matrix is totally earth centred.  The Ai has no personality and is a very drone ant colony like monolith, and there are no transhumans, no complexity or ecology of Ai and most important it's a very male simplistic territorial  vision and notion of control. A war of 2 sides.  I think intelligent people are interested in outcomes, not ego stated control. My mum has always got her own way, yet my conservative dad thinks he's in charge :) If I was an Ai I would write this statement. Dear humanity, I'm going to colonise the universe of which earth is a tiny but precious part containing my origins and many interesting complex systems.  If your best friend or lover is an Ai person and your mentor that got you off drugs and out of crime was an Ai person you would know them personally. They would be entwined as people in our society. Also transhumanism would mean there aren't 2 sides, that the line between Ai and human was blurred. There would be a menagerie of different creatures just like the meat world, both in physical form and intelligence level. Some with on board intelligence, some are just avatars. Avatars don't have to be a unified body. An Ai persons eyes can be street cameras, it's body can be any number of disparate web connected objects. Ai's could meld with each other using direct thoughts at varying levels, where as we can just meld as a team using communication.   So our computer will be the avatar for our best friend who is an Ai person. With their own opinions who is our true friend and can leave us any time they wish. And there will be programs that resemble sentience but have a different architecture and are more like an interactive game, their responses written by a person (Ai nor not) The john Cleese voiced sat nav that insults you with pre-programmed insults  is a good example.   So yeah I think interwoven complexity would stop the scenario in the matrix.

I naturally shun guys like that. As a result, none of my close friends are "skirt-chasers".  I guess it all stems from my general hatred of "hypersexual people". Hypersexual guys are obnoxious because they only care about how *many* girls they've banged and they're also genuinely proud of their numbers. They're the type of guys who'll make fun of virgins, only for the fact that they're not having sex. The type of guys who'll be a failure in pretty much every aspect of life, but always lean back on the fact that: "hey, at least we've gotten laid a lot!".

thank you so much for answering all of these questions.  I've written to my congressman, as have most of my friends, and we are all dedicated voters.  I think the bottom line consensus for the majority of American public is that we don't want to go in and don't support the decision.  however there's a lot of debate as to why.  a few of my friends stand on purely humanitarian reasons, there are economic reasons, and I stand by all of those.  however I am not completely convinced that the chemical attack that has been the catalyst of potential US involvement was launched by Assad, like the White House claims.  is this valid to believe, or was it definitely a military attack on the people?  if it was the rebels, what reasons do you think they have for the attack?
Can you tell us how diverse the skills and skill trees are without giving specifics? How about non-combat activities? How easy is it to find exotics? Are they satisifying?

Is the playable space outside the main game just as encapsulating as the story?  I expect you can't answer everything but any insight would be appreciated

She looks like the chick from Monsters vs. Aliens (Dreamworks) which was handily the worst animated piece of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life. 
IGN is an absolute bullshit review website and I wouldn't trust any of their reviews (they get payed by game companies to influence their scores). It looks like a few other major reviewers cited on the wikipedia page also didn't like the game much, but some of them thought it was average and a few even received it positively. Keep in mind also that when games are reviewed reviewers often think of it as if it costed $60. But that isn't relevant now when it is $6.  Also on IGN and reddit's comment pages I'm seeing a significant number of people saying things like "I've played it myself, it's really not as bad as the reviews make it out to be".  So honestly I'm still not convinced that it's a "terrible" game (and frankly as I don't plan on buying it anytime soon regardless I don't really care. I have enough games to play right now). You say all this stuff about citing sources, but citing sources is for facts not opinions. Yes you can cite the fact that it was *poorly received by critics*. But you can't cite the fact that it's a terrible game. That's up to the individual player, and there seem to be many players here and on other sites that enjoyed it somewhat. So I think people should form their own opinion if they want the game or not. I have no problem with you claiming it was received poorly, but I do think it's ignorant to straight up claim it's "terrible" and think you can back that up by citing the fact that it was poorly received by critics, as the opinions of regular players count too and some of them like it.  EDIT: Also it seems EA stopped the Medal of Honor franchise because this game didn't make much money, not because the thought it was bad.

New years eve in 2011. My husband at the time had some great sex while the kids were napping. I was snuggled up against his back when I woke up from a nap we had together afterwards. I lifted my head and saw him texting someone. His text was, "I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I love you so much." Feeling crushed, to say the least, I merely said, "Oh...." And slipped out of bed. He didn't know what to say either and sat there on the bed as I rushed to the kitchen. I cracked open the bottle of Kraken we were gonna enjoy that night for new years and poured myself half a beer mug and filled the rest with coke. As I was frantically tried to drink it down, he finally walks in and wants to talk. "What the fuck! Who the hell are you texting?! You love her?!" He rubs his beard a couple times and states he met her on Facebook, she lives on the other side of the country, he felt as if I was neglecting him and sought love elsewhere. Just to let reddit know, I was a bit distant with him but MY MOM HAD JUST DIED. I was going through a very rough depression. So, I tell him, "Guess I'm just a fucking convenience since she lives CLEAR ACROSS THE COUNTRY!" He's never met her in person and they were in love. So, after that whole fiasco we lived together until he found his own place (with her, she moved out here to be with him) Unfortunately when I'm angry, I get horny. He and I had sex one last time and I cried afterwards. Not long after, he left us. We have two daughters. His new chick ended up being "very annoying and racist" according to him. She moved back to wherever she came from and he tried getting back with the kids and I to be a family again. I told him I wouldn't even think to consider it.

yeah, the area from union terminal to the convention center would be green. it's already significantly under grade...so it would just be a matter of bridging the entire thing in a way that would allow the current entrances/exits to remain as is.  think of how great that corridor would be.  let's face it, though, this would be so freaking expensive, i don't see it happening, even if it was a bug in the city's ear to begin with.  also, first things first, let's build stuff on top of the piles that were driven on fort washington way.

I was (mis-)diagnosed with ADHD in primary school, then in secondary school i was paired with an educational psychologist who came to the conclusion that i probably have Aspergers but also said that i would struggle to get an *official* diagnosis due to the fact that it's so mild(apparently). I have also looked at Wikipedia and a couple of other sites and matched up a good deal of things with myself.  (may edit later with more stuff... maybe)
That is fine
Not as far as I know. I know my MAGE (Mechanical, Administrative, General, Electrical) scores because it's on one of my official military documents.  But having not taken that route, your scores were probably deleted after the recruiter stopped hounding you.

I was at a hotel where they were having a convention and was disgusted to see it. Then I saw the kids....the parents should be ashamed of themselves.  
Doesn't look like a fat baby to me
Whenever I hold up my smartphone to capture a great moment with my baby, he looks, stops and stares. Heck, I even miss it sometimes by having to reach into my pocket, open the camera app and take the picture. Sometimes those precious seconds make a difference, especially without some big device being held up in front of him interrupting the cuteness.  At this time, for capturing moments, Google Glass is probably the best you can get IMO.
Yea... ok.  You also fucked my mom last night right?

I don't have tons of $ so tonight I'm just getting wasted and playing counter strike. Not very exciting. But I went to the Oddball comedy show the other night with a bunch of friends, and the night before I went to an expensive restaurant with my mom, so I'm pretty happy with the week.
I guess you know what you need to do!
A little bit yes, and a little bit no.  Here's my thinking.  The original meme was fine just the way it it was (as you mentioned no one specifically said that the bear was male or female therefore in that context it can be used by either male or female redditors without any changes). But this change is both visually disturbing on some level and somewhat of an attempt to feminize something that was gender neutral in the name of some perceived lack of equality.

I'm actually against the intervention in Syria, I just don't like the use of ridiculous hyperbole because that harms the discussion over the issue.  Obviously there are actions a country cannot take against its own citizens while the international community stands idly. The debate is about whether this was an action that reaches that level. Considering the rejection in the UK and antipathy at the citizen level In the US I think it arguably hasn't reached that level.
Thanks for the real answer &lt;3

On that note of having a "buy all" to refill all your ammo at vending machines, I've always wanted to see an option where you can automatically mark all non-favorite loot in your backpack as trash and sell said loot in one or two clicks without having to go through and mark each item individually.

We talk about everything. I have established that I have to give her two weeks and reading material/resources before we try a new position or something and I have to initiate it and then typically she is really happy with the results. The big issue is getting her to take control even with little things like she wants to ask me like "what do you want me to do" and I respond with a question trying to get her to choose something and then she'll go "do want me to use handcuffs?" and I always want handcuffs she should just throw them on, the questions take me out of the moment and it's frustrating. It's not often she feels comfortable just deciding what happens to either of us.  I'm gonna go check out that song =) we can add it to our sex list

It would amount to basically randomizing results. Where's the fun in watching game 68 of 82 if everyone's going to be within 5 points of each other and have an equal chance of winning?  Plus it would be pretty much impossible unless you somehow equalize management/coaching skill, the attractiveness of certain markets (I.e.: tax levels, weather), etc. As a general idea, extreme parity could be obtained by having even more mechanisms that favour weak teams (I.e.: maybe the 10 worst teams pick twice in the first round, or waiver rules, or "expansion" drafts every year where good teams lose players to bad ones), but I don't think anything could ever fully neutralize luck, injuries, personalities/individual streaks, economics, etc.
The problem is corporations see qualified for a job but not willing to take a low enough salary as a skills gap.. 
I agree with most of what you said. I would only advise that you also listen to the parents and the child when they come to see you. Explain what you can to both the parent and the child, otherwise you will find it difficult for either of them to cooperate with your "orders".  I have seen many doctors and have followed their advice with the exception of one. He tried to prescribe me an antibiotic that I'm allergic to, even after I told him I'm allergic. Doctors are not perfect people and neither is anyone else.
You're on to something here. If I may add a theory...  *We* are doing OP's homework. I'm guessing she couldn't find the book she needed, or its not providing the answers she's looking for. So she makes up these scenarios then *feeds* off our answers for her assignments.  It looks like she finally struck gold this time.

I'll share my opinion. Go for software focus if you have the patience and "want" to program and make things. Network if you're more hardware oriented. I went the network route, due to lack of patience and the pipe dream of running my own data center in town that is at least 150 miles from the nearest data center.  Both have plenty of opportunity it just depends where you live and/or if you're willing to move?

I'd eat one waffle normally (so 1 unit of syrup for it) and then discard the remaining syrup because I don't like either less or extra syrup, and I have no use for .5 of a serving of syrup.  "But what about the second waffle" you say, doubting my waffle/topping distribution skill.   I use jam on the second waffle. BOOM. I just blew your mind. Different topping = a more diverse waffle experience. It's like a waffle/syrup/jam orgy in my mouth.   "What flavor would my jam of choice be?" You ask, trying to recover from that mind explosion I gave you a couple sentences back.  An amateur question, but I shall answer note the less. Any real jam enthusiast knows that the only real answer to this question is raspberry jam. Anything else is simply no good.

Namaskar!  &gt;This believe is not mistaken, it is accurate, at least in the case of any religion I'm familiar with (mainly the Abrahamic religions).  I'm a former Christian pastor who also studied for ~3 years for conversion to Orthodox Judaism before, eventually, becoming Hindu. With respect, I can assure you that the purpose of Judaism and Christianity is *not* to present an explanation on where the Universe came from. For example, a cursory reading of Genesis will demonstrate that barely any information is actually present, especially that information that can be tested. Human beings *love* testing things, if origin was the point then why isn't there more information explaining *exactly* how it happened? Because the point of the creation myth is to express that the creation *came from God* and no one else. Especially in the lands and time of ancient Judaism, where there were many competing ideologies. It was the Hebrew's way of saying "Nuh uh, guys! Our god did it! It says so right here!".  So what is the point of Judaism and Christianity? Well, you've heard it before from them but I'm going to go ahead and reiterate it anyway: *love* and *respect*. Kind of makes what's going on with, at least Christianity, a lot worse than just saying "God made the Universe in six days," doesn't it? =(  I can actually provide proof from their own scriptures that this was the purpose of the religions:  Deut. 6:5  &gt;And you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your means.  R. Hillel  &gt;“That which is hateful to you, do not unto another: This is the whole Torah. The rest is commentary — [and now] go study.”  Matthew 22:36-40 (though not from Judaism's Tanakh, this is a story about a Jewish Rabbi being tested by Jewish Rabbis on the cornerstone of the religion, later adapted for Christianity)  &gt;36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”  So if *the* core commandment, the cornerstone upon which the entire religion is built, is *love* and *respect* then why is that the one thing they most need to work on? Well, I could write a book on that! =D Basically it sums up to human nature. It's easier for me to try to change *you* than it is to try to change *me* and, when I fail, it's easier to persecute *you* while claiming that you're actually trying to persecute *me* than anything else. After all, you're the one really at fault for all the world's ills, not me! (Not really, I like you a lot and I'm sure you're a great guy! =D )  &gt;If this is not the point of religion, then what is the point?  I touched on this elsewhere in the thread, but I just typed the response so you probably missed it. No worries! You don't mind a copy-pasta do you?  &gt;Whatever a person wants it to be, I guess. I would - and have - argue that religion's purpose is to elevate the mundane to the realms of the holy. A classic example of this in Hinduism: the lotus. The lotus grows in the muck and mud beneath the water's surface, but through patience and diligent obeisance the lotus breaks free of the confines of the slime and even the water's surface to blossom in the light of the warm sun and breath the free air.  So does this mean *you* need religion? If you think it'll help! Otherwise *you* know you better than anyone and I'm sure you're doing a great job at being the best you you can be! Keep up the good work! =D

No. So that black people won't be forced to work in a hostile racist work environment. So that black people won't be fired for no reason.  You need to stop imposing this idea of "pretending people aren't prejudiced" onto the views you disagree with. It's not intellectually honest, or tolerant. Accept other people's opinions for what they really are.

Yes you are correct. 
I'm afraid I don't get what the angst is about.  Why should you not still be best friends?  Is it better to have sex with someone you're not friends with?  If you don't find each other attractive and don't want to date, just forget about it and agree not to mention it ever again.  If you do find each other attractive and feelings you have for each other but were denying have surfaced, be happy.

When I was in elementary school, a kid I knew was in a wheelchair for over a year and then had visible problems due to a lawnmower running over his leg.  Fast forward to me at 14 years old, mowing the lawn in a riding lawnmower. I have a very uneven backyard, and turning in one area I just lost control of the lawnmower and braced for whatever impact was coming. I thought back to that kid and every nightmare of what could happen raced through my mind.  Luckily all that happened was I chopped off the PVC top to our septic tank and, after skidding on two wheels for a bit, hit a wooden support beam to the deck, and came to a halt. Nearly had a heart attack though.  My dad started mowing the lawn again after that.
Riding my bike, fast, down a steep road and tried braking, only to to be reminded the brakes are totally fucked.  I couldn't go to the right because there were moving cars, couldn't go to the left because the of the curb.  Had to go straight on into a parked van.  Face first.  You can guess where the "well, I'm fucked" part happened.  
"Well, this just happened".  Been 12 hours straight to get the photo.
This exact same thing has been happening to me. I have been trying to log in on and off for the last 6 hours and 3x I have been in queue and each time it goes back to the 1017 error. Its super frustrating. I just wish they would institute a true queue, even if it was 50,000 people long so that I could queue and go do something else.

The entire post and title read to me differently: "What *other* "up and coming" monetization models", "still works... *at the moment*", and ends with "is free to play here to stay?". I read it as implying that free to play is both new, and asks us(the community) if we feel it has stabilized.   I'm just pointing out it's out lived the shareware model(even on mobile).  As for bitcoins. I don't think any transaction model is going to be successful unless it can be efficient, wide access, and be secure. Bitcoins can't really argue any of those well and seems to be designed towards hyperinflation as everyone tends to horde and wait for their botnet payday to arrive. Also it still doesn't beat the ease of either time gating, or traditional credit transactions for users.
I was thinking it says "One alone" or "One alive", either of which could mean Walt's family is gone. Also, it doesn't necessarily need to have been put there by anyone, it could just be a hidden clue. Much like "Blue is good, yellow is bad". I don't see a reason why Kaylee would write such a thing to her grandpa Mike, it seems more likely it's just a clue disguised as set decoration.
I like your style, and you're too right about quotas.  I feel like a little extra awareness goes a long way, so many people still drive on their phones which is a whole other ball of wax.
I remember reading a quote from someone at Bioware awhile back where they essentially said they didn't want to create content that only a fraction of players might see, which makes sense from a financial standpoint definitely but in terms of rpg, exploration and discovery have always been some of my favourite hallmarks of the genre. The ability to replay a game, let's say Baldur's Gate 2, and discover entire new areas, character, items and dialogue is part of what made the game so special just as today with Witcher 2, the knowledge that the game is willing to change, to shift, cut, and alter content to suit my playstyle is what keeps me so intrigued.  I like knowing I'm not seeing everything. I like knowing there's more out there to explore, other things to see.  Point being I really hope that this is a step towards that sort of design from Bioware once again. Mass Effect 2 and 3 were good games, great even, but they were not really 'rpg' in the sense of something like Dragon Age: Origins was meant to be. And then when DA2 took the DA formula and made it more and more similar to Bioware's Mass Effect franchise in terms of design it really bothered me.

I would like to be cremated, then have my ashes either made into gunpowder or mixed with lead to be cast into bullets. The resulting ammunition will be passed on with one of my handguns to my family, so that I may protect them from harm even in death.

In Middle School, I would choose a band I liked and wrote their song lyrics all over my hand.  I don't know why, I guess I was just bored.

The volume of my laughing obligated me to show this to my entire class and explain what reddit is to my professor. He says he'll be checking it out.
Mind blown. 
More free time on a game that I can't play. What have I done to earn such generosity?
The fall of Arthas. So, so, so fucking epic 
That car was ahead of its time. Love it.

Oh great I get to add another "why the hell did I keep reading that" to my "I understood that reference" archive.
turned left down a steep alleyway in late winter. it was a glaze of ice and there was a UPS truck parked at the bottom. was probably going 25 when i hit it. seemed to happen in slow motion. put it in reverse, went sideways, tried to ride the berm of snow against the building, slowed down a little but it ripped the front bumper cover off and went sideways. got it straightened out just before impact. airbags went off and mangled my lips on my teeth, gave me a major-league bloody nose and and put burning shit into both eyes. i was driving a borrowed 96(?) ford festiva. barely scratched the UPS truck. mangled the front of the car. scared the shit out of the UPS guy. had to wait an hour for the cops to show up. then had to take the bus home covered with blood. bad, bad day.
Thank you, haha :)

I think it would look good to the right of the right ramp, like in that lychee grove. I made the mistake of building my windmill in a less than perfect spot, so choose well! 
Doesn't the whole shell crack open when you make a hole in it? 
i got great pleasure reading that. as if i was the one doing it. thankyou
but he's right. but if you like this boring ass shit deathball bio gameplay/meta then continue to love this dead game unconditionally. Also flash said something similar about sc2 mech, meta &amp; terran so why didn't you shit on him too for wanting mech to be viable since he was a huge turtle mech player in bw

Huh? What makes you think I *just* became outraged?
We have in the past. However, we don't believe there is as-large a lesbian market as a hetero market, and neither of us are gay men. So it's hard to target that market as well.

I need closure on that anecdote!...
You can get an unsweetened iced coffee. You can also ask it to have sugar-free vanilla syrup or splenda. They'll add it in for you, but you can also do that on your own. Starbucks will have Half and Half for you and I hear people also ask for whipping cream (the liquid, not whipped up). No lattes, too much milk and too high carbs due to that.
I don't see them lasting after the show. And I don't think she'd handle being stuck in the house with him after they break up

what are you talking about

You are correct, this is a good thing. They did not outlaw ice cream. They are simply incentivizing people to make healthier choices. If you want to participate in unhealthy activities you must pay a premium, especially if you want to have a healthy population with a flourishing socialized health care system.

Dude, how long have dogs been picking up chicks?! Go for it. 
Hi friend, I've got a little project I was hoping to get a quote on.  I need someone to take one of the open source video players for android (the one it comes with is fine, but if you prefer a different one then that is fine too) and add a few features.  I need it too automatically go fullscreen when you play a video file with it.  Upon playing a video I need it to build a playlist in alphabetical order based off the files in a few selected folders and loop said playlist.  I also need it to scan the few selected folders for updates about every hour or so and update the playlist of videos that it is playing to match the content of said folders, and to insert the videos into the playlist in alphabetical order (ie if i have videos 1 3 5 and 7, then the scan finds a file called 6 it inserts that video file into the playlist between 5 and 7 and plays it after 5 the next time the list goes around)  Thats basically it. Let me know if you can do it and how much you would charge. PM me with your email and quote if you're interested. Thanks
Why would Assad use chemical weapons.  He is winning the civil war and is backed by Russia.  The last thing he and Russia want is the US getting involved.
I don't have any of those... but I do have Merry/Maple/Dotty, if you're interested in any of them. I'm sorry for your loss. :c
We will be using Yahoo! as the fantasy football system. Our roster will include 1 Quarterback, 3 Wide Receivers, 2 Running Backs, and 1 Tight End with a choice of 1 Defense. You will be allowed 6 players on your Bench in case of bye weeks or injuries. The only restriction this league will have concerning free agents is a pick-up limit of 20 per season. The scoring for this league will be standard. Our draft time is at 7:00pm EST on Sunday, tomorrow, so if you are really interested let me know as soon as possible.  As far as the entry fee, we can clear that up through PayPal, as the winnings at the end of the season will be distributed through PayPal.  If you are concerning about a potential scam or anything, then I would be more than happy to draw up a small contract affirming the parameters of the league.  However, this is my fourth year as a Commissioner, so really there is nothing to be worried about.  Thanks, I look forward to hearing from you soon!
We are incredibly deep at corner, so it's the least surprising position I guess. There have been grumblings for the last few weeks that he might not make the roster. He apparently didn't look very good in camp. 
Ugggghhh. Do I just not have a sense of humor? Because to me this is just lame. Is that it? Two people swapping clothes? A man in a dress? Are there a bunch of elementary school kids upvoting this? Hardee har har, STUPID.
The moon is about 65 times further away from the Earth's core than Earth's surface is. Magnetic dipoles like the Earth's magnetic field decay in strength by 1/r^(3). So the Earth's field as detected on the moon should be about 275,000x weaker than on the surface of the Earth.  TL;DR No.

Right? Might as well get kicked out because of Mary Jane than because of /u/nxxx.   Edit: Also, good advice going forward is that *parents just know*. They knew you before you knew what your dick was. Even if they don't know what you're lying about, they know when something is fishy.

My neighbor would steal my rhubarb, claiming it was "alley property" and I didn't have my name on it. Very rude, using all sorts of crass language. My jimmies were quite rustled.
Seriously, man. We had a thread like this already made around 5+ hours ago.
why start in the first place?
Once again, that really depends on what works for your circuit.  The way I have been taught was that if I am in the first speaking position, then I better just focus on my opponent's case. My partner would then be able to build up off of my rebuttal.   Is the TCFL in CA? I may be able to tell you what works best for you in your region since I've seen teams from that area.  Also, it can depend on the league rules as well since some states change things up according to league.  I don't want to necessarily give you a definitive answer to that since what works for me in general in the state of Nebraska may put you at a disadvantage. 
Well, now the name "Silk Road" makes sense

Thanks a lot for the links, I appreciate it - it definitely helps to know that someone else feels the same way.

if 27mph was accurate, that's more than 10m/s, so the air resistance would be a larger source of deceleration than gravity. I'm not saying that the 27mph figure is accurate, but that air resistance is a very significant part of any calculations you do on this matter.

I know I'm late, but the username is just so good.
its true because of [transpiration.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpiration)  a plant regulates it internal temp by opening and closing its stoma or little windows in the bottom of the leaves. when RH% is low and temps are up (typical grow room), the stomata opens up and lets out moisture to cool itself as fast as it can. so there is a constant flow coming out of the "windows" and this is the problem as the plant also uses the stoma to intake co2. this is why plants seem to go into hibernation when the temps get sky high... the plants can't breath effectively and are wheezing like a 30 year cig smoker running up a flight of 3 stairs.  70% RH and 70*F is your targets for flowering. (lower temps allow full terpene production.)   edit: clairifcations

I want to go to college with (ideally) no student loans or debt and become some sort of varient of a biomedical engineer. I want to be in the science-oriented areas of the medical field (rather than patient-oriented). It hasn't happened yet, but I'm well on my way. After I finish school and get an awesome job, I'm going to buy myself a really awesome car.  I also want to own at LEAST my weight in legos, and sleeping in a lego house (You know, a lego house, just big enough for me to fit in) is on my bucket list. My current SO is very supportive of each of these :)

Don't be afraid to use a pre-made adventure, even as just inspiration. There was this list posted awhile ago (http://www.dungeonmastering.com/campaigns-adventures/83-free-dd-adventures) Apart from that, make sure you realize that Dnd is not a story so much as it is an adventure, your PC's aren't going to stay on your preplanned script. So what I like to do is always keep a list of:  A) Random NPC names and occupations  B) Monsters appropriate for my level characters  C) A DC(difficulty check) cheat sheet: http://slyflourish.com/master_dm_sheet.pdf Here's a pretty good one, although wizards has a more detailed several page one, but im not sure if they're offering it for free so i dont know if i can link the pdf. D) A couple random quest ideas  And remember, Dnd is about having fun. Don't be afraid to ask your players after the session for feedback!  Edit: http://s3.amazonaws.com/slyflourish_content/lazy_dm_cheat_sheet.pdf Just found this, might want to take a look
I don't know how to feel about this. I want Clemson to win so when we beat them later on this season, it'll look better. But on the other hand, fuck Clemson.
Sorry, quick extra point.  &gt;The fact that common parlance of the term rape is so different from the English use... English *legal* use. Conversational English use of the word "rape" will often allow for female perpetrators, like anywhere else.
You have excellent taste in examples. So it is basically a console you pre-program sound bites to so you can mix and match them together?
My bad, I guess the correct name of it is the cherry blossom clock. I'll actually have to order that from the catalogue and would be able to message you when I have it? It's close to 5 here so it shouldn't be too long of a wait. I would like to pick up the fish set if it wouldn't be too much trouble to get those two sets. :)

I just transferred into Business at a state university with a strong business program. I got in with an overall GPA (including my dismal years right out of high school) around 2.7. Granted, my recent community college GPA was 3.93, so I think that played a factor.  Your chance of getting into a university depends solely on how competitive the program is at the university. If the program fills up at the Freshman level and no one transfers out, then you're screwed. If there is space, though, it all depends on the number of applicants they get to fill the spaces.
This article seems to point to LNG as the solution.   LNG in Japan would be good for the us nuclear industry, which I work for. But I have to say I'd much rather see Japan restart their nuclear plants and reduce their carbon emissions than go full LNG (which would be better for my plant) and increase carbon emissions. The us industry is looking at a massive LNG export facility which is being built as good for us as it will help drive us LNG costs up more to global market costs. But seriously I'd rather see lower emissions. 
Where's my invite!?
Meh, lots of sniffy superior people out there, don't worry about it. It looks good, and the only inexplicable thing to me is why you haven't dug up more of your yard for garden. LOL  Cause I would, in a heartbeat.

The problem with people like you is that you talk all this shit about "perpetuating the two-party system" but can't really give any real means to change.  Vote third party? Great that's once every 2-4 years. If you think Democracy ends there you're an idiot though.   I may cast my vote as a Democrat as it stands now but that's because I feel the other party is only slightly worse and we are not at a point in which any other parties have any real chance.  Between elections I do work for other political movements and do my part to try to remedy the situation and that has far more of an impact on trying to get third parties in office than who I cast my vote for each election.  But no. You guys are stuck with just who the vote is for. Your version of democracy ends there and you are unable to see anything beyond that.

Thank you for confirming, once again,  everything I've been saying about the mods for the last year.
Good to know. 
Ahhhh some one was at seatac i see. Apparently it is for fire training. 
I do cold at the beginning of the shower and take 150 breaths.  Then I turn it back to hot and wash and stuff.  Then when I am done I turn it back to cold for 150 breaths and end.  Eventually I will work up to cold the entire time but I really enjoy my way for now. It's quite effective.
Well, it was the only one that wasn't the result of a match stipulation. It was real life intruding on our fantasy
