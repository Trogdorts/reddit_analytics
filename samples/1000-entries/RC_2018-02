Welcome to generation void 
Welcome
I'm 16 and the friend told me he was joking after I reported it 
What?  It’s a niche rpg. Most rpg fans are adults.  Why’d ya have to bring race or weight into it? Yeesh kid. 
solid!
I agree 
Dude its done the same thing for me idk if I'm fucking it up or if its software issue but if you do get it workinf please let me know. Ill do the same 
That's what you call "melting down" and the infamous "reeeee" you've heard about.
I'm sorry that happened to you, I had a similar thing happen to me and it worked out okay. I went to a first aid class with the rest of my uni cohort and fainted after doing CPR (I was doing a fitness challenge at the time and probably hadn't eaten/drunken enough that day, so my own fault really). I was out for maybe 10 seconds at most, and when I came to my classmates were all super concerned. One guy gave me his sandwich, another went to buy me some Powerade and bananas. I went home, then the next time I went to class a couple of friends asked me if I was okay and that was it. Never brought up again, I wasn't the focus of attention at all. It was just a couple of friends checking up on me, as if I'd just had the flu or something.   And I also kinda dealt with it through humour, which is kinda my go-to. For example, I had to do a speech later that year to the same class and I made a joke about how I never could've been a doctor because I couldn't even get through a first aid class without fainting. I still use that all the time when people ask me why I chose my career (biomed engineering). Being able to laugh with people about something frightening or bad can really help you to realise it's no big deal, but I also get it if that wouldn't work for you - it's just an idea!
You do realize that January is practically over, right?   It's already February in China and in much of Europe, are you seriously expecting some sort of massive plummet in the next 8 hours? 
I've also heard her more often with Hayashi but I know she worked with Sawano on Owari no Seraph. And so far I'd say the music in DitF sounds more Sawano-like, minus the vocal/horn style.
Ironic they wrote a song about meeting an angel (Azusa) when they're actually all angels

There are many descriptions of relatively easy births among preagricultural peoples. I just read one in Lewis and Clark journals, Shoshone woman stays behind, delivers her own child, catches up to the crew at the next camp. No problem.
There we go! Any news?
Hey man, which version did you use on tsssaver? (10,3) or (10,6)?
Personal experience: my first job was in a startup.  The Pay was not great but I used that opportunity to grow not only on a technical level but also on a biz level.  This helped me a lot on my second job.  On my second job, if issues arised, I would recommend solutions and lead implementation based on the experience i has from startup. I was able to participate in discussions with biz teams and provide explanation why the solution was good etc. My  confidence was based on my startup experience as well as tech knowledge ( but as a young woman in tech, confidence based on past experience was important to me) On my second job, I was promoted within 6 months to a program manager role and leading major new tech projects.  I think it’s all worth it, startups are like an apprenticeship to me.
This makes me like Guillermo del Toro even more

Fired an entire volley of dragon pods at Teostra with increased slinger capacity, he didn't seem to care. His cloak didn't go away until he super nova'd. This was solo, so he didn't have multiplayer stats either.

I agree, but on the one hand, they've gone on record that Planeswalkers have a narrow design space, hence why we only get a little over 20 in a year. But I do wish they'd play around with more designs like Kaya, Sarkhan the Mad, and Nissa than the regular three-ability or four-if-pushed formats.
 There's a lot of redditors here that live in the area maybe/hopefully someone saw something. 
Is there one that doesn't have any words in it?  I feel I'd earn the most if I never had to talk to any other fucker ever!
This is awesome and I'm super pysched that Chris Barrett is busting his ass.  I'm fully confident that he will restore the game to the fun time we all know and love.  But unfortunately he's been given a mountain to fix and correct, which is going to take patience and time.  I just don't see myself or my friends getting back into this game until the new DLC (since we paid for it), at which point I hope they can sustain us.  Mr. Barrett is tasked with putting lipstick on a pig and hoping that can sustain us through.  All the best to him and I hope he does it, as I'd like to be able to enjoy this game again.  The sandbox update will be the real big change, but I don't think any of us are holding our breaths.  The best thing Bungie could probably do right now is get rid of their entire upper management structure and half their mid management staff.  There just seems to be too many hands in the stew and it's making a mess.  
The outfit of the day today features a pale pink houmongi (semi-formal kimono) with a *kumihimo* motif. Kumihimo are traditional braided cords, ranging from simple solid-colours to complex patterns and motifs. Traditionally, they were used for anything that needed binding, like samurai armour or to tie gifts closed/together. Nowadays, they're mostly used for kimono, such as *obijime* or the cords used to fasten a *haori* closed. Interestingly enough, this person has paired the kimono with a similarly-themed obi.  The tradition of braiding *kumihimo* has made a bit of a comeback thanks to the wildly popular and critically acclaimed anime film, *Your Name* (*Kimi no Na wa*) by Makoto Shinkai.
In other words, it's basically creating a mini tornado.
Nice, any option recommendations to loosen up the targrting and jerking of the camer?

I disagree. All those elements have been around TH for years. There's occasionally someone who causes way more drama, but that passes when they leave eventually. Yuudai isn't even as bad as some of the other people who have been on the show. He's not malicious, he's just dumb, young &amp; selfish.  As for the supermarket "incident", it's possible that nothing appeared to happen to the crew. The crew aren't always around, and aren't always filming 24/7 so there's going to be stuff they miss. I think Yuudai's mood likely turned as they were coming home or when they got home, because he probably felt like Ami was rude, or inconsiderate by agreeing to the date only to change her mind on the day. Yuudai seemed surprised to hear Ami say it was good until he got home, seemed like the impression she gave was that it wasn't a lot of fun at all.
Thank you kind human, I shall continue praying to the swole gods.

Sure, her parents can grant her [power of attorney](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/forms/advdirectives/f00036.pdf) so she has authority to make financial decisions on their behalf. Most financial institutions accept state forms like this one; some places prefer their own. Otherwise, her parents can ask the landlord, collections agency, etc., to add her as an authorized contact. Some places will not comply, but it never hurts to ask.
Programs like NiceHash do all of this decision making for you.

Depending on the game, skill level/MMR, and other things, you can do either. But most of the time you want to skip mana leak until your other skills are maxed.   Illuminate and chakra are all about farming and using your nuke. They help your team fight better.  If you team 100% lacks stuns, mana leak usually doesn't make up for it. If your allies naturally have mana drain, getting 2 points max is good.   If your team has too many farmers, don't skip mana leak. This could be one alchemist, or 3 side lane cores and a farming 4th core.  For example, if you are going for a kill, if you have one stun and think mana leak with right clicks is better than 100 magic DPS per second, then do that. Other situations are if they can dodge illuminate like puck, phantom lancer, etc.

It was a relatively  new feeling for Vivien, feeling *wanted.* Of course, people had hinted at it before, Erryk and Bulwer and Rosby. Their offers were so solid. They wanted to marry her, to tie her down and make certain no one else could touch her. But Charlie, with his whims and changeability that he had so often spoken to her about, was a different story. His words sent a thrill through her, and she wanted to feel more of it, *so much* more of it.   She didn't know how to put it in words at first, what she felt. It was like every part of her gravitated towards him, but being so close still wasn't enough. Vivien kissed him, hand sliding up the back of his neck and into his brown curls, pressing into his body, the sheer silk hardly more than water between their skin. She broke away for a moment, now with certainty about what she wanted.   "I want you to show me what that means. I want to *feel*..." she kissed at the hollow of his throat, at his clavicle, right below his ear, "wanted. I've been the one deciding everything, and you've not done anything more with me, as I thought... as I thought you might. That was very kind. So now I'm inviting you to. I want you to take me," she said.   Her hands clasped around his shoulders as she whispered into his ear, not even needing to hardly reach to make it to that level. Then, she just waited, curious to see what her request would bring. 
Is that a bit before or after noon?
Jokes aside, I genuinely wish him well and hope he gets to show why we paid him so much money.

Yeah, the rigorous standards that our smoke alarms have to conform to would never take that long to go off. Any sort of rented accommodation would have multiple smoke alarms on the ground and upper floors too, so you'd almost certainly be notified there's a fire.  In terms of having time to "stop the fire yourself", that's really not the intention. It's about giving people adequate time to escape, which is again something that houses must be designed or adapted for. The dwelling itself has a role in slowing or stopping the spread of fire by design.
Congrats! It's a nice pose, very satisfying to hold!

&gt;By the way, I trust police officers, perhaps you have reasons not to in the US/UK.  Honestly, I think this is the biggest disconnect here, because no, I do not trust police officers at all. And neither do most people in the US who aren't white, straight, and well off financially or ultra-conservative.  We have LOTS of reasons for this distrust:  https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/12/10/daniel-shaver-philip-brailsford-shooting-bodycam-video-sandoval-pkg-newday-new.cnn  https://www.theroot.com/baltimore-cops-kept-toy-guns-to-plant-just-in-case-they-1822546984?utm_source=theroot_twitter&amp;utm_medium=socialflow&amp;__twitter_impression=true  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTovuNsGiw8&amp;feature=youtu.be  http://thefreethoughtproject.com/72yo-grandma-shot-dead-raid-plant/  http://abcnews.go.com/US/court-oks-barring-high-iqs-cops/story?id=95836  http://thefreethoughtproject.com/plainclothes-officers-chase-murder-unarmed-man/  http://thefreethoughtproject.com/disgruntled-gamer-sent-swat-team-innocent-mans-home/  I could post these for days.

So I can't really say anything because I'm not your partner, but what really pings my "TRANSciever" (as it were) is "I wish I was born a girl".  That's not a thing that most cisgender (non-trans) guys say.  If they wish they were a girl, I would have to think they likely ARE a girl, inside that is. If they are trans, it's fairly easy for them/us to hide those parts of our identities we don't want people knowing.  AGAIN, I'm not them so I can't say anything. That being said, even if they are trans, do not, I repeat DO NOT prematurely out them.  That is something they need to tell you.  If you tell them that you know they're trans, or something else, (especially that you were snooping their browser history), that's going to completely destroy their confidence in you.  So wait for them to come to you.  If you REALLY want to expedite the process, you can try talking about LGBT topics with them, but I wouldn't push anything. If and when they do come out as trans, hopefully we would be able to help you along with any questions you have.  On that, is there any questions you have at this point in time???
I have a pretty good feel for it if im just trusting my gut. I was only have problems when i acrually put thought into it and looked at the map.  If they are 125m and 250m that would make sense
The balance in her account doesn't nees to move in order for the bank to use cash. Her account being frozen simply means the bank doesn't owe her her money. They don't have to return it.  If you owe someone $1000 and that person suddenly goes away for good, you suddenly find yourself $1000 dollars richer because you don't owe him anymore.  Regarding how they pay off the creditor, that I wouldn't know and it is within their agreement on how they handle this
Wow, they are cranking out commits left and right. The team seems really committed. haha...pardon the pun.   Don't worry guys, this happens all the time. Little bugs pop up in production and require hotfixes like this. It's better to delay and do something right when it comes to an unveiling like this.

Well done! I'm glad your mother is being supportive. As for your father of course you don't need to tell him if you're uncomfortable with it, but you should try and get your mum to ease it in because maybe your dad won't like the fact your mum has known and kept it from him. Like keeping a secret.

NotW grabbed me from the first sentence. It has flaws, but I didn't notice a one of them until I was done reading. That holds true for everyone I know personally who has read it. If you don't feel compelled to finish it at 60%, it's time to put in down. There's too much amazing sff out there to waste time reading books you're not enjoying.
I want to skip a lecture with you. 
&gt; My father stepped out when I was a teenager and my mom is a drug addict and... not around. I didn't have what your son had growing up.  To be fair, you probably had more. I'm his foster dad.

If you ever want to talk, about anything, PM me. I'm good at listening.

He is basing it on the fallacy that ANY work for any amount is better than unemployment.  The employer has nothing but self-interest.  That isn't a problem by itself.  Screwballs advising them to take it makes it a problem.  In their self-interest the company threw him a low-ball part time offer without benefits hoping for desperate stupidity.  The manager selling it as a great opportunity is only considering whether it is a great opportunity for the company.  That manager is either evil or ignorant.  Either way, this job sucks before you read the job description.  I doubt they will accept that offer or even counter offer.  They will pay more for someone less effective before they would have the wisdom to seriously consider the value in this offer.  I bet they come back with "the part time low-ball is because we're trying to help more people get back to work.  Why are you so selfish?"

It was honestly fucking amazing, and it was one of my favorite shows when I was younger. Plus, it's one of those golden cartoons that are written well enough for adults to enjoy them.  Here's the [first episode on Youtube](https://youtu.be/9nPrVb496aw), you should check it out if you have the time. I'm actually about to watch some of these since apparently someone uploaded a bunch of episodes. The first episode is long and overall pretty alright, but it gets better later

It sounds like they’re wholesale grafting the Futurama: WoT system onto this game. It’s not bad, aside from the fact that it gates quite a bit of content behind very high required character levels and makes it extremely hard to level up said characters.

I mean, that's not how every person reacts to pressure and hard times. Not everyone is going to have a breakdown in the form of a sobbing and screaming match. Some people just clam up and some people focus on keeping things as routine as possible to keep things as normal as they can. That's actually a good reason why some people seem to enforce order in a hectic situation. Just because it's handy doesn't mean it's not a coping mechanism.   Either way, it's not necessarily bad writing if she doesn't explode at some point. Overusing that is actually pretty melodramatic in itself.

If this is your 4th ban, then there's a pattern of something that is causing this.   Keep in mind you can be banned for things besides swearing/chat violations.  Do you regularly go AFK, play for the other team, throw games, quick chat spam, or do other things that might cause people to consistently report you? If so, that could be the cause.  Do you have a friend who uses your account? If so they might be using chat in game and getting those bans.  Otherwise, there is a place on Psyonix's website where you can inquire if you think you've been wrongfully banned. 
Talking shit to your team mates can indirectly lose you games. People who play this game are pretty weak mentally. If you say "Wow you are absolute shit at this game" or anything alluding to that, you are helping your team lose the game by tilting your team mates. After you say something like that a lot of players think "Why should I even try to help this guy win? It's just one game, and I hate him now".  If that's the first thing you say, they don't have an option to mute you beforehand unless they just /mute all every game. They can mute everything that comes after, but they're probably tilted after the first message already.   You are being a bad team mate by flaming your team mates and being toxic in chat. You're not just saying bad things, you're ruining your chances of winning. Permabans are harsh, but I think banning repeat offenders is completely fine.

I was gonna make my 3x3 for manga adaptations, but it would literally just be [my favorite anime](http://i.imgur.com/qNZEFg1.jpg), except replacing Shirobako with Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, and I didn't think that would make for a very good 3x3.  So to stick with the manga theme, I've made a 3x3 of [anime that have convinced me to read the manga.](https://i.imgur.com/F65vugp.jpg) As it turns out, the corners are the ones I have actually read, and the others are ones that I have downloaded and plan to read.

I didn't used to dislike atheists, but on-line interactions are causing me to develop a prejudice against them. The reason is because they are rude and incapable of civil debate and discussion. They troll every discussion forum where people actually try to have substantial discussions and debates. Just look at ItsZachHere a few posts down. He refers to the Christian God as a "magical sky fairy." That is obviously just an attempt to be rude and get a rise out of Christians. The internet is full of people like ItsZachHere. They ruin any chance of having good productive conversations, and they do it everywhere they go.

Nice thought! The only thing I would recommend is that the designers of the trials would probably try and weed out someone trying to game the system by doing things that seem to demonstrate those principles but aren't being practical about it.  For example, a while ago I was asked to write an adventure for a Quaker summer school (that was a weird one) that had a similar theme - the party were tested on their various virtues. The final test was a wizardly riff on that bit from Indiana Jones &amp; The Last Crusade - the "this is the cup of a carpenter" bit.  The aim was to pick the staff used by the good Wizard. Obviously there lots of gaudy gold ones and ones with skulls on that were wrong choices. However, there was also a super-plain one that was basically just a tree branch that was *also* the wrong choice. The correct staff was the well-worn, practical one that wasn't showy but wasn't making a big point about being plain either.  I expect the knightly order would also be keen on those who make a big song and dance of appearing to meet the virtues without actually living them day-to-day.

I don't see why they would want to do that.  Jimmy may want to delay til after Ryan/Rodgers/Cousins deals are done.  And maybe delay to see what kind of tag he gets (exclusive or not). But after that he's got no reason to delay further.  All the cards will be on the table then, and everyone knows what the market situation is.  He's got to prefer to have a LTD inked when the season starts rather than play on the tag.  And the 49ers got no reason to delay til next season.  He won't be cheaper in a year even if his play regresses a bit, and he will cost a good bit more if he keeps balling out and makes a deep playoff run.  The only way it doesn't get done this year is if Jimmy wants the moon, or the 49ers are trying to cheap out.  Neither of those seems likely to me, but either one is bad for us 49ers fans.
looks like he prefired you after you killed someone from there what is broken?

Seeing a magenta sky sounds like the mirror finish Enchroma glasses from 4-5 years ago, colors got wonky near the edges of the lense, and trippy inside anywhere lit by fluorescent lights.   I picked up the Cx-25 and Cx-65 when they became available, but  they have refined the lenses once again so I don't know how well the new indoor glasses work compared to the 65s.  The Cx-65s work well, but they're not as balanced as the sunglasses. They block a lot of yellow light, Blues and reds become more vibrant. Green pops on a screen, but not anywhere else. Unlike the sunglasses the green traffic light does not change from white to green.
It was truly crazy how Gamergate was smeared. Gaming journalism was caught red-handed giving out favorable reviews for not only monetary compensation, but sexual favors. Its beyond disgusting that, not only did those outfits spin themselves to safety, but they got rewarded because of their alleged victim status... Fucking unbelievable.  Now every time its bought up on reddit, you see the same type of response: "It was just a bunch of unfuckable neckbeards angry at women playing games and so they created a coordinated harassment campaign."

I love Bourbon barrel aged stouts, yet I do not like bourbon alone at all.  I think if it’s added in the correct quantities it does enhance a beer.  I recently soaked cacao nibs in kraken rum (had no vodka) then threw in secondary.  The spice is a little strong, however it is a good “boozy” flavoured stout with a hint of chocolate lol.  Perhaps not what I had planned, but it will not go to waste on my shift 😁  Maybe take a finished beer in the style you are thinking and very lightly dose it in a glass to see what kind of flavour you get.  Add more if desired to the point where it’s If it’s good, chances are you can record the dose and scale to a batch.

Hey there, I have thick, Hispanic hair and usually get a little dandruff in the winter which I would clear with Head and Shoulders.  This was my first winter going no-poo and I had the worst dandruff I've ever experienced.  I found the best solution was to use no shampoo at all --shampoo is still drying -- and instead just use conditioner when the dandruff starts to get bad.  Hopefully ditching the shampoo for conditioner will help you out, too!

That isn't even a correct response.  By which definition are you a Socialist? It really isn't a hard question.
Alex Smith is an anomaly that turned from a near incompetent bust to an above average playoff QB. It took him 6 years to figure it out, he was marked down as a bust by like 2007 until Harbaugh came along in 2011. Goes to show how a little bit of good coaching goes a *long* way.  I remember there being debates on, "which starting QB is the worst in the league; Rex Grossman or Alex Smith?"

I'm in my mid 30s, been in the restaurant industry for 20 years, my roommate is a bartender, half my exes were bartenders. You're a guy who's claim to fame in this conversation is that you're sitting in a bar. Get a grip.
But WAS it dangerous, or do you only THINK it was dangerous because the anti-Trump media repeatedly told you everything he says is tyranny 24/7?  Tell a lie often and loudly enough, and the sheep will believe it.  Subs like this are an active and ongoing demonstration of the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Government workers aren't automatons:  they're people with all the same failings as you or I.  Given a sentence that vague, there's more than one interpretation you can pull from it, and it's clear the anti-Trump people are choosing to take it in the worst possible way, same as they do everything.  If Trump said he ate a bad ham sandwich, the media would say he's advocating for the abolishment of the FDA and trying to take over the meat industry.
Viewers may hate it, but they sure as hell still watch it. Which is ultimately all that matters in this business
Like definitely not the best thing to do but if you post something on social media most people should assume their mom might see it
Intentional draws and concessions both have to exist for the integrity of the game. Concessions need to exist because life exists outside of the tournament. If a player gets a call about an emergency during a match, they need to be able to leave the game. Likewise, intentional draws facilitate the tournament by allowing the players who know the best outcome for them is to draw to do so cleanly and out in the open rather than sit for 50 minutes refusing to attack or play relevant spells other than to advance the board state.
It's about having the hard copy. 
I wouldn't suggest playing this deck at rank 16 tbh. You mostly face aggro/smorc decks at that rank from my experience and you get rekt most of the time. This deck shines against control/combo decks such as cubelocks and raza priests.  I also don't like van cleef in this deck for some reason. Get evasion or doomsayer maybe. Double leeching poison is consistent but it ends up being a dead card in the long. It's personal preference I guess. 
If you live anywhere in the US, 2-3 days. Overseas is closer to two weeks about. And my apologies for the lack of a shipping confirmation, we will make sure to implement those from now on.

I never play pilot, so this isn’t a turkey voting against Christmas. Most pilots are thankfully useless. That’s probably why you’ve done it a few times, as have I.   This debate about fallacy is you failing to understand the pre-condition of my statement which said nothing about frequency. What I said was “a good pilot”. I didn’t say there were lots of them.   And before you dismiss this as inability on my part, and stats don’t say everything, but check mine out first.

I agree. The closest 911 would probably be the [991.2 (current-gen) Carrera 4](https://therpmjournal.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/porsche-991-2-rear.jpg), Carrera 4S, Targa 4, Targa 4S, Carrera 4 GTS, etc. with their narrow taillight strip between the larger lights on either side. Compare that to the [971 \(current-gen\) Panamera](http://cdn.hiconsumption.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2017-Porsche-Panamera-Turbo-4.jpg) and the [Neon](https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4552/39008006251_f3006eee7c_h.jpg), both of which have the brand name inside a black plastic trim piece as part of the taillight strip.

It's not because I'm uncomfortable with talking about sex. Like I said, I think that's fine. I mean, I grew up on a farm and I my Dad taught me the word 'ejaculate' when I was trying to describe goat sex and many informative conversations were had. My mom wasn't as open, but would readily answer any questions.   However, if my Dad told me about his personal sex toys or how he pleased my mother or that he had a modification done to his penis to please her more, I would be extremely uncomfortable. I'd like to differentiate between talking about sexual things in general and talking about yourself having sex.   It doesn't matter that I'm an adult woman and I know he has sex and we have good conversations about sexual things. I don't want to hear about my Dad having sex! And he doesn't want to tell me. Why would a father tell his daughter about his sex life? That's oversharing. 
I give it a 10
And?? I specifically said on block.

There's an upsetting vindictiveness in this Trumpian brand of conservatism that he's harnessing. They're looking at a woman who has been here since she was two years old, her young child, and her soldier fiancee that is risking his life for the sake of their country, and telling her that they have absolutely no problem upending their lives, separating them for up to 10 years, and putting the child in foster care while the guy is overseas wearing a US military uniform.   Like, what the fuck is at the heart of this malice? Why does she deserve that? What does it benefit them to destroy their lives like that? It's even counter-intuitive - deporting them costs resources. Letting her stay and become a nurse would allow her to work and pay taxes.

I heard that he wants a spot on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. If he leaves now, Trump can nominate him before 2020. 
I knew they would, everything I read about them was very good and they responded via email very quickly. 
I stayed days hard sleeping too, but not about I was really scared at all, but because a plenty of emotional feelings.  Sayori death made me sad and shocked first time because she is like a friend of mine in the same situation (that pretends is fine and hide his depression), and it made me dreamed she hanged himself before I knew it. Even today I check her every day cause this bad ending haunts me.  Natsuki, well, another friend of mine too who lives miles away in other side of country suffers on her family house, and the fact I'm very far, far away and cannot help makes me angry. I wish I could at least tell her to come here, but she's not legal age yet to leave her house.  Monika... Monika is Monika. At first I hated her because of everything she did, but latter I started to understand she, and now I wished she was real (at least an real AI) so I could have someone to talk... And my smartphone photo is her because of her eyes... That eyes... Okay, everyone.  And... Yuri. I loved Yuri at first glance. She is like me. When Monika twisted her on act 2, I was with a happy smile because I feel that way. I wish she was like real, and reminds me of a ex girlfriend who was a little like her, because she have borderline personality disorder, and the fact I have that too... I completely understand the pain/pleasure feeling and the uncontrollable feelings when loving someone. In less than a second I accepted her confession, because it gives me something inside that pleasures me...   I guess it's all.

Right,  apologies for earlier.  What i was making a balls of communicating was, as always,  the strange doublethink that some people here have.   .   Oh those polish guys want to look after their own first in their own country and do not want alien incompatible cultures,  it must be because they hate other nationalities and they are Nazis.  .   Versus .   Oh look at those polish "nazis". We must show them by violent means that their incompatible beliefs are not welcome here. We are heros and definitely nothing like Nazis.

I've stopped playing - I had a good 2-3000 hours in it though, and was an admiral in one of the larger player groups.  It's very much a make your own fun sort of game.

Yeah it’s def a different fan for the 2015 model compared to the 2013/2014 model but just because apple have a different part number for the fans it doesn’t necessarily mean they aren’t interchangeable, it’s a small risk but you should easily be able to get the 2015 fan from the part number I gave you from eBay.  I can’t say if the fan will fix your issue as liquid could have gone anywhere and damaged any component/sensor or a connector could have been corroded due to the liquid. If you take the base off and see any liquid you can clean it with contact fluid, look out for corrosion, clean that with contact fluid and a brittle brush or worse case scenario a clean make up brush if you have nothing else. The corrosion looks green ish usually. Good luck
Ah yes.. Own one now that fortunately is just keeping ahead in appreciation vs maintenance. 
&gt; Although it's a great camera, I think learning f-stop, ISO, shutter speed, etc might be a little much for a 13-year old.  I fucking **vehemently** disagree. Learning this stuff at an early age is super important and I really wish I had. I know plenty of kids who knew about the exposure triangle at young ages (between 10 and 14) and it *absolutely* gave them a leg up in learning and making informed decisions about shooting.

I also think this was intentionally done.  Having a fleet of these night stalkers would be incredibly overpowered if you weren't riding them.

Am professional programmer. It's a running joke in the community, but in my experience it's basically never the case in our actual development environment. I've seen the way some people write from being an interviewer, though, and a lot of people have awful debugging techniques and refuse to make test cases or step through code, and instead make a random change in the code, run it, and hope it works this time. That method is guaranteed to result in more bugs, sure.   Worst I've &gt;really&lt; had it is when I identify the bug, understand the cause of the bug, but the solution to fix the bug results in massive performance hits or a completely restructuring of the framework. In this case, we throw in some cheap fixes to mitigate the bug, understand it's a known issue, and have a plan for if the (very rare) edge case happens in a production environment somehow.

My parents are in the other camp, I think my depressive and anxious tendencies would be dramatically reduced if my stomach was in good health, because as a kid (all this started very slowly at age 10, I'm now 25 and only recently been diagnosed at 20) I never dealt with anxiety or depression.  They think I should just take antidepressants and antianxiety pills and call it a day. Really brings me down to hear but there's nothing I can do other than keep getting referrals to new gastroenterologists as all the ones I've gotten so far just pat me on the head and say "sorry you have IBS."

I'm not sure if i agree on the 400-600 per f8c as the ship is not regiftable as the glaive is.  and the f8c will be avialable for anyone who finishes SQ42.(maybe not with LTI but we dont know yet) the concerige one though yeah im sure that will be worth more than the original ship. so maybe 200 for the original f8c and 300 for the concierge version.

Compared to past games, I agree.    I also didnt know I could search for specific mons in the search criteria, should probably read more.   
I've been through therapy for about 5 years (we all mutually ended my sessions with both my psychiatrist and social worker in 2015 due to significant improvement), and I've been on anti-depressants for about 7-8 years. Now, I only get full-on depressive episodes 1-2 times a year, and they can be described as mild-moderate (most of the time), and I would say that I probably don't really suffer from dysthymia since my treatments. My mental health treatment (re: medication) has been transferred to my MD.  While the medication + therapy has helped immensely with my depressed mood, there are still some lingering issues from my depression &amp; anxiety that are not resolved, such as low motivation, low energy, and I can be easily overwhelmed by chores/cooking (among other things, but these are the most relevant problems).   I find that I can function decently well in certain areas of my life (especially in comparison to how it used to be before my hospitalization ~8 years ago), but in other areas of my life I struggle significantly (namely home-life, self-care including eating/cooking, exercising, hygiene, etc.).   I'm not sure what a top house cleaning service is, but I'll look into it, thanks! I think you're right though on what I need - that's what I feel like I need as well, but I don't know where to look or who would offer those kinds of services. My family currently helps me out by coming over whenever it gets really bad to help me with groceries/cooking/cleaning, but as terrible as it sounds, I would really like to become more self-sufficient or at least less of a burden on my family. They're not getting paid for the countless times I've asked for help (nor would they accept payment), and I want them to stay as my family - not turn into half-family, half-caretakers.  Ideally, obviously I would love to be able to transition to being able to do all of this myself. But it would help a lot to get some outside help during that transition. I want to be able to get off ODSP and function at least reasonably well, and as corny as it sounds, become a contributing member of society.  Thank you so much for your advice, I appreciate it greatly! :)
done and thanks

I sprayed hairspray all around the toilet seat, turned the light out, and lit it on fire. It was pretty cool. Then by the time I put the blue fire out, the seat had melted slightly on the surface.

Kelly's offensive scheme was decent for the most part, but the way he ran it totally gassed the defense. They went from like last in time of possesion to first after they fired him and the defense went from like bottom 10 to top 10.

no idea about actual RP or italian servers, but there are ways to get gold from one server to another, but not really in an equal way.   You can buy a token with gold on your current server, transfer it to BNET balance, then use your bnet balance to buy a token from in game shop and sell that token on the AH.   You can also buy pets on your current server, then cage them on a different server and sell them. This way is riskier and depends on ppl looking for specific pets.

Absolutely, in nearly every conversation. 
Didn't Albenis base his (piano) music on raw folk melodies? Most notably the famous Asturias (composed for piano in the first instance BTW but made famous by guitar). Awesome piece. Henle do urtext of it.  If you are a fan of Russian folk music, playing anything Tchaikovsky will have lots of motifs there to start with. He also apparently did "50 Russian folk songs arranged for four hands". Good luck finding a printed edition though! In case of struggle, here is one which it says "public domain". http://imslp.org/wiki/50_Russian_Folk_Songs_(Tchaikovsky,_Pyotr)  Mussorgsky "Pictures from Exhibition" is the pillar of Russian music, not sure how much of it is based on folk though. The opening Promenade definitely has that feel to me. The closing Grand Gates of Kiev is based on old Russian church music tradition as far as I can tell and definitely has folk motifs to it.  Nikolai Rakov did some stuff based on folk. His ABRSM Grade 3 piece "der tag ist vergangen" is awesome and super Russian to me (good luck finding half-decent performance of it!). I call it "Russian chillout", if you play it right. He also did a thing called "Legend", which is straight off a folk song as far as I can hear. Reference performance: https://youtu.be/1Jj61FPUkEQ  Of course, Liszt did his Rhapsodies based on Madyar folk tunes didn't he? If you can play them :)  Edit: ABRSM Grade 3 piece "donkey has died" is an arrangement of famous children's Spanish folk song "Ya se murio el burro". Very sad, very nice. My daughter still refuses to play it because "I'm so sad about the poor donkey" lol :))

Normally, I would give a person a second chance to go home and change but this dude argued with me that he was dressed just fine for the job. I told him he was fired right then and there.

Depending on the app, a profile pic doesn't have to show your face. Heck, you don't necessarily have to have a profile pic at all (I don't). Some guys will shun you for it, but not all, and you can chat for a bit before deciding if you're comfortable enough to show your face.  If you're only worried about being seen by someone you know, though, you could also make first contact and go ahead and send a face pic (assuming you're contacting a guy who has one, so that you've already seen it is not someone you know).

Yeah. And I understand that part which is why I'm fine with the maximum authorization of a year.   What I'm not fine with is being able to be taken off the program by the head doctor at the closest clinic. I can imagine they get some flak for wait times. So i can see them fitting me in to pull me off the program. The less people in their area on the program; the better they look.   If the doctor is a prick I can see them doing this. But then if I need another appointment in two weeks. Guess what? The wait times will still likely be over a month and I'm back on the program. Which I would certainly just reapply for. And for the amount of veterans in my area there is no way they could realistically keep fitting people in without pushing other appointments back. It just seems like a mess. I really hope this doctor just approves it and doesn't mess with me. BTW. I'm rated at 70%.  Edit: grammar

A clanmate of mine has this issue occasionally at his work and it has happened to me a few times in a certain location in my apartment. It does seem to be related to WiFi connectivity but it appears to me that CoC (and Boom Beach) is just more sensitive than usual to dips in signal strength. I don't have issues with anything else on WiFi from that same location including other games and youtube.
What’s so bad about wizard? And if you’re going to just shit on my deck like that, I’d rather you have more constructive criticism or how to improve it. 
From Dusk till Dawn was "[banned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_censorship_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland) due to its demonic representations such as Salma Hayak's character".  I think [this is the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiCjUNI1GC0) they're referencing (spoilers for a 22 year old film).
I would hesitate on Marc ALONE for TT Shump and the Nets pick. Ya'll are really overvaluing a pick that is looking to be in the 6-10 range... Either that or undervaluing how much a net negative two guys who look disinterested for a true contender and are on huge contracts are. If we had a top 3 lock on that shit, sure, but the nets pick is almost certainly not gonna be in that range.

There's little risk of being buried on this sub. Many of the threads are downvoted and there's not so much traffic that you'll get pushed too far back. That said, your request is really high for this sub, and there's also a tendency to buy things rather than give money. Most of the requests that are fulfilled are for purchases that are under $100.   Not to say you should stop trying, but you should start working other angles offline and through other channels.

First point: cause then you’d be down 3 X-wings regardless. Did you not see rogue one where hyperspace ships splat like bugs on the windshield of Vader’s star destroyer? Not only that, Leia establishes with Poe that she’s not looking to lose people for no reason  Second point: yes the Raddus broke the supremacy, but remember the raddus was enormous too. The rebels had access to basically zero during the battle of Yavin, and were on the verge of having their main base destroyed   Third point: I can see why you have a problem with this, but I just don’t share the same sentiment. It’s probably an age thing, I didn’t grow up with the originals and so I guess I can’t speak to this point  Fourth point: The damage from the light speed kamikaze was devastating, yes, but it wasn’t like the entire supremacy exploded. I can see them bringing it back as a base of operations, albeit under intense repair. This further solidified my first point, a hyperspace kamikaze didn’t fully destroy the supremacy with a 3500 meter long ship, what makes you think the rebellion could have blown up the Death Star the same way with the much tinier ships they had at the time?

What he doesn't tell you is that Seoul will be destroyed an hour after he starts.  The question is what terrible price will be exacted to do so. These Generals don't discuss that price which makes all of this much more terrifying.  
Fat fucker named brian will eat anything thats left out even if you have told him not to.

The dynamic keyword in C# is what I meant, in case it was unclear, not dynamic typing in general. It's weird when you have a statically typed language like C# and then include the dynamic keyword feature, as I believe it is counter-intuitive for someone who uses your code and isn't expecting it to do any dynamic magic in an otherwise statically typed language.

The first vehicle (the one that isn't duped) should be the only one with insurance on it. Walk near your car and hit the button that brings up the player list, (I think it's down on dpad for ps4/xb1 and it's Z for pc) it will tell you which cars have insurance.   About only duping the original, I'm not sure if you **need** to dupe the original. I was but I was scared of losing the real car so I switched to duping a dupe. So far it seems to be working but if there are any issues with that, please someone let me know.

&gt; A situation that is relatively common in such long races.  A situation that is a failure of BoP with the explanation of "we're looking over the course of the season."  This is how you create the pervasiveness of the feeling that every new race was "just marque X's turn," and why it should be mitigated at all costs. In fact, over 24 hour races, I would not be opposed to in race balance changes.  One perfect example of this would be declared pressure, which very obviously changed over the course of the Rolex and could easily have impacted things.  What you've described can often describe the stale nature of WEC GTE Pro pre-auto balance, where you could determine bar incident who will win that race by hour 2.  If I wanted to watch marques run 2x2 I'd watch F1.

I adore Android 13 so I’m with you there 😂. Honestly I’d prefer they stayed away from any and all GT characters, and due to it being written out of canon i would actually say it would be highly unlikely anyway.  More women fighters would be awesome, the problem is there simply aren’t that many to chose from in the Dragon Ball universe. Pan is still a baby in Super and Videl is totally a must have, you’re spot on with that! They could do Kale or Caulifia because i don’t think the dub being caught up is really a big deal, i mean hell Goku Black is in it with Future Trunks and the dub is only at the first tournament, they haven’t even been introduced yet afaik.  Pilaf, Mai and Shu could be interesting as a trio, but it may be a bit too silly for the game currently with such a small roster, it’s not really at Tenkaichi levels of crazy yet. That being said however, Future Mai could be fucking cool!

Even if it is a hollow door it can buy you some time to escape and slows down the spread of fire. Even if it only gives you 30 more seconds that is 30 more seconds escape and 30 more seconds for the fire dept to arrive to hopefully extinguish the fire and save more of the house. 
Yup, a 10 is more than enough room for shrimp and snails! The shrimp may become betta snacks though, it depends on their personality.   The only cories you *could* stock in a 10g with a betta would be pygmy cories, but having done that in the past, it felt too cramped to me and the cories were moved to a larger tank.

good luck tracking xmr. There are always weak points,  but in the case of xmr it's not that easy. Want to remind people to churn at least a few times before spending from amounts you received from a KYC/AML exchange. It's even better to periodically fill your xmr wallet and always keep some value in your wallet. Don't spend directly. This will mitigate most risks.    edit: for eexample when you tend to spend 200 USD worth of xmr each month, start with buying 500 USD worth of XMR and buy 200 USD every month   edit2: "month" should NOT be every 1st day of the month. Change it up a little. Sometimes you buy the 25th, somtimes the 7th...

Based on what you've provided, assuming the neighbors live further down the road, consider paving the road up to the junction with your driveway and ignore the rest.  I don't see anything that requires you to maintain the easement, it's generally about not preventing access.  Typically the easement user, in my experience, is responsible for upkeep.  
Yeah I don’t think having an anime harem is as appealing as it sounds. Just pick one or none. Let it go on long enough and there will be lots of unnecessary drama. Especially if all the girls start to believe you like them. Developing feelings for every girl in said harem doesn’t sound likely

When doing drills and manually racking the slide everything worked fine. But when I would put a snap cap in the middle of a live magazine it was ejected out with the spent casing above it.

Its not their fault, its a known deficiency of the ERC20 spec. Basically you can send EOS to a contract, but there is absolutely no way for a contract to know who sent the EOS, when, how much, etc. and any mechanism that would have allowed them to know this would inevitably compromise the decentralization of the token.  This problem is addressed in the newest token spec.
I’d love to hear the rationale behind this. (Completely neutral statement).

I do think FE6's popularity in Japan played a role in Roy's popularity. But, I do agree it isn't the most popular since I think FE4 sold better and Sigurd and Seliph were non-existent on the original top 20 poll.   Blazing Sword definitely is one of the most popular games in the community. It got Lyn the #1 female spot by a large margin and Hector the #3 spot. I don't know about Japan, but I imagine FE7 was popular there too if not more popular than FE6.
Well, I was basing the cpu choices on something Mod Dark said a while back. You commented on the same thread, too. This: https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/6atw1r/a_post_for_any_of_the_lurking_nxt_devs/   Mod Dark said:   &gt;As whosdr said the GPU underutilisation is due to it being starved by the CPU, but obviously it is an issue on our end if a 7700k can't keep up! So, I was kinda assuming that the more the gpu has to demand, the better the cpu has to be.

Jealousy is not a useful feeling to posess, however it can be hard for the person feeling it to control. The way you present your perspective on the issue at hand, makes it seem like you have a girlfriend who has found an aggressive and negative outlet for her strong emotions of jealousy - snooping. I am in no way justifying her behaviour, what I am trying to do is find a reason for her doing it. Is she sad because you at some point have shown a reason for her to distrust you? Do you feel like you can trust her? What do you mean when you say she only snoops when she is angry? What made her angry? Is she a jealous person in general (wishing to have lifestyles of other people etc.)? Personally I do abselutly not believe her behaviour is appropriate when considering the reasons you have mentioned in which she believes it is okay for her to be snooping about. To me it sounds like a scream for help. How is your relationship in other areas? Have you considered that she has this behaviour because of the fact that she doesn't feel truly loved by you? That she doesnt feel safe and sound in your relationship (ie. That she feels you wont screw or look for other women). Consider spending half a day reading or listening (aprox. 6 hours) to The Five Love Languages by Dr. Chapman. In this book Chapman explains that many reasons for the emotions of jealousy is the fact that the partner does not feel loved sufficiently in the language of love they speak. The book has been very helpful in my personal life, and might be helpful to yours as well. Anyway, to resolve you issue I urge you to sit down and talk to specifics with her:  Talk about the WHY. Talk about the very specific reasons WHY she snoops and spies on you. If you love this woman and maybe want a future with her, you can try to put in some work here and help her become a better person, and at the same time remove this strain from your relationship. I'm not suggesting you need to completly reshape or change another human being, but by explaining why her behaviour is unfair to you, you are then making room for new and more positive thinking, such as trust or unconditional love. You must have a conversation about her snooping (duh). You should expres your genuine love for her. You should expres you deep concern for her behaviour and explain how it affects you and how her lack of trust puts a strain on your relationship. Try to explain exactly why she always can trust you. (bring positive and strong examples of your mutual trust and why her actions are unfair to you). You then need to develop a comfortable way of communicating that you boudaries have been crossed every single time she crosses them. Which is around 7 times and counting. I notice other comments here suggest putting password on everything and dumping her. What does that solve? It solves nothing. Now she will find another, possibly even more negative outlet for her jealous emotions. What I am trying to get at, is that you need to figure out what the root cause for her behaviour is, and then try to talk to her about it - maybe by using some of the previously mentioned suggestions. I wish you a great week and best of luck to you. Be a problem solver by communicating, not by blocking her out with fresh passwords and dumping her. Right now you already know how much work you want to put in. Try doing a little bit more than that. And then some. If she fails to understand you time and time again when you explain the issues she create with her behaviour, she fails to love you.

I've had a zojirushi for several years and recently got an instant pot. The instant pot rice is nowhere near as good. That being said, are you leaving it on warm after cooking?   Are you having humidity changes where you store the rice?   If you're reusing it as a leftover, how are you reheating it?

&gt; My big issue with line of thinking is, you don't need 600k to live on 25k and do construction and part-time real estate.   It's about stability, and not HAVING to do construction or real estate. If you HAVE to do those things, you have to worry about the construction and real estate markets. And then it's also a job, and not a hobby. This way you can do whatever you happen to want to do and have no worries if things change. Also that's 25k a year after the house is paid off.     Additionally, alot of that lifestyle of living off 25k is enabled by having the time to do things yourself.

My friend has one of those. I like to wear it on my index finger and give a regular handshake to friends, then extend the index with the tiny hand to gently rub/scratch their wrist. Freaks them out XD

Yeah, they're two different flavors entirely, both quite good in my opinion, though I do prefer real crab if I can get it. I feel like it'd be pretty strange to have real crab in a California roll, for example.

British cars kinda ruined it, yeah.  UK built a lot of bad cars in the 60s and 70s, exported a fair few too so people all over the world got to experience them.  In some areas British stuff is good though.  Most of it is vintage/legacy though (tools, think sheffield steel)... modern British engineering is pretty high tech stuff though, I mean Rolls Royce jet engines have a good rep.  Still lots of cars built in the UK, they're just not British companies anymore.

I've been watching some ENT episodes lately also.  Really liking the art direction compared to DSC.  Coveralls and flat screens, gun metal gray narrow corridors.  They must have put a higher priority on making the visual style fit as a prequel to TOS.

I've been a huge Power Rangers fan since childhood and when we starting making Power Rangers books I jumped on it right away! I've designed all the books we've done so far and I love it. Your manuscript was really playful and fun, so it made designing it that much more enjoyable. Again, congratulations on this being your first outing. It's super exciting.

Companies that profit from selling food to people generally try not to give them any reason to not buy food there.  Telling people that they were nearly given a bacterial infection by eating there isn't a great business decision.
After politely asking what kind of wedding dress/style I was thinking for my upcoming wedding, my future MIL offered to buy me a headpiece from a particular etsy shop (she knows the artist who runs it). After checking it out they are gorgeous and in the style I had in mind, and even if they weren't she made it extremely clear that I can go ahead and do my own thing if it's not the style/accessory I want and I should not feel obligated to go with it just because she suggested it.  Wedding stuff is expensive and I will definitely be taking her up on that offer because I want to feel like a flowery princess on my wedding day.

To be fair, I'd be pissed off if they kept the same amount of commercials as normal football.  I can only take them promoting the WWE Network so many times an hour and it's more annoying when they throw the promo into the middle of a match.

Robert has dreamed of this moment his entire life. The moment when he gets to be the hero. There were kids who loved superheroes, then there were super hero nerd, and then at the top of the pile, there was Robert. A stronger word even than obsessed feels appropriate here. Until an embarrassingly mature age (to which Robert would never admit!), he truly believed he was born on Krypton. He would scour the neighbourhood on his bike, self-fashioned cape billowing behind him. Despite the few occasions where his cape got caught in his wheels and sent him unceremoniously over the handlebars of his trusty steed, Super Robert persisted. Not on his watch, would anything untoward happen in his neck of the woods.   So here we are, in the present day. With a semi-retired 23 year old Super Robert bearing witness to a young lady being swept downstream, clearly in need of help. And who better to step in, then the boy who grew up a super hero. He had trained for this moment his whole life. Well, kind of – Robert wasn’t the world’s strongest swimmer. But hey, he was a super hero, it would all work out.   Robert leapt into action, closing the distance between the two quickly, until he was sprinting along the bank next to the woman. Her eyes wide with panic, she reached out a hand desperately towards Robert, screaming incoherently. Using his well-honed skills, Robert identified a part of the bank with a large tree he could anchor himself to, and rushed towards it. Gripping the tree tightly with his right arm, he leant out towards the woman and managed to grab her by the wrist. The current was stronger than he realised, but not too strong - never too strong for Super Robert.   He could see it now, the adoring public, Robert speaking humbly to the TV presenter. The one on one interview with Ellen, where she brought out Henry Cavill to present him with his very own cape. The boy who loved Superman like no other, who became a hero himself.   But we must go back to the present, where Robert has just managed to extract the terrified young woman from the river. She threw her arms around him dramatically and sobbed into his chest. She was playing her part perfectly. Finally, she pulled herself together enough to speak.  “Thank you, oh God thank you, I thought I was a goner for sure. Can I… Can I borrow your phone please? I have to call Johnny and let him know I’m OK.”  Robert raised an eyebrow, who was Johnny? No it couldn’t be a boyfriend, that’s not how it’s supposed to work. He was the hero, and the hero gets the girl. Always. Super Robert always gets the girl. Robert stood slowly and wandered closer to the river. He spied his wallet, pinned against a log in the shallows.   “Could you give a hand? I dropped my wallet, but it’s caught on a log here. Can you just step out quickly and grab it? It’s OK, I’ll be holding you the whole time, you can trust me.” The girl hesitated, obviously with no appetite to re-enter the water. But what could she say? This guy had just saved her life. But there was something about the intensity of his gaze, which unsettled her.   “Um, OK… But hold on tight!”  Robert smiled, “I’ve got you.”  She stepped into the shallows, and felt the strength of the current, which had already drained all her strength. She shuddered, but reached out slowly towards the wallet. He had a strong grip on her arm, it was hurting her, but it was her lifeline – so she didn’t mind.   “So, this Johnny, he’s your brother?”  “I’ve almost got it. What? Um, no – Johnny is my boyfriend.”  For some reason, she didn’t want to tell him that. It shouldn’t matter, but there was something about his eyes, those eyes…  Robert flinched. No, that was wrong. She can’t have a boyfriend; Super Robert always gets the girl.   “I’ve got it! OK, pull me in.”  She held the wallet up triumphantly. He wasn’t even looking at her now though, and she felt her hand slipping. His death grip was loosening. She felt her hand sliding through his.   “I’m slipping, quick – pull me back in!”   Robert glanced back at her, stirred from his thoughts. No more adoring public, no more Ellen. This wasn’t how it was supposed to go.   “Please, I’m slipping – help me!”  His grip loosened further, he wasn’t even holding her anymore. Her hand slide from his and she toppled backwards over the log, at the mercy once more of the current. She got one last look at those eyes as she was swept away, but there was nothing behind them now, just emptiness.   Robert turned away, shoulders slumped. That wasn’t how it worked, Super Robert always gets the girl…

Considering they equated animal abuse to slavery and put up billboards in the middle of Detroit implying going vegan would lower the crime rate, their euthanasia stance is, like, the *eighth* worse thing about them.
If anything, the fact the UN is cautioning the Federal Government for their welfare policies is just going to make them want to drive harder at screwing this country's most vulnerable into the ground. Corporate welfare, that's ok though. Make a profit as a private citizen, and the government deems you should get nothing (or, worse, don't make a profit as a private citizen, then they'd rather give you less than nothing). Make a profit as a company, and you're worthy of further bankrolling from government.

Yeah, I don't think Tesla is anywhere near 10K per disengagement and maybe not even near 1K per disengagement. If reports are true, they're more like 0.1K per disengagement and this is for highway driving. I'd love to have a Waymo/Tesla matchup on surface streets and see what the numbers are.
I agree, and I quite enjoyed the movie. It was just something very separate from the book with some really cool scenes that were lifted straight from the pages.

That’s because the original comment, “Oh no, they have to do their fucking jobs.  What a tragedy” assumes they know what the job of physicians should entail. I’m sorry but a court ruling on a matter doesn’t mean it’s right. Does that mean when there are judges in Trumps administration rule that funding should be cut to pro choice organizations that it’s right then? 
I am not sure of that. Even if it's that's true today doesn't mean it will be true in the future.  Also the right lives on dissatisfaction so they foster an environment of  hostility, fear mongering, racism and violence.

King will always be studied by students of the 20th Century.  His books are views into an important aspect of American life in that era and, of course, King himself came to be an important aspect of the pop culture of that era. It's inevitable that he'll retain a spot on *someone's* reading list.
So people with dissenting opinions aren't welcome here or shouldn't be allowed to be here?

"And boss Carlos Carvalhal feels the 29-year-old attacking midfielder will bring fresh qualities to his squad.  Carvalhal has stressed throughout the January window that he was not interested in adding new signings for the sake of it, and believes King’s attacking instincts will give the Swans a different option."   Sorry but what the fuck? In what world does that describe Andy King even on a good day?

&gt;1) Why and what does it mean to build/make a full project? Why can't you just download it and use it?  Not quite sure what you mean here. If you mean why are you supplying the source as well as the binaries, it's so that others can modify / build from what you produce. It also allows you to version control using GitHub as you're working on it.  Some people include the generated binaries in their repos, typically in a target or dist file. In that sense you could download and run the project easily rather than need to make it from scratch.  &gt;2) What's the general rule on what to keep in the src folder?  Any source files for the project. Typically resources such as config files, test sources, and binary files generated from the build process should not be in the src file.  &gt;3) We are using caffe2 and have it installed. Should we include it in the project files or should we expect users to install it themselves? Sort of references question 1.  I would expect this not to be included in the project files if it's not a library dependency directly referenced in your code. However the readme should document the dependency.

Wasting your kids' time is substantially less of a government issue than cutting up their genitals (which, while low risk, is not zero risk. Unnecessary surgery should never, ever be performed without informed consent).  Also, you simply haven't looked at the evidence of botched procedures. Surgery is inherently dangerous, as are pain medicine, as is not using pain medicine. It's not open heart surgery dangerous, but circumcision does result in permanent disfigurement (not counting a successful operation as disfiguring, mind you), and every once in a great while, death.  I'd argue that while adults have the right to risk serious injury or death for any reason, or no reason, parents should not be able to do so for their own children.

It will take tons of money to renovate a single campus to meet their needs. You'd literally be unscrewing seats out of the floor to accommodate them. Libraries can't rearrange books either. If you're using LoC or Dewey, popular reading will be where it needs to be, even if that includes a ladder. Cafeterias won't change because either way, there will be a rush. Just deal with it.   Being fat is not a disability. It's not stopping you from anything, and it is rarely something you can't control. Don't act like you deserve more simply because you're bigger.
