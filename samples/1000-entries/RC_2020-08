If you want to work in video game industry, why do you want to work as ALT and let your skills rot? Isn‚Äôt it will be better to get a job in relevant industry in your country, gain some experience and then try to get hired by a Japanese gaming company instead of taking ALT detour?
This is the first time I had to go full rebuild but yea
Thing is if I try 5Ghz it will only be stable with Extreme and 4.9Ghz can handle Turbo anything less will crash at some point. Any ideas? I'm going insane lol - I can't find a healthy 5Ghz setting, maybe it's something I'm missing or not getting..
Lol same that‚Äôs so clever lol
Thank you :)

This is r/VisibleMending, of course you can fix it!  Post pics when you‚Äôre done, please!
you look a tad overweight. Loosing a few body fat %. Will help your confidence and looks.  You got nice healthy hair. work on managing it better and u will be doing good.  &amp;#x200B;  But not ugly... Just work on what i said and u will be doing well.

Oh yes they can. And when the PoPo start sniffing around the neighborhood you know it's time to dial it back a bit. I followed the same "downsize" philosophy in a different direction. Bought a scooter with way less horsepower. Still hair on fire fun but in a much lower speed bracket.

I have recently been looking for something myself, but didn't know where to start either and everything I've come across is very thoughtlessly manufactured. Thank you for asking and to those who have replied!
No, I just have some stupid throwing stars.
Yeah but a lot of people seem to be having a problem with traps after the player dies, doesn‚Äôt mean all the ideas are perfect, and it‚Äôs more of a discussion, I‚Äôd prefer just have traps back how they was, but there‚Äôs are a few problems people seem to comment on so I wanted to add solutions to them, prefer have something constructive and comments on this rather than pick at one thing you disagree with, the game isn‚Äôt going to progress if everyone stays silent and doesn‚Äôt say what they want in the game and thinks will work, it‚Äôs more ideas to get epics attention and give ideas as the game feels stale to a lot of people
I‚Äôve lived in both. Raleigh is solid. City is nice. Weekends to Asheville or Wilmington. Wilmington and Myrtle Beach are great if you‚Äôre a 28 year old slut. Just avoid Fayetteville.

This is just proof that these reviews are highly subjective.  Go look at the reviews for book one, they are just gravid with complaints about the mouth noises and spit sounds.  I bought it and was massively disappointed. Could not make it past Chapter 5.
&gt; Im a leftist, and an atheist and they know this.   Be careful. By itself those do not make you immune from finding pleasure in believing one or more of these things:  * That you are better than other people because they are an out-group  * That people in power are lying to you  * That a 'day of reckoning' will come (and the winner will be you!)  These are the kinds of teachings that cults entice people with. And leftist atheists can fall for them too -- 9/11 trutherism affected people who were critical-thinking atheists. Just think about angry atheists: they believe they're better than the out-group of religious people, don't trust those national governments that push religion and believe that, eventually, religion will die because it is so abhorrent to reason. That ticks off all those points above. I'm not lying when I say that I could definitely see a charismatic individual convincing some percentage of such believers into becoming True Believers of some constructed ideology.  Ideology has benefits (most often ones imagined within the mind of the person who adopts the ideology) and costs (most often when the ideology is used to shape the world and a lack of nuance does damage). Ideology is found in right-wing and left-wing beliefs. Ideology is found in religion and in atheism. Be careful.
Nta. Your grandparents are awesome for suing her... Your dad would probably "work it out" by grounding them and you wouldn't get anything out of it.

&gt; Why, exactly, could the cops not come approach him slowly to put him in handcuffs instead of barking orders at him?   Because cops in the USA are trained to never risk their own lives in any situation. Unlike firefighters and soldiers, cops can opt out of their responsibilities if they fear for their lives.

I think this is true, even if only partially.

If you're comfortable modifying your keyboard mapping, `Workspace&gt;Show Panel In Workspace` for the Inspector is the "menu bar item" you're looking for when you remap.  `Workspace&gt;Active Panel Selection` to activate the Inspector is CMD/CTRL+9 by default, but won't hide it. I've remapped my CMD+9 keyboard shortcut to "Show Panel In Workspace" and that's solved it.  Seems like this is the second time you've asked this - did this solution not work before?
Caller said he had a gun, and that he had the weapon to his lady friend's head. Some are saying he was swatted.   If you are non compliant, making attempts to flee, and police think you are a threat (which was reasonable assumption given a witness report provided to dispatcher of an armed hostage taker) then they have a right to use force to stop you. Had he complied with officers immediately he would have walked away without so much as a ticket.  Never attempt to flee from police. They will assume you are dangerous and will do everything they can to catch you. And this is the right way to do it, because if you're dangerous, and desperately trying to escape, you may hurt/kill someone else.  This video is also not very objective and seeks to stoke racial tensions. Clearly the officers did not want to kill him, and gave him multiple opportunities to surrender before he chose to felony evade resulting in his shooting.   Oh and the human dogshit who made the call needs to be found and charged with murder. Their lies directly contributed to this man's death.

Y3 heroes. Heroes from year 3. That year. Heroes which were released during year 3. As in the one after year 2 but before year 4. Those Heroes, as in characters that we can play in this computer game that we all paid like $50 for and have played for hundreds of hours.  Year 3. Heroes. Year 3 heroes.  Year 3.  Heroes.  Year 3 heroes.  (Year 3 heroes, just in case I didn't already write it or make it clear, they said it for year 3 heroes)  **Year 3 heroes**  ^^^^year ^^^^3 ^^^^heroes  *year 3 heroes*  If I look on your previous comments and I going to find any complaints about PK or valk being gender locked or did you just decide to get upset about this particular thing? Because if it's this much of an issue to you surely you'd have seen the number of gender locked characters when you first saw the game and decided that it was a hard pass. Because, you know, it's such an issue to you. Which is fine! Because you feel strongly about it and always have, which is why you've never played a match with any gender locked characters without quitting out of a sense of duty and why you've never played as any gender locked characters yourself.  Because it's such an issue, for you. Of course.

I see what you mean. But it's still not that that good, I find lots of people that like it (I also like it) but it's still over all not that good. There are normies who try to act cool by saying it's bad but theres also people who just hate it.

there was one tweet that made me laugh, "a bunch of comedians and Brandun Schaub have tested positive for Covid-19" I dont hate the guy, but hes not funny. I feel being funny where you can be a stand-up comedian takes a special level of funny. To me, Chris D'eila had that special talent...look where he's at right now. Cancelled.
Sure ya didn't.   He tells it like it is! Also he didn't mean that!  You guys are pathetic.

It was a mixed bag. I started my Couch to 5K program two weeks ago and I'm seeing results. Started back up meeting with my trainer in person rather than on Zoom. But my eating hasn't been on point. Lots of stress surrounding what our school district was going to decide about reopening. I didn't even realize how stressed I was until we went on a vacation to a lake cabin a few weeks ago. School just released their plan, and I'm feeling more settled. Hoping I can continue the good workouts and improve my food choices.

It's not just Castro, although he stablished a precedent and was involved in the development of most of the radical leftists groups in LatAm.

Listen buddy you have my appreciation for what you do even if I don't use your APK many others will and I'm assuming it makes you happy to know that what you're doing people appreciate it by using it unless you're doing it for yourself then why advertise that you're making one just make it for yourself and that's that. Believe me I give all the props to any Dev that has anything to do with these apks because I'm sure a lot of work has to go into it and 99% of the time it's on your own dime unless you're charging for your app which only a couple people and if an APK came out that was good enough for me to pay monthly I would definitely do it but I won't do it for any of the ones that are out now because they have tons and tons of TV shows and movies on their apps but a lot of them don't get any links so you can't watch them. I wish I knew how to make an APK or app because the way I would do it if it's possible that is and I also know it would probably take a lot of time to do and I might even charge a dollar or $2 per month depending how good it was. I would either make a  click and play with no links click on the movie or TV show and there you go or I would make sure that any TV show or movie that was on my app every one of those would be able to be watched because there would be links to all the TV shows and movies, if I couldn't find links then the shows won't be on there no one has come out with one like that it's probably not possible or just too much work but then again that's why someone could get away with charging 1- $2 per month and people would have no problem with it. If you've heard of cyberflix that's a clone of an older app called terrarium several years ago it was the best thing out It got shut down but cyberflix is said to be used by 20 million users that's a lot of  1- $2 LOL keep up the good work stay safe.
Personally, I love LA because it feels a little less suburban than OC, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with OC. More of my life is centered around things that are in LA even if it is more expensive.

Reserve 100gb max. Should be more than enough, because you should only use Windows if a course demands it (probably only need it for VS). If a course does not demand it: stay on MacOS. Unix based operating systems are much more suited for programming. You have more and better tools available and it‚Äôs easier to configure stuff. (Plus macOS will perform so much better on your Mac than windows)
Could be rotten gps coverage.  Have the adventure sync turned on and it helps when the game is not open.
News flash: police are allowed to shoot a fleeing suspect if they believe them to be dangerous, because people have escaped police custody and killed innocent people before, also wtf do you think the officers were supposed to do to verify that there‚Äôs no gun in the car? Take his word for it? Just assume that since they can‚Äôt see a gun on him that there‚Äôs obviously not one in the car?   I didn‚Äôt think it was all that hard to understand that if police believe you to be a threat they will shoot you because it‚Äôs better to kill  someone with potentially malicious intent than gamble on wether or not that person will go off to kill someone else.

Every class can solo this game.  If you and your three pals all want to play mages, thats completely fine.  Your tactics will be different than a traditional F/C/T/W group, your thinking when leveling up to pick ability points and feats will be different.  Such as Ambush and Quadra Fireball tactics, or Flyby Quadra Fireball, or Quadra Storm of Vengeance, or Quadra Gate. A pure mix of Stealth and Magic, such as in your case, could merit from this type of Ambush/Trap combat.   Your Rogues should get buffed with greater invisibility and haste, to dish out sneak attack damage and your enemies should be CC'd with Webs/Grease, AOE etc, while you all summon conjured creatures at them. In a pinch, Polymorph someone into a tank.   With Animate Objects spell you can animate 10 individual objects to act independently of each other and attack your enemies. Thats 10 enemy attacks tanked, unless theyre ignored in which case thats 10 attacks with +6 to hit 1d8 + 2 damage damage every turn.  I think play what you want to play, figuring out solution to obstacle is best part of game.   Having a tank means sometimes AOE or Stealth tactics are useless due to Dude-In-The-Way-Wearing-Clanging-Metal.  Worst (best?) case scenario just go Awaken/Helm of Intelligence a tanky animal (Gorilla?), get it barding (Gorilla sword? Gorilla SHIELD!?), and bring your new DMpet along as meatshield.
Pine rosin is also a problem. Ive personally had some fire wax cut with it and it smelt like burnt candle wax after 1 sec of it being in a banger
Ends too soon
Null Follow-up is a premium skill released extremely late because Surtr was just unbearable.   The difference is requiring a rare skill to counter follow ups or requiring a single stat to counter damage reduction. Apparently the inheritable skill (NFU) allows backwards compatibility with old units and speed is only available on new units (known as speedcreep?). But wasting a B slot on an old unit just so that they can double wouldn‚Äôt help them much against powercreep either.
Not only does that violate TOS (spreading misinformation), that can also come off as discriminatory, violating Rule 1. Stop, or there will be repercussions.

I‚Äôm not a douche you came at me by calling me an anti vaxxer and saying you don‚Äôt want us is making a simple question become personal. You attacked me personally I went after you sounds like you‚Äôre butthurt now because I hurt your feelings. Don‚Äôt go personal and then say the other guy is a douche lol. If you can‚Äôt answer the question then don‚Äôt I didn‚Äôt ask for a lay opinion I asked for an educated guess. Saying ‚Äú I hope so‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help anyone. I‚Äôm confident they probably don‚Äôt know you or they wouldn‚Äôt want you there. We have a name for you here it‚Äôs called a snowflake. Look it up if you don‚Äôt understand.

Ok, so this is really interesting! When you said this I thought to myself that this was in a later season--and it was! It was in season 8.

Sounds like you need to seriously take this moment to evaluate this relationship.  Would she leave you if you don't do this (or if you don't buy her another car) or is she threatening to?

Came here to say exactly this. This kid is 15 years old and is perfectly capable of telling right from wrong and knowing not to destroy others' property. Not only did he destroy someone else's personal property, but he stole her UNDERWEAR and used it to make a VIDEO, presumably to share with others/on the internet. Not only should the son specifically be on the hook for $500, OP should punish him on top of that. The money to replace what he damaged, the additional punishment for his malicious actions and emotional damage he caused.

Using PTO isn't docking your pay. If you are exempt, your paycheck will always be $1152 a week no matter what. 1 hour a week or 81 hours in a week, still $1152 PTO is an internal accounting function that isn't required by federal law (some states do require it but not federally), and doesn't have to be 'paid out' at the end of your employment if stipulated in your handbook and explained at hire.   Now, the question is what happens when you run out of PTO? Well the company can allow you to 'go negative'. But a lot of companies have limits to how far they'll let you go negative. If it goes too much, usually there's disciplinary action or  write ups, warnings, even termination. But note, all through that time, as long as you work 1 hour that week, your paycheck is still $1152, no matter what happening with PTO.   This is all contingent, of course, that your position is actually eligible for exempt status by the DoL definitions.
That would have been fun. Now i‚Äôm sad i didn‚Äôt think about that. Glad you liked it anyway. :)

Thanks for letting me know!

I will use it in very formal situations or with other advanced English degree holders, but outside of that, I don't worry about it unless I am mocking someone.

&gt; what kind of "proof" do you want?  Photographic, ideally.  &gt; color theory is a descriptive body of work and what it describes is that black (and white) tend to pair well with nearly any other color. this isn't new, niche or obscure information- this is something that designers of all kinds working in all mediums have been aware of for centuries.  I've heard of color theory. I've read a lot about it. I've seen a very small number of applications in fashion that actually made sense when moved from paper to practice.  &gt; black ... [is] used to create contrast  but it creates *intense* contrast. Grays are infinitely more versatile since they are tonally neutral *without* being an infinite void of despair from which no color can return.  &gt; even within fashion itself black has been widely acknowledged as "easy to match" for ages-  No, it hasn't, and you won't be able to provide me a source for that, because it's not true. I doubt you could even find a GQ article raving about black as "easy to match."  &gt; the only place where i've EVER seen this weird ass attitude towards the color is this subreddit.  Have you tried checking:  * Styleforum; or * any decent youtube channel; or * any other fucking fashion community?  &gt; If I had to attribute it to something it would be this subs roots in #menswear and traditional ivy prep, which are styles that favor earth tones and pastels over other colors.  Lol, this is so many different kinds of ridiculous. The sub predates #menswear, and has never been focused on classic menswear. Ivy prep was big here at different points in time...  But neither of these styles favors earth tones or pastels in any sense. Classic menswear is focused on navy and charcoal, with white and blue shirting, and *usually* reserves brown for shoes, where black is pretty much an equal competitor. Greens are very rare. Brown tailoring is classically disfavored and only gained an edge over black relatively recently, and even then, mostly only in casual tailoring. Black is still important in eveningwear, of course. Pastel shirting is sometimes acceptable.  Ivy prep still focuses on navy, with perhaps some gold hardware on your navy blazer. Black pennies and tassels are a big part of ivy prep. Grey is still big. Burgundies play a role. Browns come into play now and then. Greens are still not common. Shirting is mostly the same -- light blues and whites, with maybe some more pink in the oxfords, but also more of everything -- a red, orange, or yellow stripe oxford is absolutely fair game in ivy prep. So again, making it about earth tones or pastels means you either don't understand what ivy prep is, or don't understand what those color pallates even are.  &gt; if you want the science behind it- black isn't even a color really, it's the absence of light and you can turn any color into black by decreasing its value or subtractively combining it with enough other colors.  If you combine it with other colors, it's *not black*.  &gt; By definition it's neutral.  Tone. A neutral tone.  Olive and blue, despite being colors, are more neutral in practice, because they don't create intense, jarring contrast.

I suggest that you talk to your parents and tell them how you‚Äôre feeling.  Tell them you know how important college is to them and that you also are taking it seriously. Compliment their parenting.  Then  I encourage you to work out a no college zone or time.  With my family it was the dining room table ‚Äî my kids knew they could eat their Cheerios in the morning and have family dinners without my interrogating them.  It helped us all to have some barriers.  Some families only allow college talk one day or night a week or only in a certain room/space.  Other families make sure the car is a no college talk zone. Try to reach an agreement with your parents.

Ah, neat. The timing doesn't seem to match up, because I saw on NORAD's Twitter that they were doing daytime exercises yesterday. Maybe it's still related though!   I'm also pretty confident that it wasn't anything like a military jet, it was a much lighter aircraft.   Next time I see it I'll try and take a video.

i bought my 2004 wrangler X 4.0 5 speed for 8700$ in northern new jersey in 2018. it had 119000 miles. the guy was asking 10k though. since that jeep has the leak and could probably use tires, i would offer like $7000 maybe. hope this helps.

[Here](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/) is the full quote:  Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that, right? Coronavirus. They‚Äôre politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say, ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs President Trump doing?‚Äô They go, ‚ÄòOh, not good, not good.‚Äô They have no clue. They don‚Äôt have any clue. They can‚Äôt even count their votes in Iowa, they can‚Äôt even count. No they can‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt count their votes.  One of my people came up to me and said, ‚ÄòMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn‚Äôt work out too well. They couldn‚Äôt do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything, they tried it over and over, they‚Äôve been doing it since you got in. It‚Äôs all turning, they lost, it‚Äôs all turning. Think of it. Think of it. **And this is their new hoax.** But you know, we did something that‚Äôs been pretty amazing. We‚Äôre 15 people [cases of coronavirus infection] in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.

I get what you're saying, but I still don't get it. I'm not a huge fan of competitive gameplay, but how do I envy games like CoD and PUBG and Rocket League. I know most of those examples don't have a multiplayer story mode, but when you want to co-op or multiplayer in them, you just do. You don't have to complete arbitrary requirements. You don't have to jump through hoops. You just go.  I guess I'm just getting sick of games advertising exciting co-op only to find out that you can't co-op the main story, or one person has to complete the area or quest first then they can go back and co-op with the friend, or everyone has to watch the cutscene separately.  What I want is a game that can be co-op from start to end. MHW could have been that if they didn't have this stupid arbitrary solo assignments BS.

Pretty sure that Portugal controls the other half of the island, so Scotland ditched Europe to go and become Cuban in 3 provinces.

Hi: I implemented the system as shown above, with the "drip hose" above a black poly irrigation tubing (1/2" to 3/4"?) as the main line, with plugs branching off to individual drip lines and emitters at every pot.  It's powered with a fountain pump from Harbor Freight that has 264 gph and 5.5 ft of head ([https://www.harborfreight.com/plumbing/pumps/fountain-pumps/264-gph-submersible-pond-pump-63313.html](https://www.harborfreight.com/plumbing/pumps/fountain-pumps/264-gph-submersible-pond-pump-63313.html))  It would work beautifully for about 5-10 minutes, and the water flow will slow to a stop with intervention. I can reset everything by unhooking the main line from the pump and plugging it back in again, then it's back to being beautiful for 5-10 mins, etc.  I should mention that at the end of the main line I have an adjustable valve for purging any air in the system. I've tried operating with it opened all the way, and closed all the way, and different position in between, in an effort to adjust the flow rate to the drip branches but to no avail.  Is it some sort of airlock in the system that slowly degrade performance to nothing? The overall rise from the pump elevation to the bucket is about 2 - 2.5 ft, though the main line and the drip lines do rise and fall over the length due to kinks and physical constraints .  Would appreciate if anyone can help me understand why the dynamic nature of the water flow?  Thanks.
i really like the look of the secretlab TITAN and currently own one. Next gaming chair is probably gonna be a Noblechair Hero tho. I really like the executive/leather vibe. Doesn't look out of place in your office but also gives you everything you would want in a gaming chair I feel. Also one thing to add is that everyone has unique characteristics that would make recommending a chair very difficult without that information.

Having to stand at attention in schools for the national anthem, and the pledge of allegiance in American schools.  I imagine people in the future might view it as weirdly propagandistic to have as a daily event in schools starting from kingergarden and going onward for years.
This was no where near how HR should have handled this. They are to investigate the situation to see what is going on. Now asking about your JD is something we might do to see if you are operating outside your scope.   We only go to a boss if need be, but too many bosses want to act like they own their department and can make their own rules.
The Back to the Future trilogy is perfect for *everyone.* It's wholesome, funny, and just a *very good* series.

Women know men are insecure about size, evne if they're big. It's just hitting where it hurts. Bitchy thing to do, good riddance.   I suppose it's like you saying to a woman she's fat just out of spite to hurt her (which is a bitchy thing to do too). She's not, but _every_ woman will take that to heart, just like you guys do with size.

They are worth 30 BILLION low ball. They are milking the JW Hindenburg before it bursts into (somewhat) eternal flames. (Zech3:2) LDS was worth 30 billion in 2013. WTBTS is possibly double their networth. True, they have been skimming for years but there is still an easy 10 billion "nailed to the ground", but most is ported to the real "King North" bank at double those "brick and mortar" numbers. (Dan11:32a) If people think these GB-Pied-Piper guys are evil, then we may as well take it to the max as 333% PURE evil, total fakes, time to "go to heaven" soon (WT10/2019), evil. They have even laid out there "we gotta go to heaven" as the "the end" "exit plan" manifests shortly with the proper but misperceived "global events" which they will sell for as long as it lasts as "doomsday brothers! help us loot the now unneeded whoreld wide organization!".  From 2012 this thing has been set up like clockwork.  1. For example, 2012 "change in KH ownership policy" blah blah, by 2016 "let us mass liquidate the KHs now. 2. 2012 JW website as the "keep looking at the left hand" distraction for the 2014 JW "Broadcasting" TOTAL distraction just as all the real news was really going volcanic. 3. 2013 "obey the org as crazy as it sounds" "attack coming" hyped to today as "Gog", Russia is King North, "all the kings of the earth", the "Assyrian", "attack locusts", and on and on, all super-hyped in this same window of the op. 4. They have what is called a "self fulfilling prophecy" where "JWorg" is what "ends", not the world, that hype is just the cover for the planned liquidation.  CLEAR AS DAY, this is a hoax with a probably 50 BILLION DOLLAR total score. All that is needed is the proper global events, that is all.  When the "smoke" clears abandoned JW Lemmings at the cliff bottom will be 1. clueless, 2. a final prophecy fail GLOBAL LAUGHING STOCK, with a little eventual sympathy on the side. Those who end up in the "bunker safe house" WT funnel will also be looted too boot, and in prison or worse.

Years ago, back when I was a newb, my first ever Legendary was a Golden Edwin VanCleef. I held onto for a bit, but I had no interest in playing Rogue.

I still miss that Golden Edwin...  go figure

I‚Äôd say that most of the problems with the game isn‚Äôt really about the game mechanics at all but rather with the UX and optimizations.

Doesn't matter, you shouldn't be giving up your turn for hitting your opponent.
Anything with flight and a ranged attack will eventually whittle down a tarrasque. It's a punk with no flight. It'll just have to run away eventually then the level 1 wins and gets a shit load of xp.
It would be a big improvement in stiffness and ability of the forks to absorb big hits for sure, but there would be a major weight penalty, the Mach only weighs 3.5lb similar to a modern Reba or Fox 32, the Silver TK weighs over 5lbs (biggest reason is because of the steel stanchions). With a bigger wheel, tire and discs you'd be adding 3-4lb to the front end of the bike. I think the XCM32 are even heavier.  Also not sure how the damping would compare, the TK damping is basic and might not be better than that on a high end fork even from 20 years ago. The XCM damping is probably worse  One other thing I'd say, if you are looking to run a 27.5+ front wheel that will lift the front end of the bike as much or more than 40mm longer travel forks will, I would think the geometry would be thrown way off with both things combined. If you already have all the parts there's no harm trying it out for fun I guess though.
Teams like the Suns make me wish American sports had a promotion/relegation system similar to European soccer. A soccer team in England can‚Äôt be shit for 10 years and still play in the top league. And if a small team works hard they can claw their way to the top.

Well yeah, my comment was tongue-in-cheek. All states participate in that system, but there are [some states](https://taxfoundation.org/states-rely-most-federal-aid/) that undoubtedly more down to just use federal gibs than others. Idaho isn't the worst offender but it's not great.  &gt; Most, of not all, conservative states receive more money from the federal government, than what they pay in taxes.   That's different. What you're talking about is federal revenue vs federal spending per state (which is generally a lower ratio in rural states for a variety of reasons, and is negative in a majority of red and blue states), whereas I'm talking about the various [grants](https://www.grants.gov/) (of which there are currently 1225) given by the federal government to state governments that apply (and are eligible).

It doesn't matter, nobody needs to be an expert on IDE anymore.  Interestingly, that assumption illustrates that even ignoring the racial/political connotations, the master/slave terminology wasn't a great descriptor of the actual mechanism to begin with!

I've even seen a BIOS blatantly refer to the drives as C: and D:, despite the fact that you can have multiple partitions or non-DOS operating systems.

I never would have left a toxic relationship because it was so comfortable having someone to hold. But after we left university and went back home, I realized that I didn't like his company that much anyways. I found a therapist, because he said I was crazy, and she told me I probably experience narcissistic abuse and gaslighting. I'm so glad COVID got me out of that situation. Being home gave me strength to find myself and grow stronger in peace.

FWIW, I wouldn't do in home pods for anyone but family, for legal reasons.   Imagine what happens when you start opening your home for other kids, even if they're friends of your kid: if they hurt themselves in your care, it opens you to legal liability for any injury.   If they were just visiting for a playdate, then your homeowners' insurance may very well pay for the medical bills out of a plethora of accidental coverages for guests and/or dwellers in the home.   But if they can prove you're running what amounts to a school out of your home? Then your homeowners' insurance won't pay for the bills, leaving the only recourse for the other parents to sue the pants off of you.   I mean, we almost agreed to a pod back in March with one of my daughter's classmates, but the parents had second thoughts for that very reason, and the more we thought about it, my spouse and I were like "yeeesh, their decision to go back on it kinda dodged a legal bullet for us too.

&gt;Since the lows of 2018, the ratio has gone up by ~10%. so yes, it has gone up.  12% If we look at the end of 2018 low (0.02348) and current ratio (0.02651). But on June 26 of 2020 (this year) the rate was 0.0231, even lower then the 2018 low.   This is just Cherry picking datapoints, wouldn't you agree? I can see with my own eyes the ratio is closer to 0.023 (prior ATL from 2018) then it is to 1.0 (starting point). I can see multiple times the ratio got higher and closer to 0.067 first, then declined back down to 0.025) and again went up to 0.048 (and declined back to 0.023) in the timeframe between those two data points you picked.  Instead, try this:  Using a 100 or 200 day moving average shows the declining ratio trend. It smooths out all the noise and shows the trend.  &gt;- Price manipulation by Tether, who has failed to show proof of their funds for more than 2 years  Tether is used for more then just bitcoin. It is not ONLY used for exchanging into bitcoin.   If you prefer to ignore tether, look at coinbase, which is KYC and forces actual dollars to become bitcoin or bitcoin cash or whatever altcoins they offer.   &gt;- Market manipulation by exchanges to try and keep Bitcoin #1  This. How to reason against a conspiracy theory? I really can't just convince you otherwise if you want to believe in that. I really doubt the whole market is manipulated by independently operated exchanges located in various jurisdictions, all competing for a slice of the crypto market share.   Does that sound reasonable and logical or does it sound more like a conspiracy theory?  So they all decided that they would do this btc/bch collusion thing because they hate bch? yes? .. Then the only reasonable response option is **‚ÄúThat which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence"**   What if it isn't a conspiracy. What if individual people, chasing after their own best interests, the sum of which has collectively resulted in the price actions we have seen over the past few years?  &gt;- Misinformation spread about Bitcoin Cash that harms its overall perception by those in and outside of the crypto community  One bullet point above is misinformation, presented as a supporting fact.  Bitcoin had misinformation about it spread by lots of people, not just a rival coin group. By governments, by banks, by people and yet it has survived and thrived.

If this comment gets 'disappeared', then we know without a doubt what these mods are like. I'm keeping my eye on this.
Everyone here under estimates the human ability to adapt to seemingly horrible conditions. We can build a routine out of anything, find joy in anything. Everyone always says life in prison is worse than death, but I haven't seen people getting life kill themselves at any astonishing rate.  No they fall into social groups in prison, change expectations of their life, control the things they can. There's people who seemingly want to go back inside. If prison was the horror it seems like to us not incarcerated, there'd be a lot less fucking recidivism.   Think about the human condition, and the history of our evolution. We're talking hundreds of thousands of years of having little to no freedom, and well zero if you're a woman, but suddenly, only bring able to watch television for four hours a day is gonna break us?   The death penalty should be reserved for cases where there's no question of guilt. An absolute avalanche of irrefutable evidence. And everybody on death row should die within twelve months of their conviction. If there's any more doubt or confusion than that they shouldn't be there. But there's thousands of people on death row we are absolutely certain committed heinous acts against their victims and society, and can never be rehabilitated, that we seem to want to keep alive for forty years before we finally give them the needle in the middle of night. And then we say it costs more to put them to death, than keep them alive.

&gt; The Postal Service wasn't a problem until Republicans forced them to **pay out pensions in advance**.  Geeze, can't even get the talking points right.  You're referring to the PAEA, which required the USPS to fund its unfunded retiree health benefits.  It didn't have anything to do with pensions, and nothing was "paid out in advance".  It had to do with funding what would have been nearly $80 billion in RHB liabilities by 2007 had the bill not passed.  As for them being a-ok without the bill, the USPS has over $100 billion in unfunded liabilities after 2001.  The PAEA wasn't enacted until 2006.  Of the RHBF payments they made, about $12 billion of which was done with loans from the federal government, one payment was reduced by $4 billion from $5.5 billion to $1.5 billion, and the 2011 payment was deferred to 2012, which they didn't make, and haven't made a payment since.  They've been paying out their retirement health benefit obligations straight from the fund, which will be completely depleted in less than ten years.  They lost nearly $9 billion this year without those large payments, which were only set to run until 2017, and only put $900 million into their RHB fund.  The rest was operating losses and annual benefit expenses.   But yeah, it was the PAEA that caused all their problems.  And it was *totally* the Republicans who passed the bill, while it was staunchly opposed by the NALC, the USPS, and the Democrats in congress, right?

I am an educated person and I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd fall into one or become so easily trapped. I‚Äôve gotten away from it now and it honestly feels like I escaped from a cult.

Got them from coco, they were REALLY pink when I got them (I‚Äôd probably go with kick who or mango or whatever for LJR as it seems like they‚Äôve been getting non pink tongues unions lately).   This is after the white sharpie oil pen fix, applied a few layers. In most lightings it looks like white, some lightings it looks cream, it would probably look a lot better with some wear. Only small issues I have is that because it‚Äôs oil paint, it changed the texture a bit and doesn‚Äôt have the slight reflective ness of the original texture, and the previously white stitching is paint coloured white but no ones gunna see that on feet.  Initially they were slightly stiff because of the paint, but just bending and flexing it/ wearing them they‚Äôre as flexible as before the fix. Texture wise they‚Äôre everso slightly rougher.

Exactly! Police should always go into a situation assuming that people aren‚Äôt going to be 100% compliant. They should deescalate the situation and if the citizen won‚Äôt comply, subdue the person non lethally. I have an autistic brother, and when he gets agitated he doesn‚Äôt comply, but we don‚Äôt blow his brains out, we just restrain him and move him to a quiet area until he calms down.

please take a dep breath. Do not commit suicide. Please call for help. It sounds like your friendship troubles stem from your depression, anxiety and bi-polar and some immaturity. Please make your own mental health your top priority. Make sure you see a doctor, your meds are right, anything you can do with that. Then make  sure you have more than one friend to rely on.  Hang out with someone else.

Says he wasn't even diagnosed officially with depression until after the charges,... Even still though, how does that mitigate this at all? It's not as if it made him suddenly attracted to children. Getting into child porn is not "dabbling in risky behavior". Risky behavior from PTSD is more like buying drugs, stealing, cheating, etc.  This shit makes no sense to me , That evilness was already there obviously. Oh my God I just can't.... How that judge could say any of that with dignity and a straight face in front of a whole court..... I don't know who said it or if I'm quoting correctly, but its fitting for this so here :.

Yeah. No.  I'm saying going beyond the mandatory community service required by the league. It's cool that you want to bash him because of his faith. I prefer to look at his character.   https://www.nba.com/magic/isaac-donates-community-award-grant-money-project-life-20191031  "This contribution to Project Life by the 22-year-old is just the latest of many since he became an advocate for them and a partner of theirs a year and a half ago. This past summer, in fact, Isaac joined other Project Life-ers in Trinidad, where they held their Global Food Festival to celebrate culture, heritage, diversity and unification while assisting those in need with food, clothes, children‚Äôs toys and other supplies."  https://www.wesh.com/article/magics-isaac-helps-feed-orlando/32191415  His service isn't something that just started recently. It's something he has been doing. Not to say that other player participate in similar avenues. But for a 22 year old compared to the majority of the league. Yes I am very confident he does a lot more for his community than the average player.

As a Latino, I agree.
Fluid elements of sexuality extend so far beyond sexual orientation! Different ways to have sex and sexual play may start turning you on, stop turning you on, or just change how they make you feel. We may seek different kinds of sex at different points in life, or enjoy different roles with sexual partners in different phases. All of this is part of our sexuality, and all of it changes over time.

Saw so many of these idiots while working in the court and law enforcement systems. They only know violence and intimidation.   The way these guys, and some of the gals, stop this behavior is by doing 20 to 30 years and actually "aging out" of violent behavior. In other words, they grow up about age 50, look around and realize there is more to life than walking the yard.  Sometimes they stay out, and sometimes they dont.

For my older cousins I can never face or confront them about it. One is married and with a kid the other two are too ingorant to have a serious talk with. I don't socialize with them that much.

Katie Joy is nuts. I am no Duggar fan but most of the time KJ doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about.
I did. Watching professional porn had me convinced that my cock was too small. It was not the size of Ron Jeremy so I assumed that I was too small. It wasn‚Äôt until I started sleeping with experienced women that I learned that I had a pretty big dick! It wasn‚Äôt until a woman experienced with deep-throating who couldn‚Äôt take me into her throat that I actually realized that I was quite thick.   I do recommend that every guy learn how to make their partner cum hard with their hands and mouth. Doesn‚Äôt matter how big you are, you really should focus on providing pleasure vs taking pleasure from your partner.

It's more fun many times to challenge yourself if you're playing for enjoyment, whether with new tactics or new equipment, rather than stick to an established meta where the game is "solved."  Plus, having to adapt to non-optimal circumstances is a good way to build your skills. It's often less satisfying to cream someone with the ideal weapon than to make it happen though quick thinking or patience.

I finally found this mention.  Early NC was great, but his skits with those other two are/were cringy garbage. And they became a bigger and bigger part of his reviews. He overestimated his comedic talent so much that he made a whole feature-length movie.   Also... I got real tired of his "I'll shoot anything I don't like" sophomoric humor.  I also don't know what the drama with Lindsay Ellis was about, but I assume that she's in the right about it.

I have been visiting Las Vegas for the last few weeks, and have some good off the strip food recommendations!  If you like Bahn Mi check out Co Anh Vietnamese. It‚Äôs to go only.  In the same shopping center of Co Anh is Urban Crawfish Station! You can dine in, but I suggest making a reservation, it‚Äôs busy and they‚Äôre spacing out tables for social distancing.  If you like bbq go to Rollin‚Äô Smoke BBQ. They have dine in.   For Italian, go to Amano, it‚Äôs a little off the beaten path but worth it! It has dine in, but like Urban Crawfish Station they‚Äôre enforcing social distancing, so seating is limited, make a reservation. The rosemary lemonade is bomb!   Hope this helps!

Maybe I missed her saying otherwise, but if it‚Äôs a newer marriage I disagree. With children who are minors? Absolutely you both become responsible. But adult children? I don‚Äôt think so. Unless it‚Äôs actual economic hard time, saving them from homelessness kinda deal, but in this case it‚Äôs paying for a wedding or study abroad.
Your boyfriend sounds like a well-cultivated individual.   Why would people expect their coworkers to be friendly? I certainly do not.   Why would an unfriendly coworker be uncooperative? One can be both unfriendly and cooperative at the same time.   Why does this not make for a healthy work dynamic? Work can get done regardless of work dynamic.   Why would she dislike me for disliking her when that is not the case? I am indifferent towards her the same way I am indifferent towards the rest of my coworkers. Sounds to me like she is oversensitive.
I genuinely thought Scream 4 was a great addition to the series and kind of fairly reasonable escalation of the series in terms of plot. I'd be curious and cautiously optimistic to see how they continue it from there.  My only thought would be making Kirby (Hayden Panettiere's character) a "survivor" turned "killer" after we don't really know what happened to her after being stabbed outside by the pool. Perhaps she managed to crawl away and find someone to save her then holds a grudge with Sydney for "abandoning" her and never trying to find her after the fact.

So, bodies and objects emit energy based on their temperature. Humans, because of "our" temperature (35¬∞C),  we emit energy in the form of "waves" within the infrared range. Unfortunately, humans cannot see in the infrared range, our naked eye only "see" range from blue to red. However, we have created little computers that can actually "see" this infrared range. As such, this little computers "see" humans as different tones of "red" depending on the temperature. Interestingly enough, the little machines cannot make mistakes as our eyes, and because of that no matter what little machine is used in the hand pistol thermometer, they can accurately measure our temperature.

Yeah I mean everyone latches on to different things. I was really lukewarm at first but it keeps burrowing in on further listens. Desert Rambler is this album‚Äôs Stars, and I am slowly sinking in. But if it‚Äôs not gelling, it‚Äôs not gelling. Even a single song would be worth the money I have thrown down on vinyl/shirt/bandcamp
There‚Äôs bulk but it‚Äôs kind of the place where restaurant people go when their line of credit is bad. Some prices are downright predatory. The mesquite charcoal is awesome, and the plastic and tin foil are good, but not everything is fairly priced.
That's nice but it's not the system we have.
As if the rest of us don‚Äôt want a gd pod. I actually don‚Äôt know exactly what the is but I‚Äôm positive I want one..
Same I feel youuu and I think your decision to refrain from making extra comments is definitely justified. Maybe when as time progresses and you feel more comfortable you can talk more but that shouldn‚Äôt be a priority imo
Integrated wifi would be nice but I do have a USB wifi dongle ready. Use case is just email and web browsing. Wanting to go for 6 cores cos of future proof. Most likely won‚Äôt upgrade again in 5-7 years.   Basically I‚Äôm looking for a decent laptop spec in a desktop format if that makes sense.
Sounds like if Trump started his own religious cult.
I'm fucking trying man. But fuck me.... I can barely talk to people and they're like "go out and party, be a teenager'

Khabib has lost 0 of his like 28 fights
I‚Äôve gotten muted twice in the past couple weeks, but it‚Äôs pretty justified since I tend to cuss out all the scrubs that helped lose us the game  Edit: I am one of those scrubs that helped lose us the game sometimes

Can I get some free downvoted please
I hate how he even has fans. He‚Äôs an abusive stalker. His 15 mins are long up
Link me, baby!
What I'd do is put diplodocus in first. It can't be killed by pele so it will dino swap into guanlong. Then get as many reserves as possible with diplodocus and put limnoscelis. Kill guanlong and then use the rest of your moves for reserves to sacrifice limno. then put in argentino or triceratops to kill diplo and then you'll have the advantage over pelecanipteryx. Sometimes you don't need great creatures to win. I understand you're relatively new to the game so you don't know the best fighting tactics yet.
100% . I don't know why teens like to be edgy about death lol
My uncle is a huge lions fan I'm a jags fan. We have been joking about how  This is our year and we are going to the superbowl against each other because God hates our teams. These are our predictions   No one will get to go to the game because of covid so we can't experience it in person. It will be a boring defensive battle for the first quarter till the feed cuts out and we can no longer watch then it will become the highest scoring NFL game ever in a wild offensive shoot out.  The local files will all be corrupted giving no actual record of it being a great game depriving us of its glory.  Legend of the footage will pop up occasionally giving us hope of seeing it but will ultimately always be a rick roll
Nothing beats having the physical copy in your hands.
Proposed to my girlfriend of 5 years at Cannon Beach, Oregon.
I missed that it was three years although the math is confusing. I got confused in the digression about your sexual assault more recently and missing that the relationship is open as well.  Seeing other people is a great reason for the condoms, especially if he has his own partners as well.  Do you live with him? I've been having sex outside my marriage with the same woman-who-is-not-my-wife for six years on a calendar, but I'm not sure it's really right to call that a "six year relationship". For one thing, I was married to my wife all that time. For another thing we would sometimes have multi-month gaps between seeing each other.
Awwwwwwww
Ditto
Trust me I played the game for months like you did thinking the online was dead. I did port forwarding three days ago I barely get a break between games now even in ranked which was one game per hour before.
Can I come?

Play some ILoveMakonnen
Same. Been much more productive since.
Alsnog is een repost
Yup, and that girl started menstruating at 3 years old, I believe
This is why I trust lions and would never trust a shady, sneaky tiger!
its because they dont want children.  they want babies they can play dress up with.  Once that baby becomes a child and has their own thoughts and personalities that dont mimic the parent. the parent stops caring.  i see this shit wayyyyyyy too much :/  &amp;#x200B;  same thing as people wanting puppies. then once they grow up they dont care anymore.
Actually, from the New York Times.
Get single-fold bias tape; it‚Äôs wider. Place the ‚Äúflaps‚Äù so they are against the shirt   Here‚Äôs a lighter gray  https://www.amazon.com/Wright-Products-117-200-515-Wrights-Single/dp/B000XZY8XM
Then get on an LP program, you got a decent amount of linear gains left to make. I‚Äôd say GZCLP, just focus on heavy compound lifts, accessories to train your weak points, and isolation to hammer weak muscles/ones you want to grow
We know youve been wayching the PLL
Now THIS is news!
I've migrated from text files -&gt; Google drive -&gt; notion -&gt; back to text files with obsidian. I do love notion, but I think markdown files are the way to go. I want to check out Org-Roam because of all the rave things I hear about it. Has a learning curve though
yellow, or apple green
Yes.
First link, the kit contains the HomeBase 2. On the back the HomeBase 2 has a USB port that's supposed to be enabled in the future for storage of recordings. Currently, the HB2 records internally to 16GB eMMC.  Second link, the kit contains the HomeBase (1). It has a microSD card slot, though I don't know if it records to that right now. I'd assume it does.  I have the HomeBase 2 and Cam2 kit with 2 cameras. Overall, very nice.
My San Antonio Missions 5 oz is my wife's favorite piece out of all we have. They're pretty nifty.
If you got your buddy cop action adventure, I would be the one complaining about shitty writing.  We both wanted very different things out of part 2, it was never going to work for both of us.
