[SHOGUN OF STEEL](http://www.comicvine.com/jla-shogun-of-steel-1-shogun-of-steel/4000-218221/)
I grew up a daddy's girl and have stuck by my dad's side through the ups and downs of his alcoholism... Unfortunately 3 days before the wedding after being sober for 6 months he decided to have a drink.. Went on a bender and after showing up unshowered with stains on his shirt was escorted out of my rehearsal dinner belligerent and sobbing. He tried to jump out of the car 3 times on the way home and ended up in the icu the day of my wedding. It is the biggest heartache of my life. I walked down the aisle alone. Tear stained cheeks to my amazing husband who met me halfway down the aisle and from that moment on I knew I would never have to walk alone again.

Do somebody know is there any chance to transfer ActiveMining shares out of the bitfunder?  I found this link https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=297503.msg3325553#msg3325553, but I couldn't find the final solution...
Meh...on the scale of ruling titles, that's probably a puppet dictator. Not bad, but you've got a ways to go. 
No problem. The best way to create a solid world structure is to constantly test it for weak points. Ask yourself as many questions about your world as possible, and don't pull any punches. You may find everything needs changes, or only a few things need changed
i see youve never been bullied in your life
Thanks for ruining something special you doofus.
amen to that
Can you help me please?

Red fang has the best videos. They deserve to be bigger. 
Not to mention some great leaders (Alexander the Great, Hadrian, Ludwig II of Bavaria, who probably contributed more to arts than politics come to think of it). Glad to see Tchaikovsky mentioned, he is my favourite composer. It raises an interesting debate point as well in Russia. Following the anti-homosexual legislation which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality, one wonders how to approach Tchaikovsky, considering that he is Russia's most well known composer.

well it used to be quite liberal for the south, then all the republicans got elected last time, which has made it take quite a turn. Now NC continuously makes national headlines for stupid political moves.   Drive an hour or two outside of it though, and it's pretty much what you were thinking. Not as bad as that Duck Dynasty thing that is all the rage
Also at restaurants, it's so annoying when parents let their kids make ridiculous messes on the floor.  As a former server, I can confirm that it's a bitch to have to get up slobbery strands of chicken from carpet with a broom.

Ok. I'll be on soon.
Elan is a douchebag, why antagonize that woman? Clearly she is upset about something she cares a lot about.
The Walking Dead?
I've never understood why this is always portrayed as some huge women's issue pivotal moment. Clearly it is a mental health issue; this dude was sick and needed help. No one agrees with what he did, no one stood by and cheered him on, no one told him to do this. He was just a disturbed gunman like all the others we've seen over the years and was just as much a victim as the women he shot. He didn't just get up one day and go "ya know I bet people would be stoked if I shot a bunch of women studying engineering" he was anguished and tortured and got to a point so low and desperate he saw the only solution to his problems as killing a bunch of female engineering students and then shooting himself in the head. If you ask me it is the product of bad attitudes toward men, not toward women. Maybe if he had been able to ask for help, to feel like his pain could be helped with support from others instead of having to be a hero and stand up as a warrior he and his victims would all be alive and happy today.
There are two reason that I can think of:  1) Sport clubs have a personality.  Club have certain characteristics that make them unique.  Manchester United, for example, has a real comeback/never give up attitude.  This was clearly demonstrated when they had to rebuild their team in the 1950's after the Munich air crash, and when they scored two goals in the last 3 minutes to win the EUFA cup in 1999.  People are attracted to clubs that have an attitude that they admire.  2) Some people support certain clubs because of the players they have.  If someone has a favourite player, there is a good chance that they will support their team as well.
We will wait
&gt; Yes those who are not Jewish and are critical of Israel are all racists.  Nice [strawman](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man). He never said that all non-Jews who criticize Israel are racist.  &gt; The same way all those who were critical of apartheid in South Africa were just all anti-Dutch racists.  That's a false equivalency. The circumstances of the Bedouin are nothing like the plight of blacks living under apartheid. 
No, they are all rip offs

&gt;Why squabble about insignificant differences of opinion that truly change nothing?  Because the top comment in this thread brought the subject up.

1) The Vancouver aquarium  2) Science world (get blinded! by science!) 3) If you find yourself with a sunny day, walk around the Sea Wall 4) Eat at Joe Forte's patio if it's nice out (get the oysters), or Hawksworth if it's rainy (I'd do both, really) 5) Take a brewery tour (these are good ones: http://vancouverbrewerytours.com) 6) The Bloedel Floral Conservatory is a pretty neato place; they've got birds and fish and stuff in an indoor garden  If you have the budget, I'd do food tourism - we've got great restaurants throughout the city, offering a variance of culinary styles.  I agree with previous Redditors; La Tacqueria is great, and so is the Twisted Fork, if you're not looking for fine dining. I also agree with the recommend of Brewery Creek on Main Street; I live in that neighbourhood, and stand by their extensive selection of beers.  If you're looking for a night out, Celebrities on Davie Street is a pretty safe bet for a good time. Be warned, though - boozing in Vancouver isn't cheap.  Don't go to Tofino/anywhere on Vancouver unless you're going to have a near guarantee of sunny weather, which is pretty hard to come by. It'll be a waste of time if the weather is crap, and you'll probably have a bad time.  Have a good time here! @victoria_potter

&gt;I don't think it is fair to compare any type of disorders  That's what I meant to get at in my edit. Sorry if it didn't come off too clearly. I'm also not trying to say that it's any worse then Schiz. or Depression, I wouldn't with any of those disorders on my worst enemy. I was trying to say that you shouldn't be comparing any mental disorders, because they are all in different leagues.   ADD is really interesting, in that all of the people i've met who have ADD experience it differently. I found that for me, I would start thinking of something and slowly fade away from the Lecture going on, then without realizing it, then come back to the Lecture and then realize that I completely got distracted, and Didn't hear anything.  When I was being driven to my Doctors for a Diagnosis, I actually got distracted and forgot what I was talking to my mom about. When i got into the Doctors, I actually got distracted by my thoughts DURING the diagnosis, and came back to them asking me a question that I blocked out.  I love your analogy of it being like a Thick Fog, and how it isn't like "Oh look, a squirrel!", because I never got distracted by an object, but I got distracted by my thoughts. 
You're clearly not qualified to support the London Arsenal. Just like how the first team is made up of only the most skilled players, so the support too is made up of only the most skilled spectators.

How is EoCscape a derogatory nickname? If any reference to EoC is derogatory to you, maybe you shouldn't be playing it in the first place. It is a defining factor of the game, more than 50% of it, so I don't see why you have a problem.  Potatoscape on the other hand  **is** a derogatory nickname, as it is an obvious jab at the graphics, and potatoes in the game play a very small role.  tl;dr go fuck yourself you troll

I was born via C-section because after inducing four times over three weeks I still wasn't coming... My mother went ahead and had my brother and sister the same way.

That's not true, Mango consistently beats Hbox. I think Hugs describes it well in the doc. Hbox forces his opponent to play efficiently and carefully if they want to win. Mango generally prefers balls-to-the-wall aggression, and so he's frustrated having to adapt to beat Hbox.  From a viewer's perspective I think Mango doesn't like Hbox's playstyle for purely aesthetic reasons.

It (would be) super embarrassing, but it would be inappropriate to blow up the mountainside in an attempt to erase that part of our history.  It happened, and we should own that even if that's not who we are in the present.  If looking at that mountainside makes us feel embarrassed then it will serve as a reminder to not do that again.  Edit: The founder of the KKK is not in the Stone Mountain carving.  It's Confederate President Davis and two Confederate generals.

Even though my Dad didn't make it, I really appreciate what you guys do and just how many people you have saved. Thanks for being such an awesome person.

You sound like a very angry person. It must be because of your pessimistic attitude. FaceBook killed MySpace, reddit killed digg. There's StartPage and Duck Duck Go and Bing, that compete with Google. None of them were sued for patent infringement. There's DailyMotion and Vimeo and LiveLeak. They're still going strong for the markets they serve. New websites spring up every day, and so the web evolves. I was just reading about a new website called "Syme" which will be a fully encrypted social media site for users who are sick of FaceBook and Google's intrusiveness.  With your attitude a day will come when you're accessing Google owned websites on a Google owned Browser via a Google owned fiber network. And if Google makes a mistake with your account you'll lose everything with no way to even let them know there's a problem. I don't want that kind of internet and I think others are realizing the same thing. People are rightly feeling claustrophobic and they want out.

Fuck, for real? I have two friends that donated their long braids to Locks of Love. Learning this was crushing.  edit: Found this on wikipedia:  &gt;Locks of Love has received criticism for its practice of selling donated hair, rather than using it in wigs as the donors expect. According to the Locks of Love website, some unusable hair (bleached, highlighted, gray, or shorter than 10") is sold to offset the cost of manufacture of custom-made wigs.  &gt;According to its tax returns, Locks of Love made $1.9 million from hair sales from 2001 to 2006, and took in another $3.4 million in donations. Besides paying for wigs, the money goes to overhead and other costs, including grants for alopecia research. Locks of Love sends the best of the hair it receives to a wig manufacturer, Taylormade Hair Replacement in Millbrae, California, which sorts the selection still further, rejecting up to half.

Is this someone else's script that hasn't been filmed or a script that has been made into a movie?   If it really is just for personal use and practice then I don't see why you would be worried about it. You can't really get in trouble for just showing it to your friends and family. If the copyright holder somehow found out you did this, which they shouldn't if you didn't post it online or at public events, etc. it really isn't going to be an issue. They can't really tell you to cease and desist if you aren't publishing the work anywhere.  Yes, you can film whatever (legal) things you want. You won't get into in trouble if this is for personal use or for telling people you made these films for personal use.   The only reason that people use Fair Use etc. (which this isn't) is because they want to distribute it in some form.   You can't really put it in your reel or portfolio though, there are places to collaborate with aspiring writers who will give you their short scripts for free. You are better off making something you can really call your own, even if the first couple don't turn out.

I think you'll find that the overpricing of American healthcare predates the mandate. (Mandate kicks in next year, and [here](http://i.imgur.com/poDn0uQ.jpg)'s a great chart of how we're doing vs. the rest of the world.)  Meanwhile, I'm reasonably happy with my Romneycare up here in MA. Technical glitches in first month or two of the federal website notwithstanding, you'll likely find that the ACA will reduce the number of uninsured by a very significant number in the first few years.   Since the GOP wouldn't listen to the left's call for single-payer (or single-provider), we may have to wait a generation before we can bend the cost curve back. (Maybe start with bargaining with industry over Medicare D benefits?)
I heard on the Fallout Wiki that the trademark for Fallout 4 has been removed. Is there any substance to this?

It looks to me that your background (or the stroke) is filled with bitmap color, and is rasterized, when laid over/under a vector graphic this will occur sometimes.   could also be differing color modes, change both to RGB

Thank you, I am glad you are one of the good parents. I honestly have to say, that on average the autistic and disabled children I have come across have been much friendlier, more polite, and well behave than the average suburban child.   There have been a few that had guardians/check collectors, who could care less about the kid, and those kids would act out. Sad to see it.
Sweet! Thanks.
Why would your mother protest that! It's got to be the safest branch by far...

Courts have ruled time and time again that religious beliefs are not grounds for discriminating against people.  The cab may be privately owned, but it a publicly accessible entity, like a store, and as such, the law prohibits discrimination. Period.
Of course, if it were as simple as not letting it "get to you", then there wouldn't be a problem. Obviously, he doesn't want the jokes to get to him, but they do. So how does one become less offended by seemingly harsh jokes? Barring that, I suppose he could communicate to his friends how they're making him feel, but I feel that this sort of crowd wouldn't respond well to that. If that fails, there's really no reason for him to keep hanging around with people that make him feel bad...

I have one question, if you don't know what you need, then why are you starting the business?   Shouldn't you know this before you start a business or are you planning on learning with your customers pc's? 
They were both seen as "odd". Hobbits don't go on adventures. And they definitely don't make friends with dwarves and wizards. Bilbo and Frodo were definitely "legends" but being a legend in the Shire is not a very good thing.

I just want to add one thing. Along with no sharp objects, studded belts are usually confiscated and not allowed in venues. Not sure how popular those are anymore though.
That interview was done a full year ago.  I don't think Chris anticipated they would have the funding they do now.  Information has changed over the past year.  It may have been true at that point, but its certainly not the case now.

It's Riots rules, however not their equipment or setup. The players aren't in a studio for example. I understand that Quantic should've been DQ'd, rules are rules. Just seems silly that it should happen in the first place for a tournament that can have some much money on the line if future. 12k for players (around 80/100k to organisations).

Similar to detecting_nuttiness's comment, I would ask your father whether he's at all concerned that his attempt to shield you from Christianity will have the opposite effect that he's intending.  Maybe you can also ask him if he's more comfortable with you attending another denomination.  (I'm unclear as to whether there's something about this particular church and youth group that concerns him.)

I like Blink, but I agree with you, it's not a good place to start if you're new to the series. I think Utopia might be a bit too long though, as that story is spread across three episodes.  I would also add The Girl in the Fireplace.
Moral here is how you treat other people. It's nothing to do with believing in God or believing your morality is divinely ordained or in any external way "correct".
Ah, I think you're missing the vegans point.   &gt; but when you don't eat meat because someone somewhere is abusing animals just sounds stupid to me.  See, it's not just *someone, somewhere* who is doing this. The meat industry and lobby is *massive*. And of course there are vegans who oppose the idea of generally killing animals, but I don't think that's the majority. Most of them think that you could kill animals (as in hunt them), but what the gigantic meat industry does is wrong. And it's not just someone somewhere, literally *every* meat product you can buy in a regular super market is produced by the meat industry that acts immoral towards animals.  I am not vegan and I don't want to tell you what to eat or anything, but their argument for not eating meat is not that "somewhere someone is abusing animals". They do have a legitimate point, whether you agree with their way of living or not.

I am pro, rebuilding ancient monuments. The whole point in them was to look amazing in the city, they are called ruins for a reason.  While it is impressive the buildings have lasted so long that is all they are good for, being impressive signs of longevity. You cannot appreciate their majesty unless they are rebuilt to their original standards.  For example the colosseum, it's just a ruin. It would be far more interesting, and attract a lot more people if it where rebuilt properly. Hell you could even use it for it's intended purpose (maybe less killing Christians though, it's frowned upon).

Wow! You sound actually really cool haha!  Truth is, sometimes I dress up and put makeup on. Though I mostly wear t-shirts and cargo shorts, which sometimes leads people to believe that I instead prefer vagina. Anyway, my parents are both strictly Catholic and extremely conservative, so I guess we're on the other end of the spectrum. If I told my parents that I was a lesbian, my dad would probably ignore the fact that I exist and my mom would be welcoming. Your mother would be more accepting, so I kinda wish I had your family lol.

Well...I got passed over for Bad Horse's Villain of the Year award...again.  ...  I'm not bitter. I'm really not. It's been a good year for...not being...good. I've finally been accepted to the Evil League of Evil...my arch-nemesis is still in counseling after the beating I gave him. Moist is now the treasurer of the Henchmen Union...they figured no one could grease his palms if they were perpetually damp.   Of course, the year wasn't without sacrifice.  ...  ...  These contests...they're nothing but politics, you know, all breaking hands and kicking babies. Whose famine-bomb did you help fund? Whose nemesis did you team up to destroy?   The entire system of villainy is corrupt! But...not the good kind of corrupt. It's corruption...within corruption. Meta-corruption. The worst kind. Yeah.  And I mean, this contest, it's not just about the money. Well, it's a *little* about the money. It's a lot about the money. But it's also about recognition, about the street cred, all the fame and acknowledgement that comes with Bad Horse's Bridle of Approval.  Of course, there's also the rumor...just a rumor, of course...that the Villain of the Year is also awarded a small sample of Endless Bob's fabled Elixir of Immortality. Just a rumor, of course. But if it were true, just imagine the power that would bring. A supervillain could live forever, or even, perhaps, bring back the dead...  ...  ...  Well, let's uh, let's check some e-mails. Here's one from...Th3Pen1sMightierThanTh3Hamm3r...looks like we've got a big fan of replacing letters with numbers.  It reads, "Hello Bil--" *cough*...um, sorry, still choking on the Wonderflonium fumes down here. *cough* It reads, "Hello Doctor. I herd u jest got berned by the Eval Leegg of Eval." Ah, yes, I see the news of my snubbing has already begun to spread. "I no weve had r differinses in the past, but if u r looking 4 revinj, i may hafe a propasishun 4 u..."  ...  ...  Uh...sorry, internet audience, I...sort of trailed off there. I'm sure I'll edit that out in post. Anyway, it looks like I may have a way to overthrow this contest's status quo. Because the status...you know.

I occasionally put on an accent just in general conversation, depending on the context. E.g., French for creepy flirting, Russian for plotting murder, Cockney or Bogan Australian for when I'm feeling trashy, or a generic southern American (USA) accent for when someone's being an idiot, or I'm joking about racism, sexism, or any other isms.  I don't ever go out of my way to deliver a specific joke or character, though. It just feels awkward and if I concentrate too much on an accent it falls to shit.  I do a fair bit of improv comedy, I'm just in love with on the spot humour and wit.

No there are so many poor because people like you argue against their own interests when the rich people tell them to. There are so any poor because the rich pay less and less taxes each year despite having a massive majority of the wealth. There are so many poor because your system is terrible and people can't even get medical treatment without going bankrupt.  There's a difference between having money and politically catering to the rich in exchange for campaign donations.  "Stop repeating the bullshit you've been programmed with and look at an occasional fact and you won't sound so stupid." That's pretty rich considering you're basically a fox news talking point.  Both Reagan and Obama are right wingers, but Reagan's policies were technically more left leaning. Do you even know about his policies, or are you just repeating what you've been told?

My senior year, I needed 5 classes to have enough credits to graduate, where the typical days schedule had 6. My counselor refused to give me a 5 class schedule and forced me into taking the 6th. I didn't show up to the 6th class the entire semester. I was called into her office for something unrelated like 2 weeks from graduation so I guess she pulled up my info. After I left the office, I was called back in, she had seen that I never attended the 6th class and promised to do everything in her power to make sure I didn't graduate. Nothing ever developed after that though, I just avoided her for 2 weeks.

There surely is hope in pursuing a scientific career. However, some scientific disciplines are more...profitable than others. Engineering is by far the most profitable, followed by chemistry and biology. Some disciplines are inherently geared more towards academia, which historically doesn't pay a whole bunch. Regardless, whatever job you get will probably, hopefully, pay the bills, but you may not see much wealth. We scientists usually aren't in it for the money, as there isn't much to be had. That said, there are some niche industries that do pay very well. Mine is one of them.

Yes, it happens rarely.   Just like parents sometimes have to care for their adult child when they're down on their luck, etc.  That doesn't mean either situation has an entitlement built in for everyone.  Scumbag husband is responsible for all of her joint debts.  Now, if the mother had a bunch of joint debts which the OP isn't telling us about, that would be a different story. Unless there happens to be a rare exception, the courts will easily rule against the mother which means the only thing she is going to do is decrease both her and the husbands wealth in legal fees.   That is why everyone refers to her as a scumbag.
Now that would be a sweet car to own! It probably sounds amazing!
(I don't know if you're speaking from experience, but I'll just address it as such)  I don't think people who cheat on their significant others plan it ahead of time. But I also don't think they have absolutely no idea what they're doing in the midst of it all either... Although, demanding empathy for your wrongdoings is a little ballsy considering the empathy should be with the loved ones you hurt.. and rightfully so...  Are you a monster? No, not necessarily.. But can you honestly say that you were thinking of anyone else but yourself in that instance? When I empathize with cheaters, I can only think that they weren't thinking of who they were going to hurt because otherwise, I don't see why anybody would want to go through with it. And it doesn't sound like it was worth it in your case either...

For every alive man the Others slay, they create one of their own. As far as I know there isn't enough Valaryan Steel and Dragonglass to arm everyone. And until its at their doors, it looks like most people don't even believe its happening.

**[tillicum](http://para.ms/reus/tillicum)**: [^^original ^^reddit ^^link](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rs74d/a/cdqjggm/?1rs7mb)  This has been going on since 1991, when the law this notice is enforcing was passed.  But, if it makes you feel better to think of it as a new conspiracy to confiscate your guns, go right ahead.  I guess doing research as to what the law is about is too much given it was challenged in court in 1996 (Richmond Boro Gun Club, Inc. v City of New York) and the court ruled in favor of the city (the case encompassed NY Code 10-301 through 10-310, which, as you can see, includes the relevant section 10-306) and was affirmed on appeal.  But don't let me hold up the circle jerk about this "new" law.

I was part of Local S6 @ BIW a few years back.  That sticker jumped right out at me.
I love all the hatred towards Brian saying Andy is way better, when in reality Andy is the one interpreting Syn's style. It's pretty pointless in my humble opinion to argue which guitarist is "better", when they both probably are near equal of skill. It all comes down to the quality of the music that is written, not the speed a guitarist is able to play at.

Georgia does not want us to win. You never cheer for rivals.
He ate and apple covered with peanut butter a day for months under doctor's supervision for The Machinist, his weight loss culminating with the shirtless scenes.

Article is entirely fluff with no backings on it. As someone who works in the mortgage industry, I was looking for actual details on what fraudulent activities were being committed.   It claimed appraisers who do fraudulent reports are getting all the business. Fannie &amp; Freddie both have strict appraisal review guidelines that make BS value hard to give. Not only that, if a loan sold to Freddie or Fannie defaults, they analyze anything that the lender has done wrong and force them to buy it back at a loss.

Yeah, but the supporters aren't nearly as outspoken and a lot of fans have this sense of entitlement because you guys were so good in the 90s.  It's a shame because the talent is there for Nebraska to be competitive with the top of the B1G, but between the rumors that their coach is going to be fired and the success of other divisional "rivals" (as far as I'm concerned Nebraska only has one rival and they didn't play this year), the season has gone up in flames.

Oh I completely understand the out of context sarcastic and dimwitted reply you gave to a simple question.  What I don't understand is why you think that your opinion is necessary or helpful to anybody.  By giving an angry and condescending reply you've only shown how useless you are to this thread.  So it's probably best you take your comments elsewhere. If it was supposed to be supported by Microsoft then it must not have been such a devastating proposal that would destroy every game publisher.  Whether or not you agree with it isn't the question.

I am aware that laws are not perfect. That's why they should be revisited and updated periodically. If the law isn't effective, then it should be changed. If it give the ATF too much power, then that should be changed also. I can't help but notice that the most recent gun control law you mentioned was passed almost 20 years ago...maybe it's time to revisit the issue?
If you're right then it is racist for me to say that, and I apologize for that. I have personally never heard anyone say aks who was not a black American of questionable educational background.
That's a fairer assessment.  Your original post only mentions the WWE billed weight and your argument was based on your own weight and not liking the idea of him being that much bigger,  which is pretty moot.  I see what you're saying now though.  But as someone who's been trying to get into bodybuilding for years,  I personally can't guess weight for shit.

If the allies had used purely asymmetrical means in either World War we would surely now be living in German Lebensraum. Asymmetrical warfare is great for bogging down the enemy, demoralizing them, causing large amounts of disruption with limited resources and guerilla tactics. Of course it played a huge role in many symmetrical wars, but for example, you can't fight Blitzkrieg and attempts to level your country with an informal force.   Two great examples of asymmetrical tactics being used by a formal army are the Winter War and Continuation War. Finland managed to inflict massive casualties on the invading Russians, stopped them and demoralized them, but ultimately the resolution of both wars was the formation of peace treaties in which Finland ceded territory. Finland could have caused serious damage to the Russians if the wars had came to their end without a treaty, but ultimately even though Russian was already fighting on many fronts concurrently they still would have eventually swamped the Finns.

His last Olympia title was in 1980 at the age of 33... which isn't too far off from when most people should start considering HRT anyway.

A lot of people in this thread mentioned that their fanaticism just decreased over time but my situation is pretty different. I didn't get into kpop until a year or so ago so and I was already a mature adult when I started liking it so I feel like I didn't really get the chance to ever reach fanatic levels of adoration. I remember when I was super into anime in high school, I wanted to spend all of my time, energy, and money on anime and I didn't give any fucks about who knew. As an adult I often get *really* into things but I can't ever let them impede on my daily life. I have adult things to do now.   With kpop I am super into a lot of groups and I actually like constant flood of rookies because I love new things but I do my fangirling in a highly prioritized fashion. I pretty much just stick to gushing on reddit and occasionally soompi and other sites. I recently discovered that there is a group of kpop fans that meet at my university but I find myself not wanting to be part of their group because they're treating kpop like I treated anime in high school. I would love to occasionally just get together and binge watch all of Infinite's reality shows or try my hand at learning some fun dances with friends but the people I talked to in the kpop club don't know when its time to stop. If that's the way they want to live their lives then that's their prerogative but I just can't connect with people who *live* for kpop like I used to be able to connect with people who lived for anime.

Try [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Graph-Theory-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486678709) on Graph Theory.   It's an introductory book, aimed at people who have never seen "real mathematics". The format of the book is similar to what you'll see in any college-level mathematics book. Not method, method, drill, drill, drill, but rather: definition, proposition, proof.  The author works up assuming little more than a background in basic high school algebra. He goes over the general idea of mathematics as the study of unambiguously-defined objects through logic. He gently brings up the basic language of sets (used in all modern mathematics) and takes extra precautions to clarify many common misconceptions.  He then builds up the machinery you need to understand the fundamental ideas in the subject of graph theory. Eventually, he gets to the point where you can prove the 5-color conjecture and he gives most of the proof of Kuratowski's theorem (the characterization of planar graphs).

No, the government created 'war on drugs' is what keep the cartels paid.  The obvious rational solution is to legalize and regulate all drugs, and treat drug use as the medical problem it is, rather than the legal problem it isn't.  If people want to be drug addicts, let join some program, work a dead-end job for their fix, and have a safe, reliable source that the government can profit from.  If drugs were legal and regulated, a huge portion of the organized crime world would disappear, because they make almost all their money from providing a product that people want, but are otherwise not allowed to have.  Every country that has decriminalized drugs or otherwise made them easier to obtain has seen a massive drop in drug related violence and crime.

I went to a college far north in California. It was about 2, maybe 3 hours away from the closest in-n-out. Now, most of the people that went to this university were Southern California kids, if not out of state. Eventually we decide we MUST have in-n-out. So we get a bunch of people together and decide to head that way. Now, keep in mind we didn't decide that we had to do this until about 10 o'clock at night (we were also high and super determined). The way there was on a super windy road and eventually I fell asleep because it was dark and my high was wearing off. When I do wake up we're in the in-n-out parking lot. Awesome! Except it's 2 in the morning and it's closed. We contemplated just sleeping in the parking lot and getting it in the morning  but did I mention this was during finals week? So we had to drive back to campus pretty disappointed and hungry.

Heres an obvious statement. One has to bring in slaves to work for slave wages. The provinces control minimum wage. In BC kids 16 and under can be paid less than Minimum wage. So now BC employers have the kids competing with their unskilled parents for minimum wage work, and guess who gets the jobs. Corporations, the one I worked for claims wages are 80% of the cost of their business. So if they are making record profits, its pretty obvious where the profit is coming from.

As a kid who grew up sans-Santa (Jewish!), here's why I'm tempted to go ahead and do Christmas with my child:  1. Santa promotes the idea that someone out there recognizes and rewards good deeds. This is false, good deeds as their own reward, but the act of starting to do their gift-giving just as they're old enough to stop believing should help get that message across.   2. Kids will hear about Santa from their friends/classmates no matter what, so why not help them take part in the fun of it instead of being the early skeptic? Mystery is magical to kids.   3. Santa is a safe, loving, neutral character. I have read the sweetest stories (and sometimes heartbreaking, which I hope won't be the case for my kiddo) -- the sweetest stories about what kids will ask Santa for, and confide in him.   4. Santa draws attention away from that whole silly Jesus in a manger thing :P

Because a line has to be drawn somewhere. At some point, it has to be not ok to get an abortion anymore. I mean, otherwise, you'll have some woman who feels her water break, and decides she isn't ready, and wants an abortion. At some point in the pregnancy there has to be a point where abortion is no longer ok. If that line has to be drawn somewhere, I draw it at self-awareness.

*backs away from you* What is WRONG with you?!
Seems like you're putting the cart before the horse. Sure, some Austrians (i.e. Hayek) are unopposed to empiricism, but the ABCT was derived deductively. Pointing to evidence to back up a theory is different from pointing to evidence to formulate a theory. For example, the Austrians saw the housing bubble coming; they didn't have to wait until after to say "Oh, seems like keeping interest rates low until they inevitably ratchet back up screws up the economy." Sometimes clues from empirical evidence help point one in the right direction to deriving a sound theory, but Austrianism generally doesn't use empiricism; rather it uses synthetic a priori (and sometimes analytic a priori too)
Can't wait :D

...how does this answer the question?
1) Vorkasse = you send them the money yourself via wire transfer (payment will take 2 days)  2) Sofortüberweisung = similar thing, but you let them do the wire transfer for you (payment is instant)  3) Lastschrift = they will bill your account with the money (usually is processed as instant, even if money will be charged a few days later)  4) Credit card / Paypal = credit cards are not common for everyday use but they are for internet transactions  5) Kauf auf Rechnung = they send you the stuff instantly and give you some days/weeks to wire them the money  6) Nachname = postman will collect the money (usually charges extra)  i would not really recommend 1 and 2 as you have to trust the vendor a lot. If he defaults or is a scammer you will not see your money again. Amazon uses 3.

calculus and Differential equations are significantly different then basic algebra and basic math. My school's math topped out at trigonometry, which, if i remember right, four entire people took my senior year.  I think if we don't teach people to leverage the tools we have, then we are crippling them. A computer is a tremendous force multiplier for thinking, and not treating them as such is a disservice to everyone.

Not everyone wants the same thing. Honesty is a good trait, that's something to hold on to. But being blunt can hurt people where a white lie could soften the blow. It's not just to make people feel good it's also to keep them from feeling bad.  The world isn't black and white. Everyone says they want the truth but not all people can handle it.

Some stores are very particular about how they fold their clothes. I know Old Navy made us fold them on our chest in a very specific way and I can only assume other stores have their own methods.  You sound like a great customer so don't worry about grumpy employees. There's a point where retail associates can become their own worse enemy.

I think TL's system is awesome and I spoke to them a little in the past about it. I do not think there is a way we could implement such a system, though (I could be wrong, I cnt rly compooper).  We could have a basic list ranked as you suggested. But when you go to view it you have no way on knowing who out of the many hundreds are actually online. it would get tedious and I am not sure anyone would really bother checking them all.

Either one seems a bit flawed.

If I make $300k a year then Olive Garden or Red Lobster isn't fine dining. But If I make $20k a year the $20+ a plate dinner at Red Lobster is going to be fine dining to me.

K processors and Z87 chipsets are meant for overclocking. You're getting a locked processor with the z87 chipset. unless you specifically want to SLI two or more video cards, there's no reason to do that. either change to an unlocked processor (K version, 4670k) or downgrade to H87 or H81 chipset motherboard which will be cheaper.  I'd get an R9 280x video card since they perform equal (sometimes better) to the GTX 770 and are cheaper. they can be had generally for $300.  that ram is really expensive. There's no reason to pay $100 for 8GB of RAM. [here's](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#z=8192&amp;n=2&amp;sort=a10&amp;t=11) a list of 2x4 GB RAM (for dual-channel which may be beneficial for your audio production) from cheapest to most expensive. cheap RAM is good RAM, you're only really paying for brand names + customer service and sometimes a fancy heatsink  I'm not sure about mobos and firewire. mine (z87-a) doesn't have a firewire port but my case has a front-panel firewire port which is kind of annoying.

I got fucked over in middle school by my guidance counselor, and so did quite a few friends. Because of her, even though we easily passed our classes, we are a year behind on math and science. Whenever I tell someone that, they are confused because I am smart (but extremely lazy), so it's a nuisance. I could've been in a lot more advanced classes this year (senior), but I guess it turned out for the best, I am partially happy with the way things have turned out.

In my experience:   Having to duck more often, bending down to pick things up, increased risk of muscle injuries when growing up, having to get things in high places for short people, kissing shorter people, getting beds/mattresses that are the right size, clothes - especially if you're skinny, shorter guys trying to look tough by starting something with you. That's just off the top of my head, other people might say more or less.

&gt; the first written laws were Hammurabis code and by far those were brutal and only served to put a system in what was already happening   You kind of restated what I said and I never said religion was all truth. The understanding of the world is an understanding of how one should govern their self. Our understanding of the world is through physics so we understand that we as people can not fly so we don't jump off buildings expecting to fly. I said our morals are rooted in religion, religions have changed so our morals have changed and because our morals and religions have changed so too have our views of the world and our selves changed. Religion is supposed to govern how we view what is around us and how we are suppose to on a moral level react to that. Religion as you say was made to help us understand what the world is and once we understand that we can understand how we should conduct our selves in our world.

I think others have said it as well, but there is a lot going on here that isn't ADHD.  Aside from that though, his medication should help - but it isn't a panacea. Plus, even long-acting meds like vyvanse only last so long. And come-down can be a b!#ch: for some people it can feel worse than no meds at all, but be worth it even so. What we need to do is use the medication to help us learn *and then employ* other ways of coping. By that I mean being able to do the things we want to be able to do. He has got to want it. What's more, he has got to be able to see that there are other ways life can be.   For example, when I take my meds, I can sit here all day and read reddit. I can do it really well and write wonderful, insightful posts. Or, I COULD get up and do one of the million other things I have to do. The medication makes it possible, but I am the person who has to break the habit, you know? Same thing for your man. He has gotten into some bad habits. He has to choose to break them. The medication is the first step. A big, important step, yeah. But still only one step.   You can't change him, of course. You can only change you. It's an old saw for a reason. You can help him change once he indicates he wants to, but that is it. What you can do now to help your ADHD-related relationship issues:  -  Let him know what is going on with you. We add'ers can be totally clueless about other people's internal processes. He might be totally shocked. Preferably do (gently, respectfully, non-threateningly, not in an "unburdening myself" style) it in writing because we forget stuff and miss stuff and it will be good for him to refer back to. I might say something like, "Hon, there are some things that have been bothering me lately. I am going to write them down and email them to you so we can work it out, okay?"   - Figure out what you want. Figure out how you can get it. Both with his help and input and without it. For example if you want to be able to go on vacation without having to worry about his behavior toward travel companions or him getting overwhelmed, you could ask him to be sure to modulate his behavior by not doing X,Y, or Z (this is a perfectly valid thing to do). Or, you could decide to not go on vacation with friends and make it a bit more of a low-key affair. Ideally, you would do both. Let him know what you are planning to do, and why.  -  Get educated on ADHD. You sound really compassionate and patient and like you really want to work through this. More information on the disorder, what it is and isn't, and some tips for living with it can only help.  - Figure out what you can and can't live with. Is the pr0n a deal breaker for you? Or maybe just the using it while at work? The complete lack of companionship? It is completely fair to have your limits, communicate them to him and expect him to respect them. You may have to help him figure out how to do that - and you should certainly be willing to do so if necessary - but it is absolutely okay to have them, whether or not he has ADHD.   -  Cut your losses. One of the most helpful things my therapist said to me was that I may never get a handle on the housework thing, and that maybe I was one of those people who should just hire a weekly cleaning service, and that that would be okay. I finally accepted that and called the housekeepers. Cut my stress level in half. Sounds like you have done the same with that one. This may be an extreme example, but maybe he just isn't capable of the type of sexual relationship you need and you should write that one off and go for an open relationship.   A couple of things: First, like everyone else in the world, he is trying to fulfill his needs. His needs might just be different than your typical "unafflicted" person (for increased stimulation but not too much stimulation, for example) You guys have to figure out how he can fulfill his needs while still maintaining your relationship. Just a bit of perspective shift that might help ;) Second….hell, I don't remember what the second thing was. Well, good luck!
Forgiving someone for something they've already done in the past and sincerely repented for is not the same thing as forgiving someone for an ongoing series of actions that continue to harm you.  Even then, you could work to stop the actions while forgiving the person for wanting to do those actions.  TL;DR: Hitchens was deliberately misrepresenting the nature of forgiveness, as promoted in Christianity, to make a cheap rhetorical flourish.

Good news: No matter what happens, your life won't end. You won't fall to satan, you won't go to jail, and you won't get pregnant/addicted/a disease. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and you're just feeling overwhelmed at the moment, and you are experiencing pressure from your father to believe one thing, and pressure from your youth group to believe another.  See if you can get in contact with someone you trust to talk these things out. The less biased they are towards one way or another, the better. Take this time to focus on yourself and what you think is right. It's scary to try and live without the safety net of a church, but it can be done, and it will help you come to grips with /why/ you're falling into temptation and peer pressure now.  You're a strong enough person to do the right thing, no matter what your situation. Keep that in mind, and don't stress too much. Shit sucks donkey balls when you're a teenager, but even if these years feel like an eternity, they'll be over before you know it and you'll be able to go to whatever church you want without your father breathing down your neck.

But what happens if one team takes a long time to fix their issue and ends up taking 20 minutes of the pause time.  Then if the other team has a problem they have a lot less pause time to work with.
They know the rules. They're getting DDOSed and can't really do shit about it. Once your IP is out you're fucked unless you literally move houses (TSM did that in Season 3 btw). Quantic can't afford to break their lease and move to another building to change their IP. 
The 10 minute rule, although harsh, I understand the reasoning behind it. It keeps things going. However, this rule is fucking retarded. You are at a disadvantage playing 4v5. It should be an option for any team. They may say it's to preserve competitiveness for the sake of the audience, but people would love to see a 4 man team take it. Such rules are mainly for the spectators to keep things smooth, and not staring at indefinite pauses. However, there is absolutely no reason to not allow a team to play 4v5. We all have stories of winning games 4v5 in solo queue. Sure, this is fives, and it will be much harder, but the team with 4 doesn't have no chance. What little chance they have, they at least should have the option to fight with what they got.
Slightly off topic, what version of Star Wars should I get? I've never been a huge fan, but I've grown to like them, I want the blu-ray versions because, well blu-ray is better, but I've been warned against that?
Yeah. I really want them back on Craigslist! Those were hilarious. Kyle is a genius. 
ALttP is certainly worth playing and if you intend to play them both, playing them in order is probably a good idea.  ALBW is really good and ALttP would be diminished by playing it directly after ALBW.
OMG...That sounds delicious!!! From Subway?

I was told by several friends that they heard I broke up with my girlfriend at the time, but couldn't find a place to live, so I crashed on a swing in her backyard for about two weeks. Apparently we only got back together when she was uncomfortable with someone who wasn't her boyfriend sleeping in her backyard.
Another twin. My sister is currently having treatment for breast cancer - she's 26. She's the strongest person going and single-handedly holds the rest of the family together while coping with this disease.

You can check the music of live shows from the show's twitter, which i believe is @Xananp (paradox correct me if i'm wrong). Hypothetically you could scroll through that twitter and match the tweet date to the show date, then you would know.  There are ways, people. =P

Not more than once a month, IMO. With the amount of streams there are, Once a week would cause the front page to be spammed with them every day. It would also cause each stream post to be more meaningless.  Have you been thinking of cooperating with the streamers though? Something like "stream of the week"? Like Riot used to do the featured streamer thing, except done by the mods of the subreddit.
Skip the massage and look into [floating tanks.](http://tranquilitytanks.com/)  I tried it there for the first time about 3 weeks ago and it was easily one of the most relaxing experiences I've ever had.  You can also add a pre-floating massage, but I can't vouch for that part of it.

Simple splits like an upper/lower, a push/pull, or even a push/pull/legs are better than all the complicated body-part splits in my opinion. The biggest problem with the brosplits is that you don't hit each body-part very often, and you hit it with way more volume than you really need. There's basically no reason to do 20 sets in one session for your chest, a relatively small and simple muscle, and ignore it for a full 7 days.

I had surgery on my foot and it wouldn't heal properly so I was on crutches for 5 months as they didn't want me walking on it. Shortly after the surgery, me being on crutches made sense but as the weeks went on, rumors started that I was just using the crutches for 'attention'. I didn't have a cast, no brace, regular shoes. By about 3 months in, the rumor was that I had never had surgery at all and was just using crutches to be dramatic / get attention. Also as occasionally I would walk across the room or up/down stairs without using them out of convenience, that confirmed I didn't really need them.  I really didn't care that people thought. By the end I was messing with people, switching 'hurt' feet and feeding into the rumors!

Something I haven't seen really mentioned is trades of draft picks. You can have a mediocre team trading a pick to another team to get a good player now, but with them being a veteran, they don't have the longevity to them, and since they have to switch to a new team/scheme, they might not live up to expectations. That negates the benefit of the bad team having the high pick and helps out the good team.  Same thing for draft day trades of picks. You see teams like the Pats trading to move down and stockpile picks, where as you can see those bad teams will be the ones who pay to move up, sometimes just a few spots.  Although I guess this is a specific detail of what falls under a bad front office/bad draft. A bad front office does a poor job of determining value in trades, resulting in a bad draft (and helping other teams have a good draft, which hurts them even further).  Then, when you have such a bad front office, or impatient owners, the front office/coach can get fired pretty quickly. This does nothing to help with stability in the process of building a good team. The new coach and GM can have an entirely different idea of what to do with the team, and need more time in building the team that they want.
An idea to make the "series" better would be to match cards which are in most decks used for "identical" purposes, instead of cards with "identical" effect. Someone talked about a yeti/taz'dingo comparison, since those to always fill the same slot in the deck, that value 4 drop minion we all want.  In the same way you could do Faerie Dragon/Ooze - since they are both good 2 drops in any deck, but for completely different reasons, so there is more to debate, like who should use which and when

That's only a myth that started during slavery as white women saw the penises of nude slaves often and viewed the men as beasts.   Edit: Further, many black men hate that stereotype because it often leaves women with high hopes unimpressed.

I'd be interested in seeing where this build goes.  I'm not sure that there's a very competitive brew, but the black removal suite in standard right now is so powerful, any good synergy backed up with thoughtseize and heros downfall is gonna be decent.  For reccommendations, I'd try to keep the curve pretty low with Angel of Thune being the absolute top.  Some low cost removal, so you can take advantage of multiple extort triggers is gonna be important.  In addition, you're gonna have some trouble with Supreme Verdict, though I'm not sure any good answer is readily apparent.  Gods willing / brave the elements might be a good answer to various spot removals or anger of the gods.  Whatever you end up doing, please keep me posted, I think it'd be interesting.

My mom still has mine... She probably would have done this if Facebook had been around when I was born. 
He's not being reasonable if you look into Apples actual complaint. The court order said the fee's for the Ebook monitor would be 'reasonable and customary'. Apple has shown that the guy usually charges $500 an hour (not really reasonable to double his usual fee), that Apple has never paid anyone a 15% fee on top of legal fees (so it fails the customary clause there), and the fact that Apple has never paid any lawyer as much as this guy strongly suggests this level of fees isn't customary. 
No MRA would try to justify it because it isn't justifiable.   I'll add that 100 babies die every year in the US due to botched genital mutilation. No plaque is ever placed though.  But that's a good thing because they're male! Right?

I took the survey yesterday, and it was general questions about what I've done in ingress, like how I heard of it, how often I play, and questions about internet access, technology use, and gaming. I didn't get questions about zipcar or the other promo stuff, probably because I'm in Australia.  I first tried the survey on my nexus 7 and got the same message about doing it on a desktop, so I switched to my laptop to continue. I probably could have opened it with a browser set to force desktop (I use a Firefox extension called Phony) but my laptop was next to me anyway. It's odd that a mobile game survey doesn't work on mobile though, if you're keen to provide feedback, maybe contact them directly?

Spoken like a true non-lawyer. On the contrary, Supreme Court precedent since the early 1800's holds that, "It is **emphatically** the province and duty of the Judicial Department [the judicial branch] to say what the law is."

See also: The definition of stare decisis and the reality of politics and religion in this country for an answer to why this particular precedent won't be "overturned."

I think 50k with coinbase is no big deal.
There may be some social underpinning behind this concerning the perceived image of "beta" males being "creepy", but really, the findings are pretty reasonable and predictable.   Having "very pale skin" was presented with questions about being unkempt, having greasy hair, dirty clothes, and acting shady. I imagine that the being presented the questions in tandem was painting a rather disconcerting image.  Odd that "bird watching" is creepy, but whatever. Perhaps it is the idea of a person in the park with a pair of binoculars. Who knows. 
OK, that makes it a bit more challenging to explain as M20 assumes you've played D&amp;D.   I haven't played Warhammer, so can't help with a comparison there, but if there are other games you've played, I (or someone else) might be able to clarify.
Glad I'm not the only one.
