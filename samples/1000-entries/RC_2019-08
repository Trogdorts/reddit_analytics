The purchase thing titled "first round of summer" sold it for me, as well as the fact that they introduced Verica into this event for no reason this far. There was no necessity for the fortune telling "hoist" to happen, that could've been resolved in other ways. Also, I know CyGames is generous, but not stupid. I believe this banner is a bait and the next one will be limited. Guys, wait until the last day to blow your stash Stay strong!

High Elf for extra damage or Breton for additional cost reduction. Honestly I use High Elf and haven‚Äôt needed the extra sustain that Breton provides.

Or, why not both lol? OP's post did say we need more variety and more Strikes=more variety. I never said that adding D1 strikes back in was the end-all, be-all solution to the problem with the Strike playlist. I just think it'd be nice to get some of the oldies back because D1 certainly had some damn good Strikes as well. That being said I am certainly open to more suggestions and absolutely agree with your belief that they should find other ways to improve the playlist beyond simply dumping in more strikes.

More Americans in top leagues, the better so football popularity can finally skyrocket in the US and can compete with garbage sports like NBA, MLB, NFL and Nascar etc.  A lot of American mums are taking their kids to soccer instead of NFL these days so the next generation football will take over the US while their 3 letter garbage sports will be on decline.
Aha, that makes sense. Thanks for the details, friendly stranger!

You obviously are if you are automatically assuming the race of anyone posting. If you were going around calling people who were offended by anti-black racism as "fragile blacks" you'd be the most blatant of racists. But somehow you've managed to convince yourself that this is different.   You really need to step back and take a look at yourself and how much of your time is spent espousing blatant racism. Kindly shut the fuck up now. Don't respond, just think about it, racist.
Can't argue with that
That is a problem, but it's a problem due to exceedingly large number of immigrants. You can't just abandon laws because there's too many people.   You could increase facilities and staffing, but that requires quite a bit of money and the government would have to agree on how much money. The government isn't focused on agreeing right now.

Yes, my rom in my posterior chain is locked to squats, deadlifts, presses, and curls before running. I did put on too much in too little. I did my first 5k in week 2, 10k in week 3, and half in week 5 from the start of running. I've ran multiple halves, and I've also done a number of 5/10ks on trails. I usually train in zone 4, but that's because my times are slow. Zone 4 will get me 9.5 min/mile at best but more along the lines of 10 min/miles on average. If I trained in zones 1 or 2, I'd practically be walking. I do cycle in zone 2, however. It is also possible that I overshot my estimated lean body mass, but I didn't think I overshot that much.

I've read TXCraig's recipe, but I assumed a lot has changed since 2010. I knew Mangieri did a 24 hour rise in SF, so I just assumed it was cold ferment.  However I just found this interview from 2018, he specifically says "never refrigerated" and the dough "sits unrefrigerated ... no longer than 24 hours". I might experiment with this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Qp5fKkavM&amp;t=105  I've seen a lot of recipes that have you drop the starter right into the mix. If done properly, it might have the same outcome. But the levain lets you make last minute adjustments before you're forced to commit. I'd rather waste 200g of flour and 1 day on a bad levain than 1.5kg of flour and 3 days on the whole deal.  That's awesome you got an Ischia culture. I've heard (from Mangieri actually) that the culture matters less. As you feed it, it'll be taken over by your local yeast cultures anyway. Not sure how true that is. Maybe we can compare starters some day to find out!  We followed the Tartine starter recipe. So ours was cultivated from scratch in San Francisco. We keep it refrigerated, feeding it every week. Feeding goes like:   * 100g existing starter  * 100g water  * 50g whole wheat flour  * 50g white flour   We keep it cold simply because we're not very responsible.  We'd kill the thing if we had to feed it daily.  After feeding, I let it rest for at least 8 hours. After that, the starter is bubbly and develops a slightly acidic smell. So not super active, but alive and hungry. Then I'll make a levain from that. The remaining starter goes back in the fridge.  Before using your starter for pizza, I would recommend making a sourdough loaf in your home oven. If you can do that, then you know your starter is ready. One less variable. Can't recommend the Tartine book enough.  Oh, you're going to love the new oven. Game changer. Honestly, the oven is the most important thing in all of this. In my home oven, I tried recipe after recipe, and the slightest variable would ruin the whole thing. At 900 F, those variables have far less effect. A year ago I was very scientific about all of this. Now I have breathing room. Every pizza I've made in my Roccbox has been phenomenal, literally since the first one. Same with the Napoli oven (though I'm still a Roccbox Stan). Now I'm able to focus on perfecting the technique without worrying about ruining pizza night üòÇ

!!!!!!!!!   Saved this comment to my favourites list, that‚Äôs for sure... oh my god wow, I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better reaction. I am so flippin psyched that this was somehow your dream scenario! That is the beeeeeesssssssst  How I came am up with it was more or less something like, ‚Äúhmm why aren‚Äôt there any cousin audios? that‚Äôs almost like, a kinda more socially acceptable form of incest (since even royal blood lines contain many marriages between cousins)... plus, everyone has at least one hot cousin, right?‚Äù   Once I sparked that thought, the idea for the set-up came easily and I just ran with it! I think I wrote it out because I didn‚Äôt have the privacy to record in that moment, and I didn‚Äôt want to forget it or lose the inspiration. Otherwise it likely would have been recorded as an improv audio, and could have wound up being completely different!  Gotta say, if I somehow seem to know your sexual desires better than you do, well we must be pretty damn sexually compatible ;)  It‚Äôs rare to get a comment like this publicly... usually it would be a PM if anything. I really hope you don‚Äôt delete it, because I think this comment serves as a really great example of a special and highly memorable response. I especially appreciate the way you sandwiched in some sweet sentiments that show me that you think of me as not only a sexual object of desire, but as a real flesh and blood human being, with actual thoughts and value and dreams.   *‚ÄùWhat kind of sorcery is this?‚Äù* is my absolute favourite. I‚Äôve heard it only once before in my life, and it will never cease to make me smile.   Thank YOU so much gubald!!

If that's considered child support, then he has to pay. He'd have to show significant changes in circumstances to get a modification. At least in the US, child support gets priority over just about everything else, up to and including garnishing half of one's income. Not dischargable in bankruptcy either.
Also, most who live abroad will not actually have to pay taxes as they will already be paying more taxes where they are. Filing taxes is not the same as paying taxes.

If they go the Linux and Android app support route, they just have to worry about making sure the apps run, instead of making apps.

Oh but but those are private companies and private companies can do literally whatever they want except refuse to bake gay cakes. Even if there are no other options, the founding framework of our nation does not apply to companies that operate within it. In fact, government should not place any regulations at all on private companies. Now let's focus on real issues like banning private health care and regulating domestic manufacturing out of existence in the name of fixing climate change.

No, not everywhere else they are better. The US police force has a bad rep, well earned, but there are [countries much worse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_killings_by_law_enforcement_officers_by_countries). Im not justifying the US police acts in anyway, but there are countries that are inhumanely worse. Namely the South American police.   As awful and heartbreaking as it is to see these videos, its better they come out so we can see whats really going on. Something you dont see in countries like Venezuela where an average of 1632 people per 10 million people are killed.
Simple humans can't understand that the "bad guys" from every movie, even the ones with the most plot holes, always have a reason to behave in such a way. Nobody is born evil and evil is not the right term for someone who has gone through so many breaking points in their life. It isn't uncommon for us to somehow relate to these characters portrayed in a bad state, because we understand them, and the more we think about it and dig into it, the more the "good guys" seem unlikeable and these "bad guys" appear as 'good' and their actions are more rational, well-calculated, but also justified.
Not yet. It‚Äôs working very well minus that rear fan. Temps are great.
   *Bronx suddenly felt desperate and afraid he would have to stay in that well forever; what a slow and miserable way to die. He began to panic and in doing so felt his body slowly floating further down the well. "Please", Bronx called out to the cat lady as she turned to leave, "don't leave me in here, I beg you." Bronx never felt so desperate. "I have travelled to the wrong dimension by mistake, so sorry. I will not stay in the dimension beyond Astraquat. I will be leaving very soon", pleaded Bronx. "Do not speak, humanoid", said the Centaur, "You will be lost sinking further down the well. Have pity on this humanoid", said the Centaur to the cat lady. "I too make promises to you. He will soon have the code to his dimension. He will be gone from here in three circles of the sun. Help this traveller from another world as a favour to me", said the Centaur.*  ¬©2018 Mordecai Jonathan Lynch (P)2019 Mordecai Jonathan Lynch
First of all, if you can‚Äôt raise another man‚Äôs kid then you should not be dating her. If you‚Äôre going to be in her life then you need to know that her daughter is part of the package. Secondly, you two have been dating for 5 months and you two aren‚Äôt getting married any time soon so maybe focus on getting to know and be comfortable with the kid. If you can‚Äôt handle that then leave so she can find someone better
I thought it would be a tie breaker but no. He told me that children aren't expected to go to elementary with kids form preschool and I can't possibly know that kids from his preschool will be attending the school by my house. Except I'm friends with other parents from there and the preschool informed me that they do have at least 3 kids who will be using them for after school care - and the school by my house is the only one they pick up for after school care from. He is trying to dismiss it. But I think it's really important because transitions are already hard, anything that will make it easier is my goal. (And my daughter's friends was the reason he used for not switching her to a much better school - the one by my house - when he lived in a different neighborhood - and the judge sided with him because of her friends. Now I'm using his own stuff against him and he's not having it? UGH. Narcs.)

It'd make sense, but on Okada's side, he could lose to Evil and Sanada and feud with LIJ for the rest of the year, making Naito a logical final rival at WK. I still believe that one of them is going to win the tournament, not Moxley, Ibushi or Okada. There's a reason why they're going to have a match in the block final, if both have chances it's a 50/50 scenario, but I'd go with Naito because they haven't faced one on one in the last two years and it's still the biggest match New Japan could possibly book for the Dome. Jay is great, but I feel it'd be better to give him the G1 next year, not now. It'd be too much too soon in my opinion, let him struggle to come back to the main events for a while.

Depends who you ask. Some of the top players don't believe in embleming anything but 5*. Mid range players believe that embleming some 4* are definitely worth it.  Wilbur, Boldtusk, Kiril, Rigard and Guardian Jackal/Falcon are some awesome heroes you will likely still use even if you have a 30+ 5*, so I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to make them stronger.

To be fair, it's not "the best strategy", it's a game breaking exploit that almost always guarantees the win.

Man, I really admire that kind of playing. Actually, my main objective is to become as solid as possible before getting super mega chops, when I started what really inspired me was guys like Jaco, Marcus Miller, Wooten, but now I just wanna be like Palladino you know? (I'm not saying that Pino Palladino don't have chops, but it's not his style to show it every time).  I think the best compliment someone gave me was "man, you play so good that I'm ashamed to tell you that I play bass".   I'll never forget that one.  But this guy must be a horrible bass player, because I'm not that good to deserve such a compliment.

Is it the young or the old one?
While it is true that age is often more ambiguous in stylized artstyles as compared to real life that lack of realness is another mark against the producers and consumers of loli shit.   If a real adult has physiological features that are similar to a child's it is rarely ever the result of anyone's choice. They just happen to look like that. And if a real person is photographed or filmed in a sexualized way then it had better have been the uncoerced, consenting choice of that person. Otherwise there's a problem and maybe even a crime.  This isn't the case for characters that aren't real. If a character is drawn with physiological features similar to a child's it's because the person drawing them wanted them to look that way. And if a character is drawn in a sexualized manner then it could only have been the choice of the person drawing them.  An adult with a baby face wanting to take nudes of themself isn't really a big deal or all that odd. An artist wanting to draw a childlike character in a sexualized manner is at the very least a major red flag for that person either being a pedophile or producing content for pedophiles.

There's a keybind to turn ESP off in ship movement (I think) keybinds.

And you can't get a degree soon because you end highschool at the age of 19. Add 5 years to it and congratulations, you wasted 33% of your life and you haven't even worked yet. I doubt I will ever reach retirement... they heightened the retiring age again. And you can't even do stuff like martial arts or part time jobs because you can't be both at school and at the workplace. Besides hobbies like self-defence or art or sports are expensive ... and you can't get expenses because you're uneducated.  I had only 2 part time jobs... the first one scammed me of 20 Euros and gave me no money back. The second part time job was a garden department in Hornbach during heat waves. I was surrounded by a bunch of entitled women who worked there and they even wanted to ditch me away for not handling the Manly work well enough.  Let that sink in... me, an allergic... in a humid garden department for a week, 9 hours a day on a direct light ... I was sneezing and scratching all over.

I happen to specialize in the field of corny puns.
Thankfully this field is so vast and complicated that even with tons of new grads flooding the market, my salary remains fairly high. If these are the next generation of coders that our going to hit my area in a few years, I think I'll be fine.
I think what they need to do, since they clearly won't do an overwatch brawl system where we can just pick our damn game mode, is a system that brings in 1 big game mode during weekdays and the smaller ones on weekends with full support.  &amp;#x200B;  So for instance on mon-fri have something like "One for All" and on the weekends(sat-sun) have a "brawl" that either randomly selects or lets you select one of the smaller game modes like Overcharge, Odyssey, or the star guardian event, etc.  This way people can have alternatives to SR or take breaks from SR without feeling obligated to do so. Right now, any time a new mode comes out, people swarm to it because it'll go away and they need to get their playtime in before it's gone for another 4 years. If they came out with a consistent system it would be healthier for the game, people could casually take their breaks from SR while still playing league, and the "impact" on queue health wouldn't be overly effected because people aren't swarming the gates of any one specific queue.

**B√©la IV of Hungary**  B√©la IV (1206 ‚Äì 3 May 1270) was King of Hungary and Croatia between 1235 and 1270, and Duke of Styria from 1254 to 1258. Being the oldest son of King Andrew II, he was crowned upon the initiative of a group of influential noblemen in his father's lifetime in 1214. His father, who strongly opposed B√©la's coronation, refused to give him a province to rule until 1220. In this year, B√©la was appointed Duke of Slavonia, also with jurisdiction in Croatia and Dalmatia.  ***  ^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^] ^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28

So far, yes, and it‚Äôs one of a few reasons I am strongly considering resuming HRT. I feel like my emotional responses have been deadened, except for anger, which comes much more quickly and fiercely. I don‚Äôt feel content anymore, just numb, and even anxious or dissociated. I cannot think of a time since stopping HRT that I‚Äôve felt happier.  Can‚Äôt really speak to crying since I wasn‚Äôt a frequent crier on HRT either.

When I was five years old, we had a neighbor from Estonia, who spoke with an accent. At the time, I didn't really understand the differences between ethnicities and nationalities, but I was starting to notice these differences. One afternoon, our neighbor was speaking to my father in the driveway, and I just blurted out, "What are you Chinese or something?" My parents promptly sent me inside.

What's the source for this one, my good sir?
It's like the cop wrote this himself FFS. It doesn't even mention the parents until the second graph. I spent 9 years in the press, this absolutely should have been the lead and probably the headline.

Commenting a little late here but, YTA  My mom thought my mental health was hormonal too. Up until my freshman year of college. The untreated mental health problems spiraled, and I tried to take my own life. She even said that the timing of my suicide attempt inconvenienced her. This post sounds just like her. We don't talk anymore.  If you don't send your daughter to therapy, and actually follow through and listen to her and support her through it...your going to lose your daughter one way or another.

hes not a 26 year old saying this, i think you guys forget naito is 37/38 and definitely in the latter half of his prime.  the push for naito to win the g1 is beginning. i called this a few days ago, but moxley isn't winning any more matches, because as soon as he gets to 12 points naito is rubbed out of the g1, as moxley has the head to head win over him. this will start tonight but moxley losing to yano, if you are clued in this should be so apparent. yano will end the block on 3 wins, over the 3 top dogs of the block. white, naito and moxley

THIS IS WHERE REALITY MEETS PREPARATION lol
It is what we currently see and their apparent positions.  We don't know where they will appear to be in a number of years equal to their distance from us in light years (where they are now if you like). Predicting the movement of cosmological scale structures over hundreds of millions to billions of years is difficult.  Models are chaotic (small initial state variance compounds into huge long term differences) and our initial measurements are almost non-existant.  The distances are so vast - and our measurement window so comparatively short - we've only just started detecting motion of galactic clusters (relative to expansion that is).  Furthermore the phenomena of dark energy and dark matter are poorly understood yet we know they will have a significant impact.  Finally over scales this large how the objects themselves will change can't be ignored.  The life-cycle of celestial objects, collisions, black-holes...too predict where everything currently is would require being able to perfectly model the universe.
He didn‚Äôt learn any different things from them. She just let him continue and even scolded the other woman for touching his stuff. Both were cussing. Why can just anyone have kids? It‚Äôs such a flaw in humanity.
I bet Melky did but I think the organization values his veterin presence over whatever meager return he'd get (zero chance of any exciting prospect) and I don't think it's out of reason that nobody would be interested in Liriano.

None of these options will help him stop barking when he's nervous.  Consider it from his point of view - something scares him, so you hold his mouth shut and speak firmly, or he gets shocked or sprayed in the face. Would that make him less scared or anxious? Nope. The opposite.  If he's barking because he's scared you need to address *WHY* he's scared.
I think there is a sub for that, but I don‚Äôt remember the name.

Yeah it's great, when billions are dying due to this disposable climate destroying culture that we are promoting, we (whomever's left) can all celebrate how much profit was created.
I'm with OP. It's certainly possible to write human characters that are morally opposed to slavery in a believable way, but it's *almost always* done (on this sub) in a very heavy-handed way, rather than done with the subtle touch that good suspension of disbelief requires.  If everyone would at least include a little more philosophical ethical debate before they send the humans in to free the slaves, that'd be great. A "hey, this will massively destabilize the economy and probably kill a bunch of the slaves in the process" and a "why don't we do this economically instead of militarily" consideration is A+ in my book.

Do your family members know what's going on? Even though living with them may not be an option, if you're having to work in secret just to regain your independence, then it would probably be worth reaching out to them privately to see if there's anything they can do for you.  If not them, and if things continue to worsen, then you may have no choice but to have the authorities involved. Since I'm not there with you, I don't really have that firm of a grasp on the situation. Going with this footage and the background information alone, I will tell you that all of this is very concerning. Please, don't be afraid to reach out for help if you have to.

So, ive been go to these s.a. classes for like 16 weeks.  And every month they drug test me. Every single time she took a peek at it and said it looks great. I never worried. But this last two times, she says they go to a lab. In the beginning I assumed they were instant. They have color changing stickers on them. She told me I failed a week after. Then had me do two more in one day. The two in one day she said they looked too clear. I'm highly bothered.   What a good idea!!! Every time I go to the p.o., I bring every single form of documentation I've ever received and always keep my receipts. I'm going to do that. That sounds exactly like what I'd always do. I'm just so confused and scared.

73% of Mexican Exports are to the US.  [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/mex/](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/mex/)  15% of US exports are to Mexico.  [https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa/](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/usa/)  If you follow those links then you will see that it is a similar story for imports. Mexico is massively reliant on US imports (51%) and the US only imports 14% of its total imports from Mexico. The US has a diversified trade portfolio. Mexico does not.
I can name em all except bottom middle, I‚Äôm wracking my brain trying to figure out what it is üòÇ
But the other problem you're failing to mention, one that I would argue is bigger than the third in the middle, is the people who will refuse to vote at all if they don't get who they want on the other ticket. Getting the flaky left, and the flaky center, and the up for grabs middle all at the same time is going to be the big problem. It was in 2016.

  After all this is a show for tweens and Young adults and even if it‚Äôs more logical for the soviets to use many companies, it takes to much time to explain that to the viewers. One is belivable and taking extra time from the viewers to set up more is just unnessecary.
This gas station is super safe though.  They've got bars on all the windows and the door locks when you walk in.  The cashier even politely buzzes it open when you need to leave from behind his thick glass enclosure, the customer service can't be matched.

I think you're being too hard on Staal. He bounced back a bit from how truly bad he was and I think many people dont give him the credit for that. Hes not a great player but he can play 3rd pairing minutes on the left side and can play the PK. None of that can be said about shattenkirk who plays on the right side, where we have talent, and we dont need him on the PP anymore. He also cant play the PK as competently as Staal.

I've actually never thought of that but it could additionally help with a lot of things besides acne. I'm in my late teens and have been getting lots of hot flashes, nausea, dry heaving, and migraines, especially on my cycle. I've been thinking it could be linked to a hormone imbalance. I'll definitely see a gyno and listen to what they have to say. Even if it doesn't help my skin, it could help with other issues that I have. Thank you so much for the recommendation!
I leaned more toward the western dragon look because the brawny look fit Jake's personality more and I thought it was a way to represent his mixed heritage but the eastern dragon look grew on me pretty quick.  Now if you want someone who got it bad in the redesigns in that show look at the Huntsman. [he looked rad before ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/e/e3/Huntsman.gif/revision/latest?cb=20120517234858) but then in the redesign [he looks like a foot clan ripoff](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/b/b2/Huntsman_Season_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111018225838) but I'm also probably being biased because glowing eyes in a silhouette is one of my favorite design tropes.

In the video you can see she is kicking him.  Honestly if your on the ground in a one on one with an officer you shouldn't be surprised if he backs off and tases you.  Not to mention he has no idea if she has any weapons at.  I'm not normally one to defend cops, but in this case I don't really see any wrongdoing.

When I was living in an apartment complex, I met this cool girl in the middle of the night during a fire emergency. Since I just met her, I wasn't sure hey relationship status. So I said to her "I'll bet this will make a good story to tell your boyfriend." I didn't fool her for a second. She figured out right away that I was hitting on her. But she thought it was cute and we started a relationship. Five years later, we were married.  A part of the trick is chemistry. My wife and I clicked right away. As a friend of mine puts it, "women are not slot machines you put friendship coins in and get sex out of". What's important is to know the difference between romance and infatuation. Believe me, when you meet someone you have a romantic connection with, you'll know.

I‚Äôve had mine for 7 years, my first and only car. I‚Äôve driven it about 60k miles (previous owner put 50k on it so it‚Äôs at 107k). People always rail on em but it hasn‚Äôt caused me that many problems honestly. The motors go eventually, usually around 100k plus or minus 50k depending on how you treat them. Mine went out at ~75k, replaced under warranty. Had a clutch assembly go out around the same time, also warrantied. About a year ago I had a clutch master cylinder die, wasn‚Äôt warrantied but it was a fairly painless fix (minus the 2or3 times I had to get it replaced AGAIN in the following months but that was because the O‚ÄôReillys part was doodoo so I only paid for it once). Biggest pain I‚Äôve had is when my cat went out.  There were a few (namely the ‚Äò04 automatics) that broke left and right. Honestly I don‚Äôt think rx-8s break any more than a lot of other cars if they‚Äôre oiled and taken care of they just get a bad rep.   Super fun car to drive, zippy and a unique noise with enough juice to beat a v6 mustang in the 1/4 mile.

Just because the victim chose to forgive him doesn't mean everyone else has to forgive and forget. There are so many actors out there in so many movies, I don't want to support someone who threw rocks at kids and nearly beat a man to death just because of his race.
YTA- if she was willingly talking to him and slacking. You should've just warned her about how it could fuck up her life so you give her a choice to mess up her own life.   You're NTA- if he forced or persuaded her to slack and procrastinate, then I understand why you'd tell her to dump him because it wasn't her messing up her own life, it'd be him messing up her life and being long distance he has no repercussion if he messes up her life.

A mentally ill man neglected to take his prescribed medication, something which sadly happens too often and can be a cyclical problem. The man the  decided to take cocaine. While in an altered state and without their medication they spiraled into a mental breakdown even attempting to run into traffic and actively resist police. Due to the sedative the police assumed he fell asleep and made dark jokes on the scene and failed to realize his quick decline.   Im sure every officer wishes they knew what was going to happen so they could have changed the outcome but hindsight is 20/20. hopefully this doesnt happen again and it might change policy. ultimately I think its sad for the guys family and friends.
House's struggle against drug abuse is one of the saddest things I've seen on television. He knows it's bad for him but he just can't stop himself.

Steins;Gate for sure fits the bill. It's a time travel mystery show with heavy slice-of-life components and some genuine trauma thrown into the mix, just because.   And then if you like that, you can always watch the follow up, Steins;Gate 0, which delves into failure and PTSD and geopolitical tensions.  Also, seconding everyone who has said Mushi-shi - a strange, quiet, meditative little show about paranormal creatures and loss - and Evangelion, which is perhaps the most psychologically complex and moving anime I've ever seen.

You think, but you still try to pull through, the black knight is first, he got a blue ar and found a green pump on the ground, your dead, you think, but you build and you build, you get behind him, start shooting and, YES, he's down, now the wick, he got a blue pump and a tac smg, ok NOW your down, you think, but you do a build off, he gets some hits with the smg but you get shotgun hits on him, you here a noise, he switched to his shotgun, you got to be fast and careful, you build him in then edit a window in and shoot, he's low now but so are you, he gets out and starts shooting, you somehow get away behind a corner, this is it, you can get him, as he gets close, you go around the corner and, BOOM BOOM, it's over, you won, you get there loot and leave a happy man, I used DARK knight and John wick because I'm thinking back then

I was more into acid that shrooms personally. But my point is all that shit can lead down the same road as heroin and alcohol does. Just because it‚Äôs not your experience and you haven‚Äôt witnessed it doesn‚Äôt mean that it doesn‚Äôt exist and can‚Äôt pose a problem.
You're making some very strange assumptions to justify Longstrike and the bodyguards.  Yes, you can give Longstrike that many wounds with a unit of three crisis bodyguards, for the bargain price of 90 points if you take all the guns off (where did you get 96 points from?). That's if you never want those bodyguards to be able to fire a shot because nothing is ever going to come into range of them - that's why you took a Longstrike and Hammerheads, they're long range heavy support platforms.  Yes, you can even give them a 6+++, but now you're also dedicating an Ethereal to your Longstrike protection detail. It sounds quite a lot like you're just building a castle now, and any troops choices you have on the table are either going to be denied Storm of Fire/Sense of Stone and the Ethereal's leadership buff, or you're paying for a second Ethereal.  As for the damage output of the Broadsides versus the Hammerheads, I did misread the BS but I strongly disagree with you about their damage output. In your army, you're relying on Longstrike to buff their overcharge and damage output, but Longstrike is a character with &gt; 10 wounds and will die on turn one against any army with some damage output of its own. You have the pleasure of easily overtaking the Broadsides for exactly one turn against most armies, and possibly not even your own first turn. It doesn't really matter that he has Fly, because he's going to be blown up from a distance - he only has a 3+ save, no invuln, and the game's most expensive ersatz shield drone posse to take wounds for him. The game currently punishes single large targets hard because it is so easy to just focus them down, and Longstrike represents a large target that has no cost-effective way to survive anywhere into the midgame.  That, and put Longstrike against the current termagant/poxwalker spam that's becoming hilariously popular, and you can look forward to making a few dozen models extremely dead each turn against an army with 200 of them. :v

I work with mostly older people and hear this constantly.  Really? I was at the gym after my shift last night, I called three internet companies and the vet this morning, I tidied the kitchen shelves, cleaned all the wood floor in the house, researched for my side gig, took my wife lunch, picked up the shopping, brought in the laundry, and here I am for an 8 hour shift. And I'm at the gym after this one too.
You know you‚Äôre allowed one headphone, right?
I think Apple is different in this regard, the brand loyalty is strong enough for a large subset of their users that the almost have to provide long term support so they don't do any damage to that brand loyalty. Its really unfortunate. I think Samsung and Google can make some major strides in these areas in the next few years to come.

YTA.   It takes a **LOT** of courage for someone to reach out and say they need help, let alone therapy. Please, please, please, do not compare her situation to anyone else because you do not know what is going on in her head and it sounds like she isn't even sure herself, which is why she is telling you she wants to go to therapy.

I know it‚Äôs bad to say that, but who actually cares, man? I remember when I was a kid I played games 12,16,18+ and I was far from being even 12yo. Bro, I believe you just need to relax and get whatever you feel may be interesting, instead of cutting yourself out of many interesting games. I‚Äôll tell you more, 18+ games right now are far from games that used to be 18+,  but 10 years ago.
My hack for losing water weight is hibiscus tea. OMG it's amazing. I just guzzle the heck out of it, and also water, the day after I have a cheat meal/day. And instead of 3 or 4 days of bloat, it's all over in one hibiscus-infused day and I'm back down to the regular weight in a day or so.

Thanks for the advice! I'm just worried that they will send me to collections or try to charge me some type of interest if I don't pay up. I don't intend on paying up for a transaction I never made or approved on.
Is.. Is this heresy?
You can stop paying NJ tax once you're a resident of Texas.  The determination of being a resident is often facts and circumstances based, but in general once you move there with no intent to return to NJ, you've established yourself as a resident of TX.  Now you should do all the normal things a resident of TX would do:  Get a TX driver's license, register to vote in TX, have your mail delivered to TX, buy/rent a permanent place to live, etc.

They always try to make it out like they are trying to help you get paid more too and we're all under paid, but really dems will just take more from you and redistribute it to their rich friends and a few scraps for the poor.  Some of us are underpaid; mainly due to unrestricted illegal/H1B immigration in my opinion, but still live well enough and just keep keep voting for economic policies and lower taxes.   It's kind of like the whole wanting "common sense" gun laws and secretly they cheer for forced gun confiscation.

My skin care set order comes tomorrow.   I never used lash slick or the rosewater spray before so I‚Äôm excited to try them out.   Also, they forgot my seasonal sticker. What is going on with them? This came from Ohio. My other order is coming from Ohio as well. Did they stop doing the stickers altogether?
How exactly does it narrow his range though? I don‚Äôt think leading here puts enough pressure and will often times leave you guessing and blindly barreling.   Check raising however puts a lot of pressure on 2 overs and middling pairs. Then that turn is great since you pick up a ton of equity although it does improve a lot of villains AK and KT which are possible flop floats
I'm down any advice will help.
Thank you! I'm a photographer, which to be fair is better than many other jobs I could have chosen, but I ended up with a lot of not so great clients who either don't pay me on time, or aren't willing to pay me enough for what they demand of me. On top of that, I'm tired of having to drive an average of 1.5hrs-4hrs every time I have a job to do, and I'm tired of carrying multiple pounds of gear and being on my feet for sometimes 8 hours straight without being able to take a break. The particular industry I'm in can also be very pretentious and a kind of self centered. All of that has slowly been chipping away at my enjoyment of it, and I'm now at the point where I dread every single job I have, and instead dream of being home with a brush in my hand.  My heart's just not in it anymore, but painting is something I have been drawn to my whole life, and my experience so far (I've been at it for about 2 years) has been a million times more enjoyable than photography ever was. I've met great people, everyone is supportive of everyone else's work, and it's a much more welcoming community in general.  I know that turning a passion/hobby into a job is an easy way to end up hating it, but having done that with photography I know what kind of mistakes to avoid in order to keep that from happening with art/painting.
Yeah I felt like this situation puts me in too much of a crunch. I'll most likely reschedule and use the extra time to space out all the studying.

It's nonsense.  I was born and raised without any religious belief and free of woo such as ghosts and spirits.  I never thought gods or weird things existed.  My home wasn't rigid, a lack of belief wasn't taught--we just never did religion.  Life was still full of amazing books, movies, art...always had an imagination.  Things are fun to think about on the fantasy/fictional level.  But they were never entertained as a potential reality.
Lmao I guess this is sparty country. All in good fun though right??

Especially how people reacted to his comments. Sure, there's valid points people brought up, but a lot of what he said was valid too, and like you said a lot of it boiled down to people being very rude and then complaining that he voiced his own criticisms back at them. Which makes him still responding the way he is now even more admirable.

Basically the only reason is because most rails are probably being bought to get thrown on some cheap rifle with a cheap scope and then shot at a deer 30 yards away and they've got 19 rounds out of their 20 round box to zero for the season and they don't understand the fancy lines and shit in their scope and would probably just assume something is wrong with their setup with how far off that first shot might be with 20 MOA rails when they go to zero.

I agree that the Giants should've sold Smith, he's a great closer in a year where teams are just desperate for them, but Bumgarner probably wouldn't have had a very big return, not for two months of a pitcher that all signs indicate has somewhat declining stuff,  and the Qualifying Offer they can place on him boosts the odds of keeping him around for a few more years (and it keeps the fans happy) and recuperating a draft pick if they can't.  Not enough to call them winners, but certainly in the middle of the pack, and the obsession some have with "THE GIANTS DIDN'T SELL SMITH OR BUM" just misses the forest for the trees.  Biggest losers are definitely the Yankees and Dodgers. How the fuck do you stand pat when there are still relief arms out there that you desperately need? Not to mention the cavernous hole at 1st base...

No, I'm not saying that at all.  I'm just saying that YOU don't know for a FACT that it means before 8/13.  Which is entirely the whole catalyst for this conversation between us.  YOU made the absurd factual claim that the list is being released prior to 8/13.  YOU reinforced that claim by posting the same source we all have and gave us YOUR INTERPRETATION of the announcement and ADMITTED that you were only assuming.  YOU then doubled down after being called out and are trying to deflect.  I'm in the corner of "We don't know"  You're jumping from the "I know it's coming before 8/13" corner to the "I just assumed" corner to the "Well the odds say" corner.  Just give it up. You claimed you KNEW when it was coming out. You've been called out. Take the L and move on.

I'm confused. Sorry. I am a professional and earn a decent living (or so I believe). I live in a modest house ($80k). I only buy used cars, go on vacations that cost less than $1,000 after saving all year.   I haven't experienced anything but living paycheck to paycheck. If I were to get in a car accident and subsequently not be able to work, we'd lose everything.   I can't fathom what life would be like *not* living paycheck to paycheck.

Wouldn't actually. At this point it would still be a majority of conservatives. But at least a few liberals would make it in due to the large liberal centers in Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. In the long run it wouldn't change the balance in the senate more than one or two votes.

To be honest I don't really care about this whole MTX controversy (again, I have online access, so I'm not their market), but there are a lot of them who have problem with that, and microtransaction has been seen as a controversial business model, especially in a pay to play game.

That‚Äôs a good question. I don‚Äôt really know the answer to that, but your suggestion sounds reasonable.

It definitely doesn‚Äôt happen to every pump that runs dry. But I‚Äôve ONLY ever seen it after pumps have run dry, so it‚Äôs gotta be related.  Why it happens to some systems and not to others, I don‚Äôt have a definite answer for that.

We just lost our greyhound Daphne to canine osteosarcoma about eight weeks ago.  Same exact thing as you, actually:  a slight limp that wouldn't heal, turned into a devastating diagnosis.  We followed our vet's advice and spared her the suffering of aggressive treatment that she said would have bought us a month.  While I would have done anything for that month, I don't regret our last few days together.  Take lots of pictures.  Eat lots of hot dogs together.  Cuddle.  So many pets.  Sleep on the floor next to your pup.  You are going to need these memories to get through what's coming.  Internet hugs, kind stranger.

You can't speak in absolutes like that. There are too many variables to claim someone with a high ping is *always* at a disadvantage.  Our squad got wiped by a guy that had 800ish ping. Couldn't be sniped. Couldn't be touched. They were "rubber banding" causing them to teleport. The 'spraying bullets into someone and not hitting them' issue is prevalent in this game regardless of ping.  In fact, rubber banding with high ping is common in every multiplayer video game I've ever played all the way back to Unreal Tournament in 1999. PUBGM has some particularly bad netcode.
FlashForward. Hands down, best acting, best concept, great production. Ahead of it's time. Only one season. The only show I wished would jave continued.
I love when the community strong arms the devs into changing their vision into something more safe.   Changing the gameplay lf ‚Äùlook at map and run at red dots‚Äù would be a possitive thing. Making the devs go back on their decision before we‚Äôve even seen gameplay is disgusting. I would understand if they changed it after a beta.

" The so-called stubby **squid** (Rossia pacifica) is a species of bobtail **squid** native to the northern Pacific Ocean "  The official title of the video even says squid. The scientists in the video are just guessing at the time of filming.
Raviolis' are boiled, smaller in shape and are (usually) square shape while Peirogis' are usually fried come in semicircle shapes and are larger
Oh look another Killer Cop who wont go to prison to killing someone in cold blood. Fuck cops and fuck you if you support them.
Tie my shoe with the one loop. I had to teach myself to tie my shoes, when my dad just didn't actually show me. So I had to learn doing the two loop method. To this day I still don't know how people do that with one loop. I just wear flip flops now.

Well it appears I'm the only one who lives in an apartment here! I wish I could, but I can't have a sub in an apartment. I know what it sounds like from neighbors who had them, and I won't do that to others. YMMV.

That's what made me a fan so many years ago. She tore herself a new asshole after a loss in am interview. Her brutal honesty was shocking and endearing
Can you just STFU for like 10 minutes

Thank you. I didn‚Äôt know it was through it‚Äôs bite or through a lick or what  This helps
I attended the New College frosh last year and the theme didn't really matter towards the overall experience. I recommend you attend your own college frosh because you can meet ppl that are also in your program and can help you on later in the year(speaking from experience).
Stan Lee is going to be one of those figures that ebs in and out of good favor as time goes; sometimes he'll be in good light, sometimes in bad. I think that's how it's gonna be.

Great choices! Don't let other people hold them, do cleanse them with incense (there's other ways but I find this the easiest), and you're on the right track!
Welcome aboard! You will find that languages have different approaches to various aspects such as communicating about time, word order restrictions, how they show grammatical roles and relationships in a sentence, how they write symbols etc.  I hope you enjoy the learning journey and the resources mentioned earlier in this topic are a good start, along with Wikipedia articles on language and just general Googling of course. Ask questions here when you need to. Be aware that even linguists don't always agree on how certain things work in language or the best terminology to use.  It's too early yet (I think) to give you anything other than very general advice. So here are two suggestions, recycled from people with more completed languages than I have.  1) For your personal language, if you understand it and enjoy it, then job done. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.  2) If you specifically want a language that looks natural (real worldish) then a more sophisticated approach based on linguistics knowledge will nearly always be better. The main trap appears to be to incorporate every cool idea you come across without checking that you need it and that it doesn't create difficulties somewhere else in your language.
Damn, I'd love to have that in my mouth
Yeah its bullshit. If you use your boost on the TUR stage you only get 1 extra and using boost on this stage only gives you 7.
Why even have something that high with products? Not like anyone can reach them? Oh wait I see the ladders, that will certainly help get to the top items.   Idiots.....

Hey look, someone who doesn't understand how game development works. Shocking.  Anyways no one ever said Viera are gonna be stuck with their current hair, in fact they've said the opposite.

Thank you @/u/cruncruncrun. I ordered some cbd chews (with glucosamine and chondroiton) and a sling to help him up the stairs. Fingers crossed he starts improving.

Tracking down the original Dokument would of course be even better than this article.

They hesitate to do a VU for Udyr because each udyr skin is practically an ultimate skin in that it has at least 4 models to work with. That's 3-4 times the work, not including gameplay and conceptualizing phases. Even if you use the same rig/anim for all models, they still have to make sure every model/stance of every skin, works properly, dont have clipping, is visually clear, translates hitboxes properly, etc.  This isn't to defend riot, but just to understand why they're hesitant to go with udyr vgu

I'm alot less worried about the people "nutting over guns" than I am the socially ostracized people that we fail in this country to help in any way that lose games of Madden and go on a killing spree.

My border collie seems to live up to his standard. I may not be a farmer but my wife was running a day care and he would keep them within the play area when he was little. Other than that we do various tricks with a frisbee.
I agree and feel the same way. Like my life has it's issues but isn't THAT bad but between personal stuff and geopolitics, wtf are we all doing? No power except over the basics. And I guess that has to be enough?

According to Wookiepedia, the Resistance *might* have a few: "As the Resistance U-55 orbital loadlifters were being destroyed by the Supremacy after they evacuated from the Raddus, General Leia Organa tried to imagine a miracle where Inferno Squad returned from their mission to find the Resistance's allies in the Outer Rim Territories with a task force of Starhawks" (The Last Jedi Expanded Edition)
It adds brackets because it is ambiguous and will be interpreted differently based on where you came from. Since it is based on british standards it clears up the ambiguity by adding brackets. Instead of equating it to 16.

I have done partial hospitalization once and I am about to do it again soon.  It‚Äôs mostly group therapy with the occasional one on one and focuses on DBT.  I found it helpful the first time. I felt good being around others that could relate to what I was going through and it also gave me structure
Those "bugs' are really just the lack of driver support and it's resulting lack of hardware graphics acceleration. Mojave isn't really working on your 1080 Ti and likely never will. You've misunderstood what the person you are responding to has said. He said it's disabled, not that the card is working.

Invisible Choir and some other shows have covered the Kendrick Johnson case.  Very fascinating if you are not familiar.
F2p players are carrying both skills.
I bought a condo seven years ago at the bottom of the market and the real estate lady (i.e. the seller's agent) called me couple of months ago (yes, years after the sale) about some other condo nearby asking if I knew someone looking to buy. Yeah right, the people I hang out with won't buy anything at the prices which went up  2.5 times and the only people who do are the simps moving in with their special snowflakes (guess whose $$$ that is, lol?). So I knew it was not it. Sure enough, she's asking if my job is alright, how my investments are doing and ready for that ... if I'm looking for someone special because guess what, she knows a "good woman" who's just right for me. To that, I responded with "right for me for what?". And that was for relationship/marriage, of course. So I told her that the marriage is a scam and got the usual "Ah, you're one of those" bs. And then I said, "Yes, I'm one of those and that's why I paid cash for your condo." No further questions, your honor. I'm going to sell mine this year for 3 times what I paid in 2012 and will do it without any RE leach. Probably to some simp &amp; a snowflake parasite too. So yeah, the simps can be VERY helpful sometimes, lol...
fuck i‚Äôm in san diego :(
I prefer Beans and Rice myself
Shit happens, dwelling on it will just make it worse. Laugh at the shitty situation.
Day 3 was pure evil... my balls were so tight and I was squirming so much. Letting out small whimpers everytime I had to cover my mouth.
&gt; It‚Äôs in the non-ice age conditions that those become a liability.  Isn't it the opposite though? Ice Age made food scarcer and it became harder for them to maintain their bodies   &gt;We don‚Äôt see any significant changes in hunting technology in the overlap areas  Didn't sapiens develop that weird thingy that let them throw spears twice as far because it was harder for them to hunt?

I don't know the kid enough to hate him just because his father is who he was. But I'm of the belief that it's hard to fall too far from the tree in that region.
I know it's an incredibly different game, but switching to Warframe really blew me away having been used to WoW's payment model for so long. The amount of content you get in WoW for it being box sale + sub + macrotransactions (as Falcker_v2 put it) is unbelievably low. Blizzard in general also has a really poor policy about communicating with their customer base.
Both are basically done. STL is done, but the announcement will be in STL and got bumped back from tonight as a result. Sac not long after, weeks not months.

Do you really think people would have stopped and read what I wrote and written numerous replies trying and completely failing to argue that it isn't fucking stupid if I had just called it "baseless"?  No, but they did.  And whether I'm an asshole is irrelevant.  What's relevant is whether the argument is fucking stupid. The argument, remember, is that Fedor isn't the best mma fighter yet and we know that based on a 4 minute 46 second fight he had in 2018. So all those people who say he's the best yet based on his run in 2005-2007, they're wrong.  And is that argument fucking stupid? Yes, it is. So fucking stupid.
I‚Äôm working on this one myself. That first stage should not be putting up such ridiculous numbers that early. Also Jirens stun all is significantly more unreliable than MUI dodge.
Aim assist lowers the sensitivity while aiming at a player and if your reticle is not moving and a player runs by, it will move a small amount. That‚Äôs what it does and how it works

Awww.
&gt; You seem to have an issue with the DMV, where would you prefer to get your voter ID?  City or town hall would be best, though a Social Security or passport office would also do fine.  People shouldn't even be picking them up themselves; they should be sent by registered mail to the voter's registered address.
I don't get why he doesn't like the idea of universal programs. The progressive agenda is making college a merit based continuation of K-12, where anyone smart enough can continue their education. So what if a few rich people save 23 thousand dollars a semester, 10x as many poor people sa e that money and it means a lot more to them.  The issue with making rich people pay for it is you have to establish cutoffs, which gets messy. You could make the same argument that rich kids should have to pay for public schools, but nobody does. We will get their money through other ways.
To be fair it's totally believable that the fat orange fuck face would set this smug face as his profile picture
1. I'll give you that one 2. There's definitely poor dialogue at points, but calling most of it bad is objectively wrong. 3. Calling it a full on story is kind of ridiculous. Rescuing the wife is a one-off quest and nothing more. I never tried, but you might even be able to totally ignore it. 4. I agree with massive amounts of enemies, but it's the cult's major assault against the game's largest city to enact their ultimate plan. Duh. And regarding the weapon, it was made for the battle, and could only be fed ammunition from a giant bowl of metal balls behind the weapon.  5. Refer to other comment(s) on the spear. 6. On one hand idk why she did this, on the other idk why it negatively impacts the game. 7. Sylens was the entire reason Hades came to be after the plague, and therefore worked EXTENSIVELY with/on Hades. It makes sense that he has more control and input with Jades than we realize. Why or how he uses a birdcage, you got me there. 8. The Metal Ring, and the Sun Ring. That's it. 9. I'd love to hear how you managed to predict any of the major twists and story beats. I just don't believe this one. 10. True.  I give your opinion 7/10, too much water.
You say that, but if we're talking about the same widget making boxes, I've heard of worn tool changers chucking holders right through the enclosure. The plexiglass isn't perfectly strong forever, and any improperly maintained or operated machine is potentially dangerous.  I only mention this because "danger doesn't happen outside the magic box" isn't the picture I would want to paint for someone unfamiliar with the forces involved.
Definitely a unique sound. I'm not sure what genre this falls into but I'm into it. The intro is cool, but after that hard kick into the drop, I thought i'd hear something harder. I'd say drop the hard kick on the intro and leave it at the end to go into something hard.
fuck CNN and fuck their advertisers
Tbf Mad Scientist is one of the most broken cards in the entire game, so power-creeping that thing might not be the best of ideas
I'm a member! My husband is the one refusing to budge. He only likes one name period
My current project is named Black Phoenix which may be a work title or not. I'll see if I keep it or come up with another name.  In an earlier version of my story, there was a quite literal black phoenix whose feather would have saved the wearer of said feather from one death. That idea has been scrapped but the name has been kept because it still connects to the necromancer cult being named black phoenix as metaphore for the world they believe to rise from it's ashes when they have "cleaned" it.
Doesn't the beginning of the movie spoil that?  &gt;!It shows the car windows broken, and a long bloody trail into the house. So one can assume they killed and revived Gage. Or it's pretty much like the alternate ending.!&lt;

Totally. I struggle with the same thing! Supplementing iron has been really helpful. The supplement i‚Äôve found with the least GI side effects is Gaia PlantForce Liquid Iron. I put a double dose (20mg) shot in a glass of OJ and down it before bed - usually for a week or two out of the month, depending on energy levels. No GI side effects, and the taste isn‚Äôt awful - mixed with OJ it‚Äôs totally doable. Good luck!
English messed up when americans started changing words.
This isn‚Äôt about ‚ÄúI want this series instead of the video they posted‚Äù. This is about them fixing a monumental issue they created for themselves that isn‚Äôt fixed after nearly 5 days. Their communication for this has been pisspoor, and even though they said they‚Äôd be uploading the correct videos throughout the week, they failed to do so today in lieu of the SMM we got instead. Look for the context.

I miss Bad Girls Club... that show was so entertaining and what sucks the most is that their last season was one of the best in YEARS (exempting BGC15 because that was good, but not until Jaimee &amp; Jazmyn came into it).  Who was everybody's favorite Bad Girl? Mine will always be Kristen but I loved Catya, Tiara, Christina, Hanan/Suha, &amp; Briana
Huh
to be fair, said brother is a professional baseball player, though!
Ah, I didn‚Äôt know! I‚Äôm on the BL route right now, but that makes total sense.
Great addition to the conversation
Predominantly, it's because of the idea of hell. I just couldn't really grasp on the idea of eternal conscious torment being a just and righteous punishment for sinners and nonbelievers, and I consider an idea inhumane because the sufferings in hell are far greater than any suffering in the world.  For another reason, the Bible is just a horribly crafted book written by different authors in different times, filled with errors contradictions, ridiculous and barbaric laws, absurd stories, and senseless concepts. It's really a fanfiction book before fanfiction was coined as a term.
Well, yeah

I thought season 4 was also great and find the conclave episode to be among my favorite episodes of television period.
