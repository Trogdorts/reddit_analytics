This and Battlefront II (the real One) were the first games I ever played outside of Nintendo games. The 360 was super slow with this game and lagged a lot. I'm impressed by how smooth it is on Xbone.

Therapy helps a lot if you are consistent and put effort into it. I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre able to realize that they were your insecurities, that‚Äôs the very first step. I don‚Äôt know how old you are, but as you get older you start to care less. In my early 20s I was very insecure about my lack of well... everything. No boobs. No muscle. Why were guys picking other girls? But then I started listing 3 things I like about myself and 3 things I‚Äôm grateful for. Change takes time and effort.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong though. When I was with my ex he constantly commented on my lack of a butt and it got to me. When I went through his phone, I imagined that these girls he tried to hook up with had better butts and boobs than I did. That stung. A whole fucking lot. Especially when he would compare me to a random chick on the street in yoga pants. Long story short, work on yourself and forgive yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è

&gt; Microsoft on the other hand, well they have everything to gain. They don't need to copy how it works or infringe on patents, they just need to know what's in it and how well it runs.  Realisticaly they already known. They will both be using much the same AMD silicon (microsoft by the nature of their business has know a lot about more general AMD silicon) and there is a limit to what you can do with PCB design (and as the current gen of AMD graphics cards are demonstraiting upping PCB quality piles on cost to a worrying exent).  &gt;But Microsoft rolls out a targeted killer. It beats the PS5 in every benchmark Sony showed off, it sets the bar just a little higher. Then they drop the fatal blow, "our system is $50 less than theirs".  Not really viable unless there are prepared to take an even bigger loss than usual and/or an absolutely horrific failure rate.
Basically I'd utalize the bus on the board's PCIe slot with the SSD is what I'm gathering and seeing about PCIe M.2, except I'm looking at those price tags and nearly having a stroke for what I'd require for a 20,000 image project in terms of storage. Certainly in the future I would upgrade the system to a drive like this, but I still expect a basic SSD to perform faster then even a fast HDD in terms of transfer. May have to really play with the hard drive choices but certainly I don't think I could afford another 3k for a 4TB HDD with this build at the current moment.

Hot take but I think too many are focused on the wrong part of the spell book that wizards get.   1) Wizard spells are fungible with currency.  Yes a sorcerer can swap 1 spell for another spell, of the same level (or a different level up to 19 times) - A wizard can swap any spell in their list with enough coin. Some DMs being stingy with spell scrolls is a per table issue that is partially corrected by the spells learned mechanic. After playing a Cleric, Paladin, Bard and Wizard, I have always wanted more spells known or prepared.   2) Wizards are the best ritual caster class.  23 ritual spells that you can cast anytime you want without any spell slot used. Every other class needs to spend one of their limited spells known/prepared, or a feat to replicate this. You get it automatically. There‚Äôs no reason why a wizard couldn‚Äôt identify magical items, teleport you across the world or any other similar feat. Warlocks dedicate their whole subclass to be able to do that.   Wizards are to spells what Bards are to skills.  You don‚Äôt know all your spells like a Druid, Paladin, or Cleric but you come very close.  You aren‚Äôt as good at casting spells as a Sorcerer, but you can replicate some of that in specific schools. You don‚Äôt buff as good as Cleric, you don‚Äôt blast like a sorcerer, you can‚Äôt change the battlefield like a Druid, and you don‚Äôt mess either people‚Äôs minds like a Bard. But you can do some of that almost as good and still do well at the other roles. Casters are only as good as their spell list but wizards have the biggest and most diverse.

At least it makes it easier for them to change their mind about the more problematic elements of their faith, like polygamy and racism. The President of Mormonism can just call a meeting and tell the other church leaders that God told him racism is cancelled, and there ya go.   Mainline Christianity for instance has a lot of problematic things that Paul said in his letters which the church mostly ignores without any theological justification, because no one wants to discuss his defenses of slavery and wife-beating. There's no formal decision, it's just something that no one discusses unless they're fundamentalists.
I have the opportunity to upgrade either penny, heart watcher, or jahra to 10 star any input about which to do would be appreciated.
Edit after information given : YTA  You didn't mistakenly think you weren't invited, you were just being petulant because you hadn't been given an explicit invite. The people you mention as having gotten texts about it weren't even apparently given invitations; they were being asked to bring stuff/help out. He didn't give them invites and not you, if anything they had to work for their place at the party whereas your attendance would have been free.   I very much agree with your friends' assessment of your behaviour.  -----------------------------  Did you not go because you legitimately thought you weren't invited, or did you choose not to go because you weren't explicitly asked?

Rising of the Shield Hero is a recent favorite of mine. Action, little politics, some wholesomeness and a 100% engaging story. Also, Bunnygirl Senpai if you're into a more romantic and a bit supernatural kind of story.

Do you miss having too many thoughts in your head, now?
This took a few readthroughs to get an impression of the meaning, and it's still challenging to grasp (like a cat crouching beneath a bed). The diction is accessible; the syntax a puzzle. My gist is thus: since the qualia of [xyr](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xyr) cat the speaker cannot word-ize, instead of writing a poem *about*, [xe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xe#English) writes a poem *on* the cat ("I quickly throw ink on it"). Roundaboutesquedly, in lamenting on how xe cannot write about xyr cat, the speaker nubs the cat's qualities: "slip through my hands|in slippers of fur on the floor|like a door half-open"; "slits of sight"; "a few black spots"; "the scrape of the neck".  The poem is composed of semantic nonsequitors.  &gt;I cannot write about cats   the words they slip through my hands   in slippers of fur   on the floor   from a warm tail to the whiskers   like a door half-open   The first two lines make sense: the traits of the cat the speaker cannot put into words. The following lines communicate (sequentially): the zoomorphification of 'words' as wearing slippers; the slippers being on a floor; the slipping through the hands happening "from the tail to the whiskers"; the slipping being like a door half-open. The last line gives a tangential image of a cat peering, partially obscured, through the crack of a door. There's a sense of fluffiness in the use of the words "slip/slippers", "fur", "warm tail", and "whiskers". The half-open door symbolizes only catching a glimpse of what it's like to be a cat.  The next two stanzas may function as a single grammatical marathonic run-on sentence:  &gt;what does a cat know   that I wouldn‚Äôt reason   that escapes   my humanity   and my poem   more than its anatomy   what does the world shine   into those slits of sight   &gt;   &gt;but the cat‚Äôs shape beneath   the blank page   and I quickly throw ink on it   the page-cat-shape   and a few black spots remain   behind   caught by the scrape of the neck  The first lines up to "poem" reiterate the idea that the speaker cannot fathom the experience of being a cat. I see two valid parsings of "more than its anatomy": as applying to "what does a cat know", resulting in "what does a cat know  \[...\] more than its own body", ergo "cats don't have self-awareness"; as applying to the escaping of "my humanity and my poem", resulting in "the description of a cat escapes like its anatomy", which brings to mind a cat's body twisting free of the clutch of some-one.  The next lines ("what does the world shine|into those slits of sight") can be grammatically formulated as a parenthetical, interjectionary query - "\[...\] more than its anatomy|(What does the word shine|into those slits of sight?)||but \[...\]" - that re-reiterate the speaker's *shameful* ineptitude at first-person experiencing xyr cat. "\[S\]lits of sight" is musical description that matches the imagery of cats' vertically-slit eyes. It's possible slits of sight also refers to the speaker's eyes.  The next lines ("but the cat's shape beneath|the blank page") can be parsed in two ways - both result in a similar meaning to to "What does a cat know \[...\] more than its anatomy": as included in the previous parenthetical query, i.e. "(What does the world shine|into those slits of sight||but the cat's shape beneath|the blank page?)"; as answering the initial question "what does a cat know". If the "slits of sight" refers to the speaker's eyes, then the first parsing contains the additional meaning of "the shape of a cat is in my vision beneath the page of this poem". The inclusion of the word "shape" implies an incompleteness - it's not the cat that is in vision, but only its shape.  I imagine the next line being an independent clause delimited from the previous stanza with a semicolon: "\[...\] the blank page; and I quickly throw ink on it \[...\]". "\[I\]t", and the following "page-cat-shape", may refer to either the cat or the page: the speaker is either quickly "throwing ink" in a doomed attempt at transforming xyr cat into writing, or literally splashing xyr cat with ink.  The final three lines give different meanings depending on if the ink was thrown on the cat or page: if cat, imagery of ink splotting neck fur; if page, perhaps the cat's neck-scrape smudged off some wet ink (a bold-faced burglary!). There's suggested imagery of the cat naturally having a black-spotted coat, a cat's behind, and the edge of a page scraping something. "\[C\]aught by the scrape of the neck" is somehow musically and visually satisfying. It could imply that the speaker's attention has been caught by beckons for pets. The word "behind" interacts with the previous preposition, "the cat's shape **beneath** the blank page", implying imagery of the cat now (not) appearing behind the page, perhaps with some spotted fur jutting into view.  Long-a assonance profuse stanza three.  &gt;there it is   behold   my poetry on a cat   "\[P\]oetry on a cat" repeats the double entendre between "about" and "on": if "on" means "about", then the speaker is asking the reader to behold their poem; if "on" means literally "written on the cat", then the speaker is asking the reader to (be)hold their poetry-laden cat.  The trickily indirect way of trickling information behaves cat-likedly: semisensical impressionism; the phrasing of unphraseables.   This may just be a personal stylistic preference, but I think this poem would look "cleaner" with more proper grammar: capitalized sentences and punctuation. I suppose it would match the prim demeanor of cats. The syntactical branching would still be preserved, as far as I know.  Overall, this is a whimsical poem that has straightforward diction and challenging syntax. It uses some creative techniques (non sequiturs, grammar tricks, implied imagery, double entendres) to embody the personality of a cat.  As a challenge: try to fit the form of the poem into the shape of a cat (at least, I don't think this is being attempting already).  As another challenge: fluff up some of the diction. The close repetition of "slip" and "slippers" seems lazy. Some of the descriptors are dry and a-thematic: "shine", "remain", "warm", "my humanity".

There could be some other variable instead of follows or subscriptions. Something like an upvote? Or provide the equivalent of "cheers" for users to give instead of requiring them to purchase and spend bits to do it.  Some kind of way of saying "good job" - even if the person's stream isn't something they want to tune into all the time.   If someone clicks on my stream, thinks it is good.... but I'm not happening to provide the thing they want to \*follow\* - I won't get any positive feedback from that. And potential viewers will never know that person thought it was good. If they click away because they aren't into Darkest Dungeon, or just happened to get distracted by something... that looks exactly the same (to me and everyone else) as if they were clicking away because I was super boring or low quality.   Any metric like that would inevitably be at risk of abuse or manipulation, of course - but the lack of a "quality" metric is probably at the core of being unable to differentiate between tons of new/small streamers.  I could also see benefit from a kind of new-streamer mentorship process. \[which, if it exists - please point me to it!\] A place where new streamers could broadcast to a limited viewership (like a discord group). People could interact with chat and provide feedback before the streamer goes completely live on twitch to the entire world. As a new streamer in the past month, I haven't found anything like that. There are fantastic resources, and helpful people - but I haven't found anything organized around providing a "no-fail zone" for people to get things figured out before going fully live.

I built some pretty solid models a couple seasons ago using NFLGame python API from github user BurntSushi. Data for every player on every NFL play since 2009, easy to roll up to game or season-level totals. Definitely will help take your modeling to the next level.  Also check out scikit-learn if you haven‚Äôt. Basic linear regression model (including model validation) is like 10 lines of code once you have your dataframe set up‚Äîjust columns for y var (outcome, probably fantasy points) and all of your x‚Äôs (predictors) in the following columns.
This does kind of depend on how humans fair in gravity between 0 and 1g though. If it turns out that even the 90% earth normal that Venus has isn't viable for long term human habitation/normal reproduction we might end up only on rotating space habitats, using teleoperation from orbit to mine planets.

I live in a place where a LOT of people own these trucks. I'm used to this kind of behaviour, so I had to learn to get used to it. But it's really frustrating in the mornings, as I use the free parking lot every morning to commute to school. It fills up so quickly, that I have to be there really early to get a spot.  A lot of these trucks use up double spaces in this free parking lot, leaving a limited amount of parking for everyone else.  I guess I get it, it's your "baby" and you don't want something you spent thousands of dollars on to get scratched. But I can't afford to park at school everyday. Taking the bus doubles my already-long commute from 1 hour to 2 hours, one-way. Paying for parking at school is $7/hr and I'm there all day. I can't afford it either.  It gets really tiring hearing about how much money you spent on your precious vehicle, only to find that you take up multiple parking spots in that free parking lot.

You can, but that information isn't free from the land titles office and I don't think you can buy it directly from them. You need to go through an information broker. Google 'property owner search nsw' and you should find some options.

I‚Äôm interested in how this would affect the us election next year if Labour pulls it off. Would this give Bernie a better ‚Äòelectability‚Äô argument? Would it help people here see that socialism isn‚Äôt an impossible political position or would it work the other way and cause a backlash.

The common swap on the Miatas is the use the Ford 8.8 and then custom half-shafts to the Mazda hubs.  I imagine the same would work on the RX-8 as the PPF foundation is similar.  The problem is that I have yet to see someone come up with a great and easy swap.  It's much harder than say a Monster swap on a Miata because you need to get the gauges running with a computer AFAIK, so some type of excellent engine management.  A kit subframe would make mounting the engine better but I think almost any engine other than a 13b would require the steering rack to be moved, which screws up the steering and front suspension geometry.

Played a couple hours everyday for a year. Still went to work and my other normal routine. I'm at around 223.   PVP was the go to in order to get XP. Now the Collector role hands out XP like candy. I'm leveling up at a good pace with little effort.

My goal is to not just be another user-vote product‚Ñ¢ but to also provide the businesses with insights using many different sources of data, right now our only source is Stripe. Also, we want to provide you insights not only before to take the decision, but we want to do it also after, giving you reports of how much revenue you might be getting because of a certain feature.  Most of this is a WIP but we already started with the Stripe data source, to help you to make a decision to build a feature,  e.g:  1. How many of the upvoters of a feedback are paying a customer?   2. How much revenue have you got from them?  Etc.

Finally I grabbed my holy grail deodorant from Little Seed Farm in Jasmine Green Tea, Grapefruit Lemon, and Activated Charcoal scents.

Honestly not to sound rude but I was in the same boat kinda that he was.  I had a guy that really liked me and when we finally were able to be in a relationship it didn‚Äôt work out and I was crushed.  Still think about what could of been to this day.  It‚Äôs not always easy for everyone.

If you are taught something well enough from a young age then chances are you retain it into adulthood. Is that truly such a bizarre idea to you? My age is of absolutely no relevance and also none of your business. Nobody is even arguing that people can‚Äôt make up their own minds. You are responding to almost none of my points and elaborating on nothing. Again I remind you to look at the ideas not subjectively but you continue to ask me if I have children rather than address the points being made. I‚Äôve never owned a dog either but I think it‚Äôs safe to assume if you don‚Äôt train one as a puppy it will grow up to bite and piss on the floor. Do you want sources of studies and findings backing up my claims? I have done my research. Have you researched anything other than pooling your own ideas from raising your own children and what your friends say about their children? And if so offer it here so we can engage in discourse about either relevant information or we can debate the points I have actually made. However, I won‚Äôt keep arguing with you over arguments that I haven‚Äôt made.
Oh I do

I don't care. It doesn't affect my life. It's interesting, we've reached a point in society where people hate facts. You can dispute them all you want. Facts are still facts. I'm a fan just like anyone else here. I didn't wake up the day after these players were drafted and said 'Man I hope they suck' - But when a guy's been here for years, and he's not getting better, and guys picked after him are having career years, and those are the exact guys that you wanted...i don't know how people can defend that.
Yeah they're clearly the bad guys

Specifically in the early Smash scene (can't talk for other competitive scenes), it was used by players to get into their opponent's mind (competitive Smash relies a lot on focus, quick thinking and predicting or "reading" your opponent, disturbing concentration goes a very long way) but, as most things, it got way out of hand and tournament spectators weren't helping in the matter for obscure reasons you might've listed

To kill a mockingbird, a great classic. A lot of life‚Äôs lessons mixed in a spectacular novel. Can not recommend this enough.
It sounds to me like the father was just trying to make himself feel better and perhaps rekindle ties with his former family that he flat out ditched for his new family and made no effort it seems to visit with his new kid before the diagnosis. People have important things in their lives and I can understand why OP and her brother didn't just drop their shit and rush to see a kid they never met before. OP says they intended to visit, as well, the girl just died before that happened.
I am amazed the primer didn't get struck and fire the thing.
"Educated"... Meaning nuclear bad and being morons and attacking a coal mine? Do these idiots not want power? More Russian gas? If those idiots grasped science, they wouldn't be shutting down nuclear and doing pointless attacks on a coal mine...
I can safely say no one cared based on how few people even remember his old lore very well, and don't understand that the darkin Varus is the old Varus expanded upon.
Have you talked to her about this? I mean really talk - sit down, talk about how he had wandering feet, why on earth she would do this in the first place? Don‚Äôt get mad, get a mediator if that‚Äôs what needed to be in a good place mentally.   Immediately after that, if the convo doesn‚Äôt go well - What do your parents think? Time to spread word of this far and wide. Family peer pressure can sometimes accomplish what you alone couldn‚Äôt. If she goes through with it, it‚Äôs time to either remove her and him from family holidays, or yourself. Really depends which of you has more social sway with the family decision-makers unfortunately.
Oh OK. Very good to know. Especially as I only have a kettle at the moment. Cheers

I watched this movie but I forgot what it was about but it made these people rob a gas station drink poison Russian roulette, lose a tooth, made one get hit by a car another eaten by roaches and the last person had to dismember their friends legs and then they both died in a car crash on the way to the hospital   so
Bill Burr is that you?
because cr7 and messi are still cr7 and messi. demand for those players will be insane no matter what.  also, cr7 is the best gold striker in the game, and messi is the best \~cam in the game, a lot of people also say the best gold card.   also, the price is based on the demand for those players, not neccessarily on the real value.  is messi really worth 600k, or 50% more than neymar? probably not

The way it works now, attendees get tokens when they show up. So RSVPing doesnt really play into it (thus no shows isnt an issue). We just burn any left over tokens at the end of the night, thereby keeping the token distribution proportional to actual attendence.

If you're not  going with someone experienced, I would advise picking something small (2-3) pitches that's easy to bail from.   Leading will probably take you more time than you think, and if things go wrong, you'll want to be able to get off the mountain easily.
No offense, but that price is ridiculous. Of course I remember silverface Champs being like $100 when they were still being made.   From an inflation calculator: "What cost $100 in 1982 would cost $262.59 in 2018. "  For an apartment, I would consider a modeller. YMMV.

Thanks again, I didn't know they used to be the same clan.  When humans conquered the Continent they made the whole complex on Thanedd a magic school. I wonder what purpose the elves originally built it for.

You would need a dynamic dns forwarder on the machine that's on the public (no-ip.com, one of those) and then a VPN back to the internal Network, unless you open a specific firewall port that's expecting something redirected from dynamic dns, but I'm not even sure that latter part is possible.

He was accused of rape by multiple women.  Majority of the women recanted.  Main accuser could not keep a coherent and consistent story.  However, if you are charged not guilty doesn't that mean you are innocent?  I personally don't believe either. I want the case settled and facts and evidence to be brought forward. There are people out there that can lie extremely well, from both sides. Believing "victims" is the reason a 14 yr old African American (Emmet Till)  in the 50's was murdered. Granted, that was sexual assault. Not quite the same thing. But the point stands, if you believe a good liar in the court of public opinion you can cause someone's death due to your irresponsibility. The problem is more cases are coming out where the accuser is lying.  There are psychopaths out there as well as rapists. Both should be prosecuted and treated like the criminals they are.
Thanks!

Massive velocity problems. Please help.  I have a remington sendaro II/ 300 win mag.   The load is Sierra match-king HPBT 175gr. Powder- 72.5 gr of IMR 4831. Norma brass. Federal 215M primers.   I have seen massive velocity shifts with this round and I just can‚Äôt figure out what the problem is. At 600 yards I have a 1.7 mil shift at a 40 degree temperature change. At 1000 yards it‚Äôs a massive 5.2 mil shift at only a 60 degrees in temperature change.   When I put this data into a calculator it‚Äôs says I have an almost 700 FPS change in velocity. I doubt that‚Äôs right though.   The rounds are exposed to outside temperature but are kept in a box so no sun. There are some elevation shift when I collect data but I doubt that the problem.   I‚Äôm using a RCBS charge master 1500 the powder is the same every time.  Is this normal? Has anyone had this problem before? If so what where some solutions? Can you predict velocity changes with change is powder temp?

Apparently you've never heard of corporations who retain sovereignty over themselves while making agreements with other corporations that help them achieve their respective goals.   Anarchists do the same with each other within a framework of mutual aid whose aim is to maximize the wellbeing of all. They can scale to any size by linking communes.   Like I said, you need to learn about socialism.
This is what happens when you get conservative too early. Your defense gets tired.

Nice whataboutism there.  It still doesn't beat the fact that places like Buckingham Palace and St. Peter's Basilica are part of the heritage of mankind, and have hosted some of the greatest people in human history, whereas the republican palaces in Ukraine and Saddam's palaces added nothing to the heritage of those countries and were just buildings full of tacky wealth meant to be plundered.  You *know* there is a wide difference between, say, the portions of St. Peter's Basilica that were created and overseen by *Michelangelo* during the Italian Renaissance, and Viktor Yanukovich's infamous *Mezhyhirya* residence that featured no less than 35 cars, 7 motorbikes, a petting zoo that featured ostriches, a boat, chandeliers that cost no less than 100k and a roof made of pure copper...oh, and a 42 million dollar order for opulent light fixtures.  All of that in a republic with a significant amount of people living below the poverty line.   Point is, if you're going to attack monarchs and popes in a shitty case of that "whataboutism" Reddit seems hellbent on monitoring, you may as well focus *your* blind eye on the corrupt politicians that voters never seem to much about despite their imagined ownership over them.
I feel like the John Smith ballsy 4th down play never works when it matters.
Good time to be a Furry.
in AoE2 the shield is irrelevant. What counts is the ranged armor plus the walking speed, which isn't great. Also they cost only 20 gold compared to 50 of archers but that's still gold you're wasting.  In the feudal age men at arms are strictly reserved for a superearly rush before the other guy starts spamming archers. If they already have archers, you've just wasted precious villager-seconds on a useless rush.

You probably learned to touch your sister when your uncle touched you in the woods next to the trailer park.
He jumps off both feet at the same time, so it‚Äôs not a travel. You can pick up your pivot foot if the other foot has also left the ground, you just have to pass or shoot before you land.

&gt; It‚Äôs a line with defined endpoints  No.  You're defining the endpoints.  And you're ignoring the huge amount of people that think the Democratic party isnt different enough from the Republican party and say they wont vote because:  &gt;Both sides are the same.  I dont know why you're writing them off, but you keep insisting they're all somewhere between the Republican and Democratic parties.  I'm sorry I cant put it in a way that you're able to understand, maybe someone else can.
This is the way
For 13 bucks, I would go with Ultegra. I run both and the is a noticeable difference clipping in and out, sharper and crisp but pedaling is no different. In wouldn't spend the extra if they were regular MSRP.
Yes, that's what I meant. Since swc doesn't support them either, it's probably for the same reason.

The way this was handled is a bit disappointing. The communication was so delayed . Tireless hours spent troubleshooting . When I know Dexcom has my email and could have kicked out a system wide email IMMEDIATELY . Very poorly executed communications in that regard .  Or even having its automated system leave a phone message . ‚ÄúCustomers may be experiencing issues with the application ‚Äú. Etc. like does Dexcom Not have these measures in place to communicate ?  Also as a server administrator I am Honestly just surprised how these servers don‚Äôt have redundancy to the point that their time to restoration would be this long ????   Their servers have never had issues that would require their Contingency servers to resume business continuity ???
My feeling says that this years year crossing event will not be a society event, but will be a zodiac general event. We are getting our 6th general so we are halfway there so it would be a very good good time to give us some background story about the generals and what their actual roll is and what the reason behind selecting each maiden is. This could be why they delay kumbhiras costume.

I hate to be 'that guy' but it is possible (even likely) that she's using her mental health as an excuse to break up. Maybe she just wasn't feeling it.maybe she wants to date other people. And that's OK.   Like they say, if you love someone, let them go. Doesn't mean you're not an extraordinary person. There are tutorials and subs with tips to deal with break ups. These are really hard times. Be kind to yourself. My number one tip is to (for now) erase this person from your life completely. Put all the pictures in a folder where you don't see it, all the memories Ina shoebox under the bed. Go No Contact - for your own mental health and we'll being. Meet people. Take care of yourself ( a light jog for 10 minutes 3 time a week is enough to get incredible mental health benefits from it). Stay away from alcohol and caffeine. Take care for your mental health, meditate, breathe. Meet friends, get hobbies, keep your mind busy. Work on being happy and confident, and people will FLOCK to you!

Man this whole post has so many beautiful replies! I particularly love your line that abuse is so much more than deciding who‚Äôs guilty and being deeper than the relationship. It‚Äôs so so true.   And I think it also helps me to understand my reactions to his abuse went deeper than him and touched on my own past pain and trauma.  I always feel so torn about everything. I hate what he did to me but I know he is in more pain than I ever could imagine. I‚Äôm still angry sometimes but I mostly feel helpless and immense sadness - I think these people are capable of great love and happiness if they just found the strength to heal.

Every time you extend a component, you‚Äôre doing object oriented programming. Whether or not it‚Äôs prototypical or classical, you are still creating a generic template from which instances can be made. Whenever you have an instance and can use this to refer to that instance, you‚Äôre doing OOP.
I did [this](https://www.sprachenzentrum.hu-berlin.de/en/courses-and-registration/hu-gla/summer-module-1) four-week course at Humboldt Universit√§t zu Berlin, it was perfect for me. Really challenged my German just enough but I still learned way better than I‚Äôve ever with a language. Really affordable, and Berlin is an outstanding city :)  They also test your level at the start of the course, so you can sign up for whatever level you think you‚Äôre at, but you‚Äôll be placed in the proper level anyway.

I would love to buy that Bane from the animated series!
 Thanks for the questions!  1) put the expected in the hold clearance as a separate flight plan #2 so you could quickly do a direct to and then pull up the approach?   I didn‚Äôt know what my amended clearance was in the hold. When the further clearance did not come at or after the EFC time, I could not remember where I was cleared to (or technically where I was expecting a clearance to). I was not told (despite asking) what the diversion for the flight would be before the flight. Once I decided that most likely I was given ‚ÄúExpect Lebanon‚Äù, then I put M02 in the GPS and proceeded direct to an initial approach fix.   2) Would you have done a radio trouble shoot scenario like on/off, change headsets/plugs, fuses, com2, handheld radio? Pull out the checklist and see if there is a radio troubleshooting on it? Do a 7600 on the squawk? Keep talking on the radio even though you are not sure they can hear?   Yes, I did a radio troubleshoot. I think that it would be a red flag for the DPE if an applicant did not troubleshoot. Moreover, I was PRAYING that at some point in the troubleshoot the DPE would start responding as ATC again. Yes pretend squawk 7600. Your point on continued (pretend) radio calls was something I could have been better at. Once I got to the initial approach fixed, the DPE said that the unicom frequency was fine so I made all of those calls.   3) did the DPE give you planned fix times to leave the hold and perform the approach?   Just the EFC time on the hold. I left this late - reasoning it was better to stay in the hold and figure out where I was going rather than start roaming the sky haha.
What kind of stuff did you experience?  I played Rocket League for a long time and I never really had any super unpleasant players. There were a couple that were kinda unpleasant but for the most part the people were cool.
WOOOOO! Nice one fam! Congratulations!
I know this sounds silly but ive had problems with every vga compatible monitor with game systems. Its like they just werent designed with game systems in mind. Even if the resolution can be accepted by the monitor something about the signal just doesnt click with it. So incase it just wont work, that could be why
That probably looks better l, it's real fire
Yeah I noticed this too. Thankfully the Overcharge still makes sound so you can go off of that to know where he is.
What do you plan on using it for?  What did you mean the compressor you tried didn‚Äôt work?  The TC is a generic model air compressor - iirc that‚Äôs the one without a tank. The primary problem you‚Äôll run into here is if you‚Äôre spraying for extended periods of time you can end up with the airbrush sputtering a bit, as you have no reservoir to run on the compressor has to keep up with your air needs in real time, and that‚Äôs not always possible  Obviously it‚Äôs more convenient to use a compressor with a tank so you don‚Äôt have that problem - and you get an added benefit of the compressor not running all the time  However - there are some things you can do to make the issue negligible. First I‚Äôd recommend getting a really long air hose if you can. A long hose can act like a pseudo reservoir for you to work from, and the length of hose will give your compressor time to catch up with air demand. Second thing I‚Äôd recommend would be to try and spray in spurts - that way you‚Äôre economical with your air and won‚Äôt run into as many issues

&gt; This should be the standard of religious studies tbh.  There shouldn't be religious studies in schools.   There should be a history of religions, talking about   * the many religions that existed and no longer survive,   * how current day religions expanded (via conquest, which means murder, pillage and rape),   * how they often incorporated parts of the religions they replaced (halloween and christmas are an example for christianity - I don't remember the part where jesus talks about putting up a tree in december and hanging colorful glass orbs in it),   * how many religions there still are and how different their takes on creation, gods etc,   * how each religion is clearly inspired by the environment of the people that started it,   * how religious rules have their basis in common sense rules - common sense at a time with no refrigeration, no modern medicine etc.

Same.  I think it was a great experience for me.  Tbf my family did try public education, but it didn't work out. There's so much "I knew one weirdo homeschooler" in this post's chat and it pisses me off.  I'm not going to defend being shut in all day or being unschooled, but for some people homeschooling is a good option.
Burpee to putting your feet on an ab dolly, knee tuck, then palms to elbows and try to get up without dying.
Thats nothing too complicated. I mean, if a 16 year old human can give you a detailed plan of how to drive a co-worker into the worst kind of madness imaginable, I think it shouldn't be too hard for someone who studied humans to make an even better plan

Look for an older (even over a decade old) laser printer. I managed to get a free Brother HL4050CDN on GumTree. The screen has been snapped off and there was no toner included, but I don't need the screen (it runs a HTTP server where you can see the same info), and I just bought some new toner. It works flawlessly and the colour prints are really good, and the black is sharper than any inkjet I've ever used. And the toner is good for &gt;2000 pages. Not to mention it can natively print on both sides of the paper and can print quite fast. It was 12 years old and free, but it works better than inkjets in *every* way. The only negatives are that it weighs ~30kg and is very large, but you can easily find smaller models.

Is it really so bad that someone forgot that the second biggest holiday in their country isn‚Äôt celebrated worldwide? Like come on, anything anyone says that‚Äôs slightly off color or taken out of context is blown up in this sub and all comments are weird anti-America shit. Ya, our president is horrible and a few old people in Alabama are racist. Why try to make us look so bad? I‚Äôm sure if any other country had the same influence and power as the US, there would subs like this just for them. We aren‚Äôt all horrible people, in fact 90% of us aren‚Äôt. Imagine how it would feel being a regular American who is tolerant and educated and has their own independent thoughts, and seeing this shit hole of a sub just shitting on your country every chance they get. Like where do you guys get off? Does it make you feel like your country is better in some way?
Id rather have Hightower Collins and Van Noy
You are doing your part in killing white europe. Meanwhile, africans couldn't give two shits about giving up their teenage lifestyle to start a family and have 6 children. People like you are the reason why "the great replacement" is happening...  Edit: before you call me a nazi. I just want to say that im not. Im just a liberal-conservative who is genuenly concerned with society and progressivism. Im a firm beliver in the nuclear family and traditional family values. I just think that the whole r/childfree stuff is degeneracy.
Well that's part of it, it's part of the decrease in birthrates. But I think cultural revival comes first and that will keep liberalism in check in moderation.
It's interesting that you cite an article from a site that specifically targets pits. Care to find a less blatantly biased site?

There are a lot of people who just don't pay attention to politics but like the ideas of patriotism, family values, and whatnot since they sound good and are vague enough to mean anything. As such they support whatever politician claims such since they don't know enough about the actual positions to know what they are actually supporting.

Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:  1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed. 2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person. 3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Okay, so Damascus steel used Wootz ore, and when it ran out the art died within a generation. A few years ago, scientists examined Damascus steel items and found carbon nanotubes in them. How did they get there? Eh, who knows.  Modern damascus steel is pattern-welding. It's where you layer different steels and fold them. You can do this with various goals in mind. With the right composition, pattern, and heat treatment, you can for example get a blade with a very hard edge, but which can nevertheless yield without breaking. This was super handy before modern alloys.  These days it's pretty universally made to look pretty. Don't expect it make the blade any better. In fact, there's a good chance you'll get a blade that dulls as if it were stainless yet rusts like it was carbon. On the upside, it does look super sweet.  Some original Damascus steel items were pattern-welded, but far from all of them.
It's so silent sometimes, it's even invisible.

It was the alternator. I guess it was slowly dying, and the normal voltage across the battery with the lights off, and car running, didn't last but a couple days. The alternator stopped charging regardless 2 days later.  I got it replaced for just labor costs, which were 80 dollars. All in all, cheapest repair I've ever had.

The best manager I‚Äôve ever have is the one I have now. I think what makes her awesome is that she can do and does do every part of the job that I do. Some supervisors think they are ‚Äúabove‚Äù doing the work that their employees do. She also gives us recognition for what we do, which is direct support. I‚Äôve had other bosses that expect way too much without any kind of praise and it‚Äôs disheartening. It‚Äôs nice to be recognized occasionally!

This type of an approach is present on multiple fronts from my experience so far. I found that unless one is the most basic user and uses TN just like an e-mail for direct communication, there are better e-mail services.  In my recent Liebesbrief to Tutanota I found out a number of my issues with TN is not present in ProtonMail, so I have made my decision that while I am a fan of TN, I need an e-mail, which will not limit me and PM is a better option right now (while TN team throws promises all around, the worst problem with TN is a timeline - you never know if that one thing you are waiting for will arrive tomorrow or 3 years later), having especially better maintenance tools - a galaxy away better inbox rules management and folders and flags + option to disable notifications for some folders (super useful for Newsletter/Promos)...oh, and I am not even mentioning that TN is missing and so far unsuccessfully implementing Conversation view feature which in 8 days will officially become 5 years old suggestion, they say it will come in 2020, but 3 years it was already too late IMO.

I like this because it adds tremendous depth, and equality, to the film.   The entire story is about him working his way through her baggage to have a happy, healthy relationship with her.   However, the idea of "conquering" makes it seem very one-sided, like he's saving her, but this detail reminds us that it's a two way street. He has baggage too, and he has to overcome it as well - and they can, and should, handle it together.   We could easily imagine a sequel told of the same relationship from her perspective.

Hey! Everyone here are making great points. The gist of it is stick up for yourself! Your mom will simply have to get over herself when you say no. It will get easier the more you say it for both of you and she will hopefully just stop asking one day altogether. Your donations and volunteering shouldn't be your relationship with her anyway.  It would be a good idea to talk to a professional. I had to as a teen/young adult and it didn't take long before i started getting comfortable talking to someone. A few months and you can really help yourself build some real confidence in yourself. Your already an awesome person! You've had a crazy life and just need a push =)

I think [Lindsay Ellis](https://twitter.com/thelindsayellis?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) somewhat addressed this in her GoT video. (Though some people here tend to misinterpret Lindsay's criticisms in a very far fetch manner.)  Regardless. I'm not sure what you are getting at. Are you asking if we agree that experiencing hardships can make you a stronger person? Or are you asking if we agree Sansa was made a 'strong woman' by the hardships she endured?  If it's the former, then yes, defiantly overcoming hardships can make you a stronger person. Though it can also break you and leave you in pieces.   That being said, I'm not entirely convinced Sansa actually is a 'Strong woman'.  We are constantly told that she is, but her being 'strong' pretty much consists of being a massive bitch to the one person who ensured her survival and jeopardized everything to help her.  Dany actually is a 'Strong woman' (before she got lobotomized in season 7,8) and she definitely is as strong as she at least in part because of the hardships she endured.(As she likes to remind us)  The difference is that the hardships Dany endured didn't strip her of her emotions and her compassion. She fought for the weak and the helpless even though it was detrimental to her war efforts. It seems Sansa only thinks about herself. She isn't 'Strong' she'd just a bitch. That's too bad though, she wasn't like this always. Back when she was with Joffrey and took risks to help the drunk knight. Or point out she saw Joffrey cry when he mocked Tommen for crying. Then she was strong.

This is not a debate around diplomatic immunity and its values and shortcomings.  The point here is that a family member of someone working on behalf of the US government shouldn't receive full protection under it for an act such as murder or manslaughter, nor should the US government not comply with the UK government and their expressed wishes to have her not be extradited so that they can face questioning where the crime took place.  This was linked earlier in the thread;  [https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-update-to-parliament-on-harry-dunn-case](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretary-update-to-parliament-on-harry-dunn-case)  To enable the police investigation to follow its proper course, on 5 September, the FCO formally requested the US Embassy to waive immunity. Given the seriousness of the incident, our view was -and remains - that justice needs to be done.  If her immunity had been waived, Northamptonshire Police would then have been able to compel her to cooperate fully with their investigation.  However, on 13 September, the FCO was informed by the US Embassy that they would not waive immunity, and that the individual would be leaving the country imminently, unless the UK had strong objections.  We duly and immediately objected in clear and strong terms and have done since. Nevertheless, under the Vienna Convention, UK police could not have lawfully prevented the individual from leaving the UK.  When the FCO followed up with the US Embassy on 16 September, they informed us that the individual had departed the day before.

Surely it depends entirely on how much you earn. If you you are in a minimum wage job than 3-months wage is probably buy you a extremely nice ring.  If you're not in a minimum wage job then 3 months would probably buy an extremely expensive ring, but it would be just as nice.   As a very general rule I refused to spend more than about $500 on anything that doesn't have a processor. Even if it doesn't make sense for it to have one, for $500 they can stick one in.

The first thing about a good fitter is finding someone is not incentivized by how much they end up selling you.  However if they are not making a commission off the sale, they will need to charge for the fitting session to make their time worth while.

Went into the store to try and get more info on this offer that is in the Black Friday section of the bell promotions page. If you click the learn more link it redirects to the iPhone XR page. Reps in the bell store told me they could not honour it since they did not know about it, they told me to phone Bell. Phone rep told me they did not see it on the site (but got awfully quiet after I described/directed to them where it was on the page). Could this be a real offer? Or is it just another misprint. The offer has been listed on the promotions page since at least Tuesday.

If the transportation was solar or clean in someway, the weight wouldnt matter when it comes to environmental costs incurred via transpo.  regardless, A study by Coca Cola that they did before they decided to switch from glass to plastic bottles showed that glass, including the transpo environmental costs, is the most environmentally friendly material provided that the glass bottle is reused a min of 12 times. Its available to learn about in this doc: https://m.dw.com/en/plastic-tide/av-50496457
I actually think that microglitters last longer because the glitters stick to your nail due to their heaviness. The  brand's formula may just not play well with your body chemistry.  Additionally, you have to consider that body chemistry impacts topcoat durability and basecoat effectiveness. It takes a lot of experimenting to see what works best on you, more so than with perfume because there are so many products you have to use for polish.

Appreciate the kind words, /u/BrayKitUp.  I was torn whether I should tell OP (/u/hoshner08) that ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù is the only game I‚Äôve platinumed in as long as I can remember, and that while I have yet to finish ‚ÄúGod of War‚Äù, ‚ÄúUncharted 4‚Äù, ‚ÄúControl‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays Gone‚Äù, ‚ÄúRed Dead Redemption 2‚Äù, and many others yet... I couldn‚Äôt put ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù down.  The base game is great and whether you like the DLC or not is just icing on the cake.  I absolutely loved the traversal and while I was suffering from open world fatigue, I didn‚Äôt feel like this was a traditional, open world game due to the speed and finesse of the traversal system and the fluid combat felt  more like playing with your toys than going through the motions.  *****  But ultimately, I don‚Äôt know how OP feels about open world games.  I don‚Äôt know how they feel about ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù games, or him as a character.  I don‚Äôt know if they like the ‚ÄúArkham‚Äù or ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù style combat.  I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre looking for something that‚Äôs more action, or narrative oriented.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a perfect game either, but what it does, it does well.  /r/PS4 is overwhelmingly gonna tell you it‚Äôs perfect, though.  It‚Äôs a very strong foundation for them to build on for the next game, however.  And I don‚Äôt feel in any way that my time was wasted by playing it, though I‚Äôve not completed all of the DLC yet.  - **The only thing I know is that it felt like OP gave a false choice between ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù ‚Äî one of the best reviewed and most beloved games on Reddit of it‚Äôs year; a complete game with DLC if you want more of it... and the ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù game ‚Äî a title that doesn‚Äôt even come out until May 2020**.  It just seemed like such a ridiculous choice of a post and I‚Äôm not even sure they‚Äôre not trolling.  The fact that the body of their post is 7 words long and wants us to decide between a game that none of us have even played and won‚Äôt come out for another **half a year** is ridiculous, and I‚Äôm honestly surprised this post has 600+ upvotes.  But yeah, /r/PS4 likes ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù, haha.  Anyone that says otherwise is likely to be downvoted.  Sadly, there‚Äôs no downloadable demo for the game that I‚Äôm aware of, so I stand by my statement that you‚Äôre better off looking up reviews from critics whose views you most closely align with, so you know that their taste is similar to yours.  And watch some gameplay to see if it looks like it would be fun to you.  We‚Äôre a ***LONG*** way off from ‚ÄúThe Avengers‚Äù and the jury is still out on that one and will be for some time.  So you‚Äôd have plenty of time to platinum ‚ÄúSpider-Man‚Äù if you so choose over the next six months and pick up ‚ÄúAvengers‚Äù if it catches your fancy later on.  Happy gaming to you!
Hi again! Hope you are doing well!  I'm at the Indigo Plateau and I feel like I'm a *bit* underleveled for now  My party is:   lvl 65 Venusaur with Strength, Razor Leaf, Giga Drain and Frenzy Plant  lvl 40 Persian with Shadow Ball, Bite, Faint Attack and Return  lvl 43 Kabutops with Rock Slide, Rock Smash, Cut and Absorb(that I plan to swap for a second rock type move, probably Ancient Power after level 65)  lvl 41 Exeggutor with Psychic, Solar Beam, Confusion and Stun Spore  lvl 37 Lapras with Surf, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam and Blizzard  lvl 40 Gyarados with Surf, Rain Dance, Hydro Pump and Thunder  And my question is, what level should they all be? And where should I use the VS Seeker for the best outcome? I usually grind bikers outside of the Celadon City but they are kinda low leveled now.

Lesbians have been expressing concern over this for a long time only to be ignored and not listened to.  You can find blogs from 2012...sadly some were removed by wordpress for you guessed it..."transphobia."  It was mostly lesbians on the receiving end of violent threats.  The LGBT ignored.  Two lesbians were killed by Dana Rivers (trans) and Dana also murdered their adopted son.  The LGBT couldn't even be bothered to memoralize the couple that were murdered by Dana because it didn't fit the narrative that trans just wanna pee.  The LGBT swept it under the rug.  Here are the many threats that have been going on for years...mostly aimed at lesbians.

Hello All,  I ended up getting a code for free with a game purchase today. Figured I would share it for the first person to claim it since I didn‚Äôt need it.
I‚Äôll take 1 order, hold the trophies.
Taylor nods in understanding. ‚ÄúOh, yeah, that can be terrifying. But hey- you won‚Äôt have to deal with any monsters here, there‚Äôs a barrier that stops them getting in.‚Äù  ...Usually. But all those times it happened anyway don‚Äôt count!  ‚ÄúThe only ones that *are* in Camp stay in the forest,‚Äù she continues. Perhaps not the most comforting fact but it would hopefully stave off any sense of betrayal when Isabel later realises there *are* some monsters here. ‚ÄúSo they can‚Äôt get at you.‚Äù
Nice! I've practiced a little with knives, I really love them, but I'm not great with them yet lol. Very nice work tho!!
Okay.
Sorry I took so long to respond.  Yes, I get where you are coming from. As long as y'all don't have to go out of your way, I'd let it happen, and just keep an eye on things.
I don't actually
Why did she act creeped out when he commented about the outfit, she knows what she streams lmao. Don't worry fellow hogsqueezer I got your back bro
Let's go find Chase Young financial records! /s
Nsfw!
think of it this way, god forbid if anything were to happen to you, who will take the baby? if your gf doesn't adopt your daughter she could loose the baby that she loves and cares for like a mother and your daughter looses the only mother she has ever known. adoption is an easy way to fix this issue but if that doesn't work for you I suggest that you see a lawyer and get papers making your gf her guardian should you die.
My Myers-Briggs result changes a lot depending on my mood. I am extroverted, and a generally bubbly excitable person who can fit in with most people. I have no interest in being like everyone else, but without significant people in my life I feel a bit empty and lost. However, I can still enjoy time spent by myself. I am prone to bouts of sadness that don‚Äôt last long, but am generally very happy and content in the little things. I am insecure about my loved ones and sincere relationships make me worried and I dread what will happen after ‚Äúthe honeymoon phase‚Äù. I resent others telling me who or what I am, which can make me argumentative and unsure of myself. My personality changes a little depending on my mood and my peers. I have anxiety about sleeping and darkness, and am very immature in some aspects of myself. By immature I mean giggly and mischievous, and delighting in childish things, because I never really grew out of finding joy and wonder in the world. (I‚Äôm 15) I can‚Äôt deal with fake people who aren‚Äôt sincere and honest. I am very empathetic which often causes me a lot of pain for someone else‚Äôs sake. I generally am very open and flexible but when someone crosses boundaries I can be very fierce. I am often violent and lash out as a habit. I am philosophical which can make me lose hope for a while. My most recent Myers Brigg is ENFP-T. My hogwarts house is slytherin. Hope this helps!
In all seriousness though, I don‚Äôt see it coming to Alabama anytime soon as bad as I wish it would.
Yeah you might be right. I see your day counter there, what did you end up doing if you don't mind me asking?
There's a video of this on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99k2r6GeS4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q99k2r6GeS4)).  It is rather harrowing so only watch if you have a strong stomach.

Man don‚Äôt you love it when you attack a sovereign nation, then bully the populace so bad your military has to worry about people putting bombs in all manner of things?
why would you want to have a say in this? I mean, if it is not for you then it's not your business, if it is then either be thankful for the gift or tell them you don't need it but don't complain on it especially because it is not covering a purpose that you actually need and you cannot realistically introduce a cheaper option.  of course unless you want the device for a defendable purpose that is not video games, in this case you can probably put together a basic build with and A-series APU with 4G RAM in a cheap A320 motherboard in a similar price range or get a second-hand office PC or older workstation.
Except that PGI have stated that they have coded it in such a way that turning the Co-op Mode in to PVP via modding 'should' be impossible.   I for one, believe that our modders are better than that and will be able to make it happen.

"From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs."  Does this sound like your idea of "equity"? You would be forgiven if you didn't realize that this was the philosophy of the Bolshevik Soviet regime.  Do you remember what happened to the last bunch of people who wanted to live "equitably"? 50-100 million people had to die so that Communist countries could be equitable.  Humans are animals too. If you create a political system which breaks the natural laws governing human interaction, many millions of people will die, and everyone will be miserable.

THIS! Quick cool once the solids reach the level of toasted you want. I have a stainless bowl filled with ice water standing by to set the bottom of the saucepan into as soon as it's done.

I've been playing for almost two years, so it took about that long! I wasn't working on decomposing too seriously when I first started though, so I imagine it could be done much more quickly.   I decomposed as many 4 and 5 star items as I could because those fill up up the Lost Casket more quickly. Farmed a lot of maiden 7-7, and purchased 100 pulls in the mystery pavilion. It's a suit that just takes time though!
Yes. Look at QBs who played 15 years. How many of them were runners? I say this as somebody who loves Cam. I loved Cunningham and McNabb. Runners tend to get beat up.  Now, in turn, please show me the data that shows the running QBs playing to their late 30s or 40s like Ben, Peyton, Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Philip Rivers.

Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee! and Sword/Shield:  1. Avoid PM trading. Most scammers place other users in private situations to avoid having their actions seen in public. Also, note that for your trade to count for flair, every part of the conversation should be public so that all details can be confirmed. 2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner is using, it is important that you double check that you are trading with the right person. 3. If you are trading shiny Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the [full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report it so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.   *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I've got a 1070, which still holds up for now and is bottle necked by the CPU it seems. I'll likely upgrade the gpu within the next 6 months after this upgrade. I was hoping to snag the AMD chip at a discount this upcoming Monday (Cyber Monday), as the 9900k seems to be between $400-500usd maybe it'd be the same for the amd set. You're right though, I'm just trying to nit-pick performance haha

Checkout the bikeexchange.com many people are moving up on the tier of entry level to intermediate to advanced to pro. There‚Äôs plenty of good options out there that might be more economical than buying straight new. You can also part hoard like I am right now. I picked up a specialized allez sport frame for about $140 and will pair with Shimano 105, Chinese‚Äôs bars, headset, and seat post rolling on some Shimano WH-6700s. Right now I‚Äôm at $890 so the price of an entry road bike with far better parts.  Edit; should have mentioned that if I bought everything at full price the build is at $1,900.

In *Battle Angel Alita: Last Order*, there is a rumor or urban legend that Mars was colonized by Nazis and Japanese after World War II. Alita's original name is a Japanese one, and her childhood friend Erica seems to be German. Also, Alita practices the Martian martial art of Panzer Kunst, which has a German name. Venus and Jupiter were colonized later.

This is pretty much the exact look I am going for as well. Instead of a whole dress I decided on separates. I just ordered my lace top (went with a crop top, but I was contemplating a body suit)  and plan on ordering a tulle skirt from Etsy. When I priced it out it was much cheaper to do separates.

I played pretty competitive MTG for a bit in high school. Won a juniors super series and got a few top 8s at PTQ events. Was playing in one once, and a pro I followed a lot was at the same event, I was even playing a deck he used. Black deck with red splashed just for Flametongue Kavu. On the forums he had a reputation for not having great hygiene. At one point he was seated at the table in front of me, and he was wearing these grey sweats, and had a line of ass-sweat that was growing throughout the event and due to his pant selection was incredibly visible. I actually made the top 8, and when we were drawing for spots for the Draft format, I was hoping I wouldn't have to sit near him, which really sucked, cause at the time this guy was literally my favorite player.
2 ladies come in, seated, drinks served. They're chit chatting, taking their time. That's fine, they're old friends who haven't seen each other in a while.  I come back, "are we ready to order ladies?" "oh no lmfao we haven't even looked at the menu" and they both pick up the menu. "no worries, I'll come back in a minute."  Repeat 3 or 4 times over the next 20 minutes, all of us getting increasingly annoyed. Like seriously, you make the motions of opening the menu do you just set it back down and keep chatting as soon as I walk away? Place your order so we can both get out of each other's hair.  I had another guy where getting him to order his lunch was like pushing a mule up hill. When he finally decides he wants the chicken fajitas, I ask him if he wants corn or flour tortillas and I might as well have asked him if he wanted to donate his left or right nut. He was completely incapable of making decisions, I dunno how he managed to get socks and shoes on that morning.

It does taste like meat. The lunch spot across the street from my office added it a few months ago. I ordered it thinking Impossible Burger was just the name of the burger. (They name their sandwiches things like that) I ate it and didnt notice it wasn't meat. A few days later the counter girl asked me if I liked it and it was only then I realized it wasn't beef.
This is all over the place.  The fact that he didn't tell you that he was going to file for custody is alarming. Do you live together? If you do, that is double alarming. He would just show up with this other kid, like it wasn't a big deal. I do see your side. HOWEVER, I can also see his side in wanting to help the sibling of his older kids. Its commendable.  You guys definitely need to have a conversation. You need to express how concerning to you it is that he didn't even talk to you about this before he acted.
Yes you‚Äôre right only a small percentage of players are actually on Reddit.  If they are aware of it they should make an effort to fix it.  They probably consider it a low priority unfortunately, and have it placed near the end of the list.

Well I mean yeah but I was referring to mainly the pure 1v1 sword-fighting mechanics, of course D doesn‚Äôt have everything else you mentioned because it‚Äôs a different game.  But with the way you can parry with good timing, how there‚Äôs clinches, how sword-fighting feels quick and deadly, how the hit detection and health system isn‚Äôt broken; the base mechanics are there in the Dishonored engine to make a kick-ass DMoMMaM game.

Presidente Andino has relayed his response to the Chinese Embassy in Havana, stating that the relationship between the CPC and the CCP is unshakable. The Cuban revolution will always accept the much needed aid from our socialist allies, as times have been difficult for Cuba since the fall of the Soviet Union. The CPC has begun putting together a list of proposals that will draw the two nations closer in the near future, and will be relayed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs when finished.   After significant debate about the permanent PLAN base establishment, the CPC has declined at this time. The proposed base would be too close to the illegally-held Guantanamo Bay by the American forces, and managing Detente has been difficult enough for Cuba over the years, the CPC does not seek to escalate the situation any further.   However, Cuba is willing to construct a PLAAF and PLA joint base in Cuba on the opposite side of the island in Pinar Del Rio. The base should not exceed 2,000 personnel at any point in time. The land the base resides on will remain the property of the Communist Party of Cuba, non-negotiable, however will allow the Chinese to conduct operations in LATAM. In exchange, the CPC requests that the PLA forces commit to the continued training and development of the Revolutionary Armed Forces. The Revolutionary Navy operates one of its primary Naval Bases in Cienfuegos that recently underwent a massive upgrade to house specifically Chinese naval ships, as that is what the Revolutionary Navy operates, and would be able to temporarily house, refuel, repair the PLAN and act as leave rotations for up to three months per vessel at a time. This will allow the PLAN to have an access port to LATAM without having to make long resource commitments. The base, of course, belongs to the Cuban proletariat and will remain so, the Chinese are our guests.

IIRC matching is on Monday  You will receive an email stating your match is ready, and then you go from there.  People getting shafted by their Santas happens but the % is quite low.  I wouldn't worry to much. Just follow the steps and you should be fine. My advice is to *always* provide shipping proof, just in case the package gets lost and your giftee has to report "No Gift". Providing shipping proof will help you not get banned.  Secret Santa is amazing and fun, I wouldn't worry too much about it!

Ditto for pencil skirts which have the added bonus of being really uncomfortable.
Honestly dude, I'm the same way. For example I love how he actually made opioid addiction a national health crisis. Granted there hasn't been much done after that but it was big of him to do that. I really do look at each topic and how it affects me, and then how or affects other. Like I try to put myself in their shoes. If I'd feel like shit, then I don't support the topic.

I don't know if reporters intentionally have Canadian accents, but Canadians definitely do have accents. There's the Newfies of course, but the other maritime provinces sound different. Then there's Ontario. It's a bit more subtle. Quebec definitely has accents as noticeable as Newfoundland. In Western Canada you will notice it as well. The natives (and whoever else) who grew up up on the reservations do sound different than, say those who grew up in Calgary. They sound stereotypically Canadian. And for what it's worth, a professional would not go to a country to start talking in their accents. I have met a lot of people from the UK who have lived in Canada for years, and years and still have their accents. It's just not cost effective. What would more likely.be the case (if the news agency  actually wants the reporters to sound Canadian) is that they get a voice coach, no different than what they would do for the movies.

also, Clinton needed 43 votes to get to 270. PA has 20 EC votes, Michigan has 16 EC votes, and Wisconsin has 10 EC votes.  46 votes would have taken Clinton above 270, and would have put Trump below 270. Clinton would have won with those three states, and she lost those states by about 70k.   Michigan was 10704, pa was 44292, and Wisconsin was 22748, 77744 votes
Exactly! We are so normal to see her in photos that we forgot how really big she is!!
They both knew of each other‚Äôs situations.
I didn't mention space... GSK are a drugs company so they certainly aren't doing anything space-related either lol.
I don't think so! I was delivering packages to the Veteran Porter, walked into the BT area and saw them there. I guess the game spawned them in or something.

My recommendation is just use the kit lens for a while. Then, spreadsheet your favorite photos, using the EXIF to see your favorite focal lengths. Then just pick the prime that matches said focal length. I‚Äôve used a prime 35mm in film, so I ended up picking the 23mm f2 (35 FF).

Ugh....
&gt;  that mastery system is based on the one from smite and smite Is a moba just like League.  I know very little about smite. But I played Paladins a bit and quite enjoyed it (Honestly believe it's more fun than Overwatch, but not as good game design wise)   I'll look into smites application of this.

When you say "the technical ability of the transducers", is this a way of saying how well they can handle EQ without introducing distortion? Sorry I'm not too up on the technical terms.

You don't get it. It isn't losing to it that is unfun, it's playing against it at all. The motions of beating projectile spam is painfully unfun for a lot of people
Is that not how it works? Because I have never seen any evidence to the contrary.

She didn't flee the country. She was recalled by the embassy.  Edit:  https://www.npr.org/2019/10/07/768032889/british-prime-minister-urges-u-s-to-waive-immunity-for-woman-after-deadly-car-cr?t=1575189229893  "She flew out on diplomatic immunity"  The only way to for one to fly out on diplomatic immunity is if the embassy plane takes you in and out. More on that later.  And  https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-49945461  "The problem here is that the US do not appear to have granted a waiver for this particular diplomatic spouse.   Instead, they have removed her from the UK before the British government could threaten to remove her itself if she did not submit to questioning."   And:   "The mother of three, who is in hiding in America after flying home on a state-sponsored private jet, said she was 'terribly, terribly sorry for that tragic mistake'."   https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7573341/Diplomats-wife-Anne-Sacoolas-breaks-silence-fireball-crash-killed-Brit-Harry-Dunn.html   You can't flee on a state sponsored private jet. That's the embassy footing the bill, that's you being recalled.

You gain points for good performance and lose points for bad, you have point based matchmaking and respective divisions, highest tier qualifies you to play in exclusive tournaments.  Thats literally what a ranked mode is, is arena a good and refined mode? Definitely not, but it still is one.
Ehhh, okay. Got out of a two year relationship last weekend, and am trying to find myself currently.
