C'est le même combat mais ça ne fait pas de mal de rappeler que pas mal de gens en ont strictement rien à foutre de ce combat tant que les violences restent cantonnées aux banlieues.  La moindre des choses c'est de reconnaitre quand on a merdé si on veut ensuite pouvoir avancer ensembles sans ressentiment. Si au contraire la seule chose qu'on propose c'est "oh c'est bon ça va fermez la, faisons front commun", faut pas s'étonner de se voir envoyer chier... La solidarité ça doit marcher dans les deux sens, hein.
Did you even read the books? Seriously, I don't know how you can just say that none of the characters have backstories, or only have one defining characteristic.   Almost every city-state, region, and place in Randland has a backstory as to why things are the way the are. Many of the characters motivations are explained through their raising, their history with each other, and their history as citizens in wherever they were raised.   Why are the Forsaken so evil? Every one of them has a backstory as to why they joined the shadow, and many of those stories were rehashed over and over again during the books. You even said that you think ASOIAF is more realistic "because the real world is dark and there are a lot of bad people only looking out for themselves"
Windows 10 also has this problem where you have to spend at least an hour installing Updates, even if you install from the latest .iso from Microsoft and it's only going to get worse the older it gets, especially for people who just have the CD their PC came with. I just don't understand why Windows can't do this update stuff at install time so that you end up with a finished system when it's done, the same way that Linux does. Some updates behave the same way the Windows 10 upgrade from an older version behaves, where it will pack your entire OS into C:\\Windows.old\ and perform what seems to be a completely new installation of the OS. That's just insane.

Evolution doesn't care about quality of life. The goal is to survive and reproduce. Cockroaches can survive a greater variety of conditions than humans and have way more offspring.
That at least gives me hope if the department can do that. I guess that won't be until later Sophmore year since Fall of 2016 will still be undecided. Any suggestions of some easy ECON/Math classes that can bring up GPA and still meet requirements?

PNW Group??  Did it get created?
I know it's not the same by any means after that length of time together, but I remain good friends with a couple of my 1 year+ relationship exes, whom I felt genuine love for after breakups under similar circumstances.   It is absolutely possible for two reasonable adults to feel a platonic affecting for one another after a relatively amicable split, regardless of how painful it is in the moment. I wish you well, this is the hardest part.

Will the war in Syria magically end? Will a compromise be reached in Yemen? Will protests end in Bahrain?  Israel has nothing to do with most Middle Eastern problems.  &gt;Oil prices will go down  Is Israel hiding a secret supply of oil? Will other countries drop oil prices as a result of displacing Israel?  This is not going to happen because Israel has nothing to do with oil prices.  &gt;inflation will go down  What the hell does Israel have to do with inflation? This is straight up alluding to the Jewish banking conspiracy.  &gt;whole world will be happy  I bet Israel will be overjoyed at the mass expulsion of its citizens.

Seems to me that if a candidate [is not elected in her own riding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_Clark#2013_re-election) then she should not be leading the province.  Not only does this demonstrate a disturbing lack of foresight on her part *(as well as on the part of the BC Liberal Party leadership)*, it also calls the nature of our democracy into question: if a party can install a politician, regardless of the public will, then can we really call her a representative of the people?

no real bhop servers dont run autobhop, these are mostly in css only tho as GO is trash for bhopping legit this is why most servers use autobhop.   Surf on the other hand allways used autobhop as its needed in multiple maps to even finish them. Plus most good surf servers limit autobhopping to the places its needed only.   Autostrafe takes away one of the most important parts of Surfing.   i mean as long as its not autostrafe only i dont care the map problem still remains

A few people were even claiming in 2012 that Texas might become a battleground state by 2016. I think becoming a swing state by 2028 is very likely. More likely than it remaining solidly Republican.
Believe it or not there are fighters in the UFC that are better than some of the champions of other divisions. It just so happens they're either to big or two small for those other divisions and aren't quite as good as the champion of theirs. I have tons of love for Lawler but there are fighters in the UFC that are better than him. There are also fighters in the UFC that are better than Conor (go figure) who lost to Nate Diaz. Cormier can be behind Jones and still physically be the 2nd best fighter in the UFC (Not that I believe he is). Cormier should get more love in the P4P discussion when the only person hes struggled with was Jones.. and they've only fought once.

Check those because they're notorious for going out on our bikes because of the shitty ass quality of factory grade parts from that year.   Please God do not replace those parts with stock factory parts from Suzuki or your due to short out again if this is indeed your issue. Good quality aftermarket is what you want.

The key is the persecution part. Be aware there are tens of thousands of migrants from non war torn counties trying to get refugee status they don't deserve just for economic gain. No, you don't deserve refugee status just because you suffer a low socio economic status in your native country. Refugee status is for peoples displaced by war, famine, and those who fear persecution for their beliefs such as faith and sexual orientation

If the game already has SBS 3D, Virtual Desktop will, and soon BigScreen will as well (according to the devs on the Steam forums).  The benefit to VorpX here is that it injects stereo 3D into games that otherwise aren't.  I'm probably going to use a combo of both VorpX and BigScreen.

First of all thank you so much for the feedback, it's a really effective way for me to get better so honestly thanks a lot man. Yeah I listen to a lot of mac demarco and Homeshake (his guitarist) so lots of inspiration is drawn from there. I definitely think your right about a solo, it could really mix it up, probably better than a further verse would do. I think double vocals on the chorus would be a good idea as well, just wondering if I'd be able to pull off the mixing for that correctly, worth a try though. I'm really glad you like the lyrics, that's what my favourite part of writing is and so it's really motivating to hear that there is no fault in them. I'll have to try that saturation on the vocals as well. Thanks for all the help, these projects I've been doing recently have really been exciting me, hopefully I get enough done for a full tape.   Also you're right about mona, that was kind of sloppily produced, there was no bass line at all in it and the guitar sometimes went out of time as did the drums, the cymbals were far too loud as well, hopefully once I give a go at cleaning it up it'll polish up nicely.
Anna is a really freaky experience. I think what does it is that fact that the only way to survive the game is to ignore what is happening. You cant run. You cant hide. You can only look away and hope it goes away.  The creepiness of the second floor of that house is engraved in my mind.   Also it has a beautiful soundtrack and the graphics are quite good.
That only means that the falcon is Corellian, but I guess it could imply that Han is as well. In legends he is Corellian

Unfortunately, there is actually no non-cosmetic content directly relating to **Halo Reach** in the entire update save for possibly the two unrevealed REQ weapons/vehicles.  * Infection has been in Halo 3, Reach and 4  * Brute Plasma Rifle debuted in Halo *2*. They should have spent their time on the Grenade Launcher instead  * The only map in the update is a remix of Torque. These should have spent that time on a Reach map or even a Reach forge map. Just *something* Reach-related.  Memories of Reach is missing a lot, even if those two unrevealed REQs are Jorge's Turret and the Falcon. I guess 343 got the name of the update down perfectly, because you will only get faint memories of Reach from this pretty average update...
Alright cheers man !
Sorry about that! You should be good now, I'm online.
*bad wording/grammar.  As an Asian guy, if she told me she was 16 I would believe it, if she told me she was 26 I would also believe it.   Kinda like how most white people can't tell if an asian girl is in their 20, 30 or 40s, white girls usually mature much faster and confuse Asian boners.

I have had my parents pick me up from school 3 times because I had pain so bad I felt like I was going to pass out. And one day I woke up on my period and was in so much pain I couldn't move and stayed home. It differs from woman to woman and I'm one of the unlucky ones who has to pop painkillers every month, but then again there are also women who get diarrhea on their periods every month so it could be worse.
Oh shoot. Just got in. Thanks fam

No, absolutely not. People deal with death differently even on the emotional levels. I wasn't overly emotional when my grandmother died but my brother was a wreck. 
When I was just a baby, my mama told me. "Son,  Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns."  But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
I was wrestling a pillow and I went to uppercut it. I had low ceilings and I was on my bed.  Punched a hole straight through my ceiling!
Ok, so a couple of things:  First of all, Group B cars are extremely tough, and second of all, sorry for the long post, tried to answer as many questions that might pop up as possible, and try to point anyone new in the right direction.  ------------------------------------------  It's a bit unclear if you are blaming the "falling of the cliffs"-part on the setup or not, but if you do, that's not really right. A setup is neither going to throw you off the cliff, nor keep you on the road. A setup can tweak your car to better fit your driving style, and allow you to take some corners faster, whilst having to sacrifice your pace on some other ones that don't fit the setup.   Before even starting with setups at all, I recommend learning how to keep your focus, and keep it on the right things, so that you're capable of running a rally stage without continuously crashing/spinning. As I said earlier a setup won't make or break it, it can just tweak your handling, but to actually use your handling you must "learn to drive" so-to-say. (You don't mention if this is something you can do, but all this is more general, for everyone)  So I can't show you a setup as I'm on mobile, but I'll just go through how I setup all cars. Also worth mentioning is that you say that the diff is not strong enough, which I can understand, but it's just how it is, all cars are different. You should look into learning techniques to work around it, such as flicking, left-foot braking, or just getting better by practice.  Also you complain that the brakes aren't giving enough power when it's set so much to the rear. This should not be something to worry about, most often brakes are used to give front traction or rotate the car around ahead of a corner. What actually slows down your car is the gravel running against your tire's sidewalls, which is much more efficient than your brakes, even when biased to deliver as much brake power as possible. This is partly because your tires will lock, and btw, turn off ABS if it's on. Locking your brakes will make your car rotate easily (making it easier to rotate without as much rear bias as well), and let you slide, the proper way to stop and often approach a corner. It's worth saying that one of the "aliens" (super good players) do run with as much as ~80% rear bias, and they set world records left and right.  So also before going on to set up the car, don't blame your mistakes on setups (unless you make a really really off one), if you're good with the car you can set regular top 10 world records with the default setup: there are people who do that even when running no-restart events. It's also worth noting that the game hasn't been out on consoles for very long, and I didn't start fiddling with setups until 250+ hours into the game, though I believe I started a bit late, but just saying that there's no rush, and it might be worth spending the setup time on normal practice.  Now finally for the actual setups for cars, wohoo! These things I do on all non-tarmac rallies, though I often do something similar on tarmac ones, but not as extreme.  Brake bias: if it's a non-RWD, 70-40% rear bias, depending on car and conditions.   Front diff: As loose as possible  Center diff: default  Rear diff: as strong as possible  Gears: very car dependent, default usually works fine, with the exception of some cars in Finland or Germany, where the gears need to be way longer.  Suspension (I only touch the overview slider, nothing in the advanced setup screen): keep rear and front at the same value, stiffen 1 or 2 steps from default, the older the car, the less stiffening, and generally much stiffer on tarmac.  Damping: Basically always left untouched with the exception of Finland in older classes, where I usually soften them 1 or 2 steps from default.  This setup style is close to what Porkhammer uses (an alien), and usually it's based on turning in and rotating the car fully long before the corner starts, and powering through it, balancing the throttle and the brake to keep the car on the road, and in the middle. This is a tough driving style that requires a lot of confidence, and it's quite hard to start out with. Something that makes it hard is that the diff settings will make your car slide **a lot** when using full throttle when going sideways, making throttle-control very important.  Sorry if I seemed a bit rude before, it's definitely not my intention, but this is a very tough game, and if you are only left blaming on the game, not feeling motivated to actually improve your own driving or continue, it kinda looses it's fun. Also, it's a bit hard to know what level you are at, and most of what I wrote is just general stuff of how I view it. I might have misunderstood everything you wrote and just screwed up :p but I know how frustrating the game can be, so it's definitely understandable that you are frustrated. My recommendation is take a break, maybe a few days or a week, or more, it usually helps both frustration and can somehow make you faster and more consistent, usually works for me.  My personal recommendation if it wasn't clear earlier, skip setups, and drive the default one (which if you didn't know, is made by the dev team, where it's different for each car in each location, not just every slider set at 50% or something).

The gigabyte 390 is notorious for having the worst cooler on any 390, so I'm concerned it might be overheating - can you use a monitoring program like gpu-z and report back the highest temperature you observe from gaming?
"Actinotherapy" is the more general term for light therapy (under which laser falls). You may find more research discussing actinotherapy.  If you want a great deal of research on the topic. http://www.lasertherapyu.org/ publishes research about laser therapy.

Nope. It takes a couple seconds to backup your save game files onto sony's cloud, as well as to a USB. I recomend you do both, not just due to the risk of hackers, but also general crashes or server kicks that could possibly corrupt your file. Just take a minute after every play session to do so and you are set, and at worse, you'd only ever lose your current session's progress. 
Ill take back that comment then O_O
Neighborhoods and Dogs Eating Dogs didn't get much radio play ... Meaning the last time they had a big / new radio single was 2004 and you were 8 years old.  This might be the biggest factor.  I just was talking to someone that said they just heard the single on the radio in Miami. Since the 'Bored To Death' YouTube lyric video has passed all of the Dogs Eating Dogs videos combined ... It should become a hit and get a decent amount of radio time.

If you are going to spam screw developments, its best (in terms of long-term) to do it for things that aren't available as much for the screw daily and that you need alot of. Typically this means quints. Obviously you can't improve only quints but I would bias it towards them.

The moment the game really clicked for me was Undead Burg. Fighting the shield-skeleton guarding the stairs down to the merchant. We danced a dance for a while. I'd swing, he'd block, nothing would come of it. We stood shield to shield for a bit. Frustrated, I kicked him.   His guard broke, and it stumbled - I pressed in and slashed, and he fell. Finally, I understood. Moves, combos, playing smart. After that, I could take him out easy, every time. Same with the rest of the enemies there. I needed to respect them still, for a misstep would still kill me. I had started to understand how the game worked, and from there it was upward. That was the first realization I had in the series.  My second realization was after my first run through Bloodborne. I had played it much like DS, slow and meticulous, and slowly learning how to respond to every threat. My first two nights playing Bloodborne, I didn't get as far as even Cleric Beast. Just ran the street repeatedly, trying to get through without using up all my healing items, trying to get a grasp of the game. 6-8 hours before actually fighting and killing Cleric Beast. When I had beat the game and started a new game [not NG+, but a true new character at low level], I ran through there and destroyed everything. What had taken me hours before I did in 30 minutes, not because my character had leveled up, but because *I had.* This was the moment I realized I was truly growing as a player in these games.  The final moment that I first began to think perhaps I had finally gotten gud was in DS3. Even in that BB playthrough the first time, I was always so afraid of each threat. Every boss room was trepidation and fear; every new threat I approached so cautiously and afraid. I felt like a weak spritely grain of sand against such enemies, and that I was surrounded by this menacing terror of a world I only needed to survive. Every big new enemy I saw I would avoid, stay back, level and run to and hope not to die. Every boss room requiring a full preparation for the expedition.  Not so in DS3. DS3, I found myself eagerly taking on every enemy that came before me. Every new big guy that presented itself, I found myself saying "Alright, sweetheart. Come here so I can kill you." I had lost my fear to press onward, my fear of losing souls or that I couldn't make it without the utmost caution. I started feeling cocky. I'd swagger into boss rooms as I'd find them, and was only too ready to on the fly start adapting to the challenges.   Three moments of realization, from understanding the basics, to competence, to gud, over two years of playing.

I have no clue why she said she was younger than she actually was, it really does confuse me, like honestly. But I have no clue why she would say she is younger.
Are you leaving her outside in the rain or overnight? The only time I've had runaways is by either missing a brushing after the 'Mangy' stage (I don't brush before then...) or by not taking them outside the barn ('outside' outside or Safari) if they're anything but 'pretty peppy'. 
There is a quest specifically to deal damage to an opponent, I see that as very definitive poor sportsmanship to immediately decide to disallow that damage.  Plus (less definitively I grant) this is a game some play for fun, and finally getting to do your fun stuff and having it wrenched away from you is hardly pleasant.
This is her 2nd marriage my first and her 3rd child (20,18 are the others) she makes a very comfortable income alone my dilemma is how do I give up pursuing my career as of late? How do I feel about spending money now that it is her income that is made? There is a pre nup involved and if things go south I am potentially losing a lot. Not sure there are two sides to a coin. 
I'm just doing my duty as a civil mexican.
YO THAT SHIT AIN'T RIGHT.
ill take some cake alone
ugh why does everybody think 0 months, it was 2 MONTHS!!!
We still run stretch pretty often
If you consider yourself a duck then it's ok for other people to kill you

Ah, yes.  ...Would that make Cinder the Vampire? Given her draining of the maiden power?
I know you blame others for your problems.  Have fun with Trump and his 70% unfavorable ratings.  He loves poorly educated people like you
I've seen a guy driving around when I'm doing my runs. Indian/asian descent. Always has earbuds in. Looks very stereotypical cabby. I've heard a few complaints from passengers that Cabbies are doing Uber work, I said the same thing to them to report them. It's horrible to stereotype someone but it's just the feeling I got every time I see him that he's just like that.  It drags the service down and to make it worse, takes work away from people who are good at the service.
Are you asking why don't i park in the open or why didnt the officer in the picture park out in the open? I cant really answer the 2nd one but i sometimes do if i have been warned by a citicen about a dangerous driver i will hide not because i want to hammer the guy, but because I want to have a reason to stop and speak with him. I will usually only write someone if i feel like speaking with them and writing them a warning will have no effect.

What?
One thing that helped was making her evaluate cell plans and phones. I made her do the research and told her we would then discuss it. She realized two phones with plans were expensive. Want another provider to stream movies? You evaluate the cost and get back to me. I am trying to teach her how to make informed purchases.  I make her pick up meds and pay for them, so she can see the cost. Sometimes I tell her I can't afford things that I probably could. She gets it now. 
Dam so Lavars ex-GF had a tracking device on him? That would cause somebody to flip the fuck out. Still not a excuse for punching her up but she must have a better chin the B.Schaub cause he was scared to even take 1 of em.
Interesting! I've heard the same thing about Sloughis.
You're totally right about us getting more overall, but it's manufactured scarcity. They could give us all a million crystals today and it would cost nothing. So taking from Peter to pay Paul like this doesn't make any sense, it's completely unnecessary. Losing the crystals is gonna sting no matter what, it's human nature. Not saying Netmarble is robots, but then again OMG ARE THEY ROBOTS?!?!

I think that "I'm pretty confident I can definitely beat... uh... Laila... sorry I forgot her name for a second" is one of the most underrated pieces of shade the show's seen. And I definitely agree that she's articulate and artistic, I wish she'd gotten to show more of what she does best.

Wait to see what evolve offers, boosted will have a gen 2 at some point.  If you want a more DIY style that's built already check out the enertion raptor (may take a while to ship), so you will be waiting anyway.  I have a raptor on order so I'll be making a video as soon as I get that.
I needs that video...
&gt; Again, why is ok to discriminate based on eye color but not skin color?   It's not, but there is no history in the US of systematic discrimination against people of a particular eye color. If there were it would likely be a protected class or on the list of things likely to become a protected class.
Yoona, from SNSD, has this pure/innocent image she needs to protect, so she probably would not agree to do silly ads, which is probably why they turn to other k-celebs. The cartoon ad you posted it from a very popular korean webtoon!

Honestly this sounds way too complicated to be fun. Also I don't like the weird forced competitive part. Sure, more producers of any kind already mean higher input prices, thus the production of the same amount of product becomes harder. But the economy moves to increase the production of those inputs. In this case though, this input is fixed, hardcoded in the universe. I don't see what it's trying to mimic from the real world nor why it's better than what we had in 2.0.
cheers!
It will never happen cause men are limited in the neptunia games are limited to bad guys, side characters like guards and bishops, and robots I could imagine Uni x Steamax though  and maybe Nepgear making a robot for her own pleasures

Nidalee traps have always revealed stealth units. I distinctly remember being able to see enemy wards nearby when someone stepped on a trap, way back in season 2.
[[Basilisk Collar]], [[Loxodon Warhammer]], and [[Batterskull]] are the only ways you can give him lifelink, but that makes life very easy for you if you pull it off.  Also cards like [[Thornbite Staff]] and [[Thousand-Year Elixir]] are hilarious too.  Over all, I played him as a big scary burn deck that blitzed him into play and nuked everyone down low enough as fast as possible to then burn them out.  Oh, also [[Arc-Slogger]] is possibly the best creature ever printed.

I never said anything about "shameful" but you are clearly very insecure about it. Fucking TFL-er masquerading as MGTOW.
Although I hadn't linked it to the lack of patriarchy, I already knew what you said about prehistorical mankind, with the exception about the bit on homogeneity. I can't imagine the world being a homogeneous blob just because of classlessness.   &gt;Just a fairly homogeneous genetic blob of mediocrity.  Why do you think it's impossible to prevent this in a communist society?   &gt;Well, politics always has to be about realistic acceptance of enforcement and finding like-minded men who will enter the mutual pact of insuring each other's rights—the aristocratic circle.  Why would they not give in to nepotism? Why would it not descend into a lame old bureaucracy?  &gt;Because we are higher status How is it decided that one is higher status? Who is "we"?  &gt;and earned it through our virtus.   What does this entail?  &gt;This is about men of merit and valor standing together against deceitful priests and the dysgenic mob.  When you say it like that, I imagine something much nicer than what I picture the reality looking like. You word it like it's the honorable warrior caste trying to fend off these parasites that only want to bring them down. In my eyes, it would really be just another case of a class oppressing other classes. Why does there have to be a state?   &gt;There's literally no hierarchy, though: no members of an aristo class, only the bottom primitive mob.  Of course there's no hierarchy. You don't need hierarchy to exalt greatness. People can still prove themselves to be exceptional human beings without needing to rule over another.   &gt;Did you see my Evola threads?  I've seen threads where you've written about Evola before but if you're talking about something you've written in the past 3 months, it's unlikely that I saw it.
You'll need to do the work to get it started. Start by talking to your parents, get their birthdays. If they have brothers and sisters, get their birthdays. Get your grandparent's birthdays. If there are any deceased members of family, get their death dates. Once you start entering this stuff in, Ancestry is fairly easy to go further. Ancestry won't show you information newer than 1940 (census records, for example) to protect the identities of the living.
Unfortunately, it sucks to be you.  I have also taken classes at a quarter-based institution, and mine had 3-quarter sequences for what would be a 2-semester sequence (for example, A&amp;P 1 through 3), with each course in the sequence being 4 quarter hours.   That comes out to 12 QH = 8 SH, and that is how I fulfilled my requirements.  You can't possibly be the first person from your college that ran into this. Does your school have an advising office? Or even a pre-health advising office? What can they tell you about this?  You will have only two options: retake A&amp;P someplace where you will get 8 SH of credit, or only apply to schools that will accept your 10 QH of credit.  (I guess you could also look for a 3rd class to take at your school that is worth at least 2 QH and falls under A&amp;P.)

I've been playing and got my first guitar about 14 years ago. It's an Ibanez SZ520 that I eventually stuck some new pickups in. It's got some dents and chips around the edges, but it still plays and sounds great.  But I'm in three bands, a cover band that plays 4-6 gigs a month and two original bands that play once every 4-6 weeks.  Basically, I make enough money for my gear to pay for itself :)

After shopping around last year we used [Reflect Window &amp; Door](http://www.reflectwindow.com/) to replace our 6'x8' picture window in the front of our house with a three pane custom. They were competitive with the pricing (got quotes from four places), very clear with the delivery times, quick and clean with the installation, and we're really happy with the results. We'll be using them again to replace some smaller side windows this year.

If you look young, the security or venue staff are very likely to ask you for ID. You might get in, you might not, but it's certainly a risk that you'll be refused entry.
Not even that, but apparently the bills had Ragland as their number two on their big board behind Shaq when pick 19 rolled around, and then they managed to get him. It's not just that they were value picks, these are guys the Bills actually wanted. 
No, your insurance company is (probably) not going to raise your insurance rates at any time unless you receive a traffic citation or are involved in an accident.  IOW, they don't give a shit.

 ###Live updates from ringside   3:31 PM - I'm here ringside. In the front row. Luis Bello just scored a quick first round stoppage. They quickly touted out the next pair of fighters. Jesus Aguinaga vs Adan Mares up now. Not sure if related to Abner but he is trained by Robert Garcia.   **Adan Mares vs Jesus Aguinaga**  Close first round, both fighters going at it on the inside. Mares took a lot of opportunities to score form the outside as Aguinaga telegraphs a lot of his shots from the outside. Danny Garcia just walks past as the round ends. He and the Fox crew are settling in ringside to deliver the nights blow-by-blow.  This fight is scheduled for 6 and it's on pace for it. We've seen a few low blows thus far as both guys are showing their commitment to the body. Aguinaga is settling back and letting Mares come to him, plotting to counter him on the way in.   Both guys have settled in and have figured the other out. Their faces both covered in blood. The space crowd is loving the action here.   This fight is brutal. They've both figured out the others defense and it's open season now. Blood is gushing from Mares face.   This one is wild. Mares found himself hurt in the 5th but Aguinaga couldn't capitalize. Fatigue is setting in. The weather here couldn't be better. 70 degrees, sunny, a nice breeze.   Blood is gushing out of the top of Mares's head. I could have sworn I just saw a squirt. His blood is dripping down Aquinas's back. These two are going all out to the bell, referee has to jump in to separate the pair after 6 rounds of ultra violence.   This fight is a draw. It looked like Aquinaga did a bit more damage, but nobody will complain about this one. There were enough punches landed to make it difficult to tell who won.   **Terrell Gausha vs Orlando Lora**  **Round 1**  Gauche starting fast behind his jab and he's keeping his distance. He's measuring nicely and keeping himself out of range of Lora's offense. Gausha scores with his 1-2. Lora goes to the body with his jab. Gausha avoids a right and ties up. Gausha looking for the range, lands a good right hand right down the middle. Gausha rips one down he middle, another one. Lora winces form the impact of that one. Gausha to the body with the left hand. Lora tries working Gausha on the ropes. Gets nothing. The 28 year old prospect easily  takes round 1.   ##Gausha 10-9  **Round 2**  Lora trying to find something on the inside. Gausha's movement bothering him. Lora finding his way inside but can't avoid the right. A right gets there for Gausha, right around the gloves. Gausha scores with the right again. Gausha using the lead hand to blind Lora. Brutal body shot from Gausha and a right hand to the head.   ##Gausha 10-9, 20-18   **Round 3**  Both fighters content to step toward the inside and work. Gausha getting the the better work in, he lands some vicious body shots. Gausha with a big lead left hook, that one made Lora take a step back. Lora's face looks like its on the verge of splitting with all the jabs and rights he's taken. A big right from Gausha makes Lora stagger backward. Lora might not be as hurt as Guasha thinks. The ropes are certainly holding him up. Lora lands a big right hook. Gausha in his guard, waiting. Lora bends forward and they're ear to ear. A right hook by Gausha at the bell.   ##Gausha 10-9, 30-27   **Round 4**  Gausha trying the right to the body and it works, goes upstairs, connects, lands the left to the body. Gausha settling into a dangerous rhythm here. A big left hook to the body by Gausha. Gausha lands the 1-2. Lora eats a big right hook. He's getting beaten on the inside by these traps Gausha is laying. Lora on the ropes, hard body shots and uppercuts from Gausha. Gausha is putting in work here on the inside, big right hook. A big left hook from Gausha is met by a left hook from Lora. Good exchange for both.   ##Gausha 10-9, 40-36   **Round 5**  Lora is aggressive coming out and pays for it as he eats a big right from Gausha. Gausha jabbing from the outside. A big right hook from Gausha. Gausha with the jab. Gausha jabs. A lead right from Gausha, that looped its way in. Another one. A left hook to the body by Gausha. Right hook by Gausha, head, body now. Gausha settles in this round, he's coasting now.  ##Gausha 10-9, 50-45  **Round 6**  Gausha circling and jabbing. A good right over the top from Gausha and a left hook. Lora tries trapping him in the corner and can't keep him there. Gausha easily escapes. The difference in footwork skill is drastic. A nice right from Gausha scores. A jab from Gausha and a huge right over the top. Another one. Lora looks like he might be hurt, theres blood now. Gausha back in his rhythm. Gausha is swinging for the fences now. Lora is gushing blood outside the left eye.   ##Gausha 10-9, 60-54   **Round 7**  Gausha boxing on the outside,e the cut on the outside of Lora's eye has gotten no better after the corner break. A big uppercut from Gausha. Gausha with the right. Lora is a bloody mess. A right around the gloves for Gausha. A nice 1-2 down the middle for Gausha. Lora with a nice left. Gausha with a 4 punch combination that connects. A nice right from Gausha. It seem like Lora isn't even interested in blocking the right hand. He's a bloody mess and his accepted it. A left hook for Gausha.   ##Gausha 10-9, 70-63  **Round 8**  The combination of the cut and the uncompetitiveness of the fight forces Lora's corner to stop the fight.   ##Official Ruling: Terrell Gausha TKO8

Found the fix on Bestheda's forums. This worked for me.   1. Delete Fallout 4 application data. Just navigate to the F4 icon in the PS menu, press the Options button and choose delete. Unfortunately on PS4 you cannot just delete DLC alone.  2. Turn off automatic downloads in the Settings menu.  3. Re-install Fallout 4. If you have a physical copy this bit is easy - just insert the disc and install. If like me you bought a digital copy, you'll have to re-download the whole thing. You may also be prompted to install purchased DLC - make sure you do not install Automatron!  4. Disconnect your PS4 from the internet. This may not be necessary if you disabled downloads, but I did it just to make sure. The option is under Settings, and then Network. Uncheck the box that says 'Connect to network'.  5. Start Fallout 4, loading the character you encountered the bug with. Make sure no Automatron quests or items are showing in the Pip-Boy, then create a new save. Close Fallout 4.  6. Connect to the internet and re-install Automatron.  7. Start Fallout 4 and load up the save you just made. The Automatron questline should start again from the beginning. Obviously you will lose the progress you made.  8. Create a new save and play through the questline as normal, but this time DO NOT build the robot workbench as soon as it's available. Building the workbench and modifying Ada seems to be what causes this bug. I also left Ada at a settlement while I went to the General Atomics factory. This may not be necessary, but I would do it just to be safe.  These steps allowed me to continue with the quest as intended, so I hope this helps anyone else having this problem.

Mine was 3 troll groups and 7 wait groups.  Finally one day, at 2 in the afternoon on a Monday, I just see a group marked "poonfist". I think it's a joke, but join anyway. There is a single level 95 shaman right at the spawn, begging for the people to come.   Fuck it.  Use meteor / feather combo. (No flying back then).  Actually fucking Poundfist. Proceed to tell others it's actually Poundfist.  About 4 of 30 make it. Alliance mythic geared hunter arrives.   Rotflblasts Poundfist with literally everything, manage to throw my weapon in to tag. Only 3 of the 5 of us there get the tag, the little shaman was not one of them.  Everyone is Pissed, mass reports abound.  My Sunhide Gronnaling is named Poonfist now.

1. Is Malig Knight!Corrin specifically only potent in Birthright like I've seen people say it is? Who is the spouse for this build and what is the best bane to take? 2. Any recommendations for Boons/Banes and secondary classes for marrying Kaden and Laslow? 3. What are the extra rewards for getting all 3 versions on one game over just 2?  Sorry for asking a lot of questions, I just want to be prepared for when this game finally hits Europe. Even if only one can be answered, throw it my way, it'd be appreciated.

Today was my younger dog's fourth birthday. We bought her cake.  TOTD: I've always been a big fan of YouTube video reviewers (JonTron, PBG, etc.)  Also Andrew Hussie, but I'd say that goes without saying.  AOTD1: RuneScape. I got into it when I was eight years old and I still play it to this day.  AOTD2: I'd say I'm a fairly fast reader. The only problem is I have a tendency of missing things if I read to fast, which made it so that I had to reread Homestuck a few times to 100% get everything.

Eh, I like Meteos. I like pretty much every C9 player.  Riot is a pretty shitty company, though. They're just Blizzard 2.0. Same shit with being unable to own up to mistakes, failing to listen to the community on major things (Replays, Sandbox, Dynamic Queue, etc). And they, just like Blizz, act like they're smart and the community are idiots.  Not sure how anyone can like the company, to be honest.
/u/bceltics933 for MVP. Entertaining.   It's a high risk high reward pick, the kind of choice you make with a late 4th. I don't think he'll pan out, but I'm excited, I hope he works out. 
Demar Derozan, he stops scoring and still impacts the game   :(
There really isn't a hiding mechanism and sneaking is more about staying outside the aggro range of Dino's. Movement speed is where it's at if your trying to avoid otherwise increase damage so you don't need to.  Bug repellent and Gillie suit are the two sneaking/hiding mechanisms that come to mind but both also have disadvantages. 
I can't believe you waste your precious genius mind coming up with witty comebacks for a website. You are wack
He asked about Vichy after the radar.
No I 100% agree! I found that it was weird in the opening cut scene it shows the goop but then all we actually see is a fucking man-grub (basically, closest comparison I could think of because of the weird blobby tail thing) in a purple coat. Great fight but poor build up. As far as shock value goes, it's not that big of a shock considering the fog wall is there from the get go.
There are aspects of gaming today I do like but for the most part, I don't like it. Games on Playstation and Xbox are so absorbed with graphics and shooters that it's a huge turn away for me. I miss pixels and sprites, give me those!   The stories aim to be so realistic that I find it very boring. I miss fantasy elements like Mario or Metroid, something completely of its own. I'm a big Nintendo fanboy but it feels like the spirit is still there. I'm just tired of all the gimmicks of motion control and other junk. I just want a controller.  There's so much complaining in the video game world nowadays. If you don't like it, don't play it, but don't spend all this time spewing vitriol about it and making online communities toxic. It seems like every time a new game is released it gets bashed immediately, as if it's cool to hate games now. Just be civil and stick to what you like. 
If the aliens sequences were as scary as Fire in The Sky i would've thought it was great. But as soon as the aliens were shown i was bored, they looked lame to me, and not scary at all. Dont get me wrong Fire in THe Sky is dated and not very scary looking back, but there was something much more realistic, i guess the practical effects vs CG
imo It's worth it, but I would check if everything works first.   Then get a new cooler, seems like theirs is breaking.

Games not even out yet, why keep asking if this place is a ghost town?   Of course it wont be sooner or later.
I was in a similar situation myself a few weeks ago but not as bad. Here's what I'd do:  Right now scrounge up as much cash as you can. That's really all you need to be focusing on.  Bring a backpack with water bottles, clothes you can layer, and a sleeping bag. And calorie dense food like breakfast bars, seeds, nuts.   You can use the restroom, fill up your water bottles, and sort of bathe in fast food bathrooms.  Once you get to your destination, hit up a local homeless shelter. If you travel light they'll see you don't have much to steal and you'll mostly get left alone. You'll meet some interesting/nice people along the way.   Get a job lawn mowing or landscaping or something like that. Usually those places don't look into your background too much and are willing to give you a shot. You just gotta work hard, but it'll be a decent paycheck for sure. Only problem is you have to eat a lot when you're doing manual labor, so again load up on calorie dense foods and water.  There ya go. Stay strong and just keep saving. It shouldn't be too hard if you're getting solid paychecks and don't have bills. Life will be boring but that can be good because you focus on survival. Once you have a few grand saved hit up Craigslist and rent out a room in someone's house or apartment.   There will be tough times and even when you do make it, it might not be as comfortable as your room back home was, but not living with bossy parents as a grown ass man is the ultimate feeling of freedom. 
I never understood Cheaters. Someone is gonna see what you're doing and report you. Why even take the risk?
There are no blades in a garbage disposal  rather there are two grinders.  They are fairly deep and one has to jam their hand down their entire sink and then down the machine itself to the very bottom where the grinders are.  All while the machine is making an insane amount of noise.  This is not something one could possibly do accidentally.  Also you can get them with a safety cover (batch feed) so it doesn't turn on unless the stopper is in place. 
But we're not talking about one event, we're talking about what is likely years of abuse on a developing mind. That can royally mess someone up.  When it comes down to it, people handle experiences differently. What might emotionally scar one person may leave another person relatively unscathed and these differences are for myriad reasons that scientists and doctors still don't really understand. Maybe you'll come out unscathed, but it's the risk of permanent damage and lifelong depression worth a couple million dollars? Especially when therapy isn't nearly the miracle system some people claim it to be. It can help you cope, but beyond that it's use is limited. In other words,  if successful (and that's a big if) it'll help you reason with yourself so that you don't kill yourself, but it won't stop the suicidal urges from coming.

&gt; What kind of party is it? &gt; What kind of medals are being shared? &gt; Does the party regularly chain Bosses?  I would describe it as a "hardcore" core party. In between hardcore and core. Some members are a bit low on lux, some other members are really pushing alot. I'm doingg 1,181,000 lux right now. I don't really care as long as you're reasonably active.   Mostly 6 stars. Some of my 6 stars that I can share: master form sora, limit form sora, black coat riku, minnie, king mickey, hercules, kh riku, donald ver. b., &amp; KH cloud. Other example of other members are KHII cloud, stitch, mushu, KHII riku, a maxed out KH cloud (no guilt bonus yet). A good selection of strong shared medals.   Raids show up daily. For raid chains, I'd say it happens often but probably not as often as more hardcore parties. Like I said, a "hardcore" core party.

Alright, then your claims seem fair. You don't want to stop people from thinking what they think, you just want to stop illegal behavior. I want that too.  I will just focus on one claim, because I need to sleep.  &gt;The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.  &gt;In terms of sanity, seriously, what is the difference in those two things?  There isn't. And I wouldn't actually care if the president did. It only shows that some voters are not only religious, but also stupid. But if some president would find a way to rally even the idiot, he would deserve my vote too.  I stand by my claim that the religious freaks are a minority. And they are insane. And they have some certain strings a politician need to pull. You see, these people, people who are terrorists by nature, they will find anything to fight for. Religion, atheism, dogmatism, capitalism, socialism, conservatism, you name it. And you need to rally them. Religion is a useful weapon sometimes employed by a politician. And we know why the politician is doing what he's doing. We nod our head, and fool the fools. I don't actually believe that the president is insane. I don't believe Obama wakes up to scripture on his blackberry. But he needs to rally the terrorists in Texas, so he says that shit.  I learned in life that some people are cynical, stupid, and insane. You need to pull their strings. If they pretend they want to hurt you, just pretend they're the boss, and in return, they will respect you.  Anyway, i need to go now. I will return tomorrow with the list.

If you're looking to go at it on your own, and you don't have a family to worry about, why not save some money and downsize to a nicely equipped X3 or X1? If you're looking to stay with BMW, both are good options in their segment, and would likely be a better way to go if you aren't using the size of the X5 accordingly.  However, I'd also advise shopping around a bit. Assuming that you'd want to continue leasing, and coming into a strong sales season for most brands, some may be willing to offer a competitive lease offer to get you behind the wheel of one of theirs... Think Mercedes GLC, Lexus NX, and the like. Much of that would come down to what you prefer most, and as you've stated, if interiors are the most important part to you, you're going to have to sit in as many as possible.  If it were my money, I'd look to both downsize and look for better options when it comes to performance and value. As much as I like many of the luxury offerings on deck these days, there are plenty of competitive mid and low level cars that are offering nearly equal levels of performance and craftsmanship to many of the luxury offerings. If you're dead set at $45k, there are far too many good options out there to make a truly terrible decision.

Being a massive Rory fan, one of my favourites was Rory vs Lawler II. Rory's Combos at the end of round three were so sick - I have no idea how Lawler didn't get knocked out!   Also, another obvious one is Lawler vs Condit - the guys could barely walk by the end of it, they left their all in the cage. Both fighters were amazing to watch, and it was such a closely fought match. The third fight I'm gonna throw in there as one of my favourite fights is Jim Miller vs Joe Lauzon. I believe it was FOTY, and the whole fight was just such a roller coaster, was a stellar fight.

If low trust causes lower property values, that wouldn't necessarily show up if you're looking at inequality or poverty. It's the fact that the neighborhood's property becomes worth less than it otherwise would have been that's important. The counterfactual values of the homes can't be observed. A highly egalitarian community's property could still be lowered in value by a lack of social trust.

It can be, but if you mention the rolling grassy fields of New York City for example, that's probably going to throw your readers off.  You can always use a random town name but not go into specifics.  Think of Springfield from The Simpsons, albeit without the lampshade hanging about where the hell it is.

We have a responsibility to disregard unlawful orders, to follow an unlawful order is illegal. But to answer the earlier question, there are some ways to get out, but they are limited. If you're still in the first six months you can push for an administrative discharge which basically says that you aren't suited for military life. When manning was too high they were taking voluntary applications for discharge, but now we're short handed and that no longer applies. Basically you'd have to fake mental illness or something like that and hope for a discharge if you really wanted out.
Not only that, but then you start opening up a giant can of worms. Imagine if manufacturers were responsible for their products being used in crimes. Now, the manufacturer is going to be extremely selective about to whom they sell their product. But, if they do that and their customers are representative of the population, they will inevitably end up refusing to sell to one race over another simply by statistical evidence of crime. If they start applying higher standards for previous crimes committed, then their selling practices will look different based on race. So, you open yourself up to discrimination lawsuits by the DOJ, but if you sell without being careful and they're used in a crime, you open yourself up to lawsuits by the DOJ. In the end, government wins.

Not exactly. Weird Al's "Smells Like Nirvana" was fair use because it made fun of Nirvana and "Smells Like Teen Spirit".   On the other hand, "The Saga Begins" was not considered fair use because while Al used the same tune as "American Pie", the song parodied Episode One and in no way parodied the original song.   In order for fair use to be in play the parody has to be direct.

I believe it's called raising gazorpazorp. In the beginning, Morty finds a sex doll with Rick in a pawn shop. The doll gets gives birth and Rick/Summer go to some matriarchal planet while Morty is at home trying to raise his offspring.

I agree with that at least.
You can walk away from marriage anytime you want to.  You seem to be forgetting that.  There is literally no difference, or you are denying that.  As for definition: Oxford dictionary (definition 1)  - The legally or formally recognized union of a man and a woman (or, in some jurisdictions, two people of the same sex) as partners in a relationship.  Common law marriages are both legal and recognized.  Also, from Websters Dictionary: The act of marrying, or the state of being married; legal union of a man and a woman for life, as husband and wife; wedlock; matrimony.  Common law is a legal union.  Just because you have a piece of paper saying you had a big party doesn't make you better, different or special.   From your 'culture' comment, I can see you are an out an out bigot, and thus cannot be reasoned with.  I only have pity for you.  Go fade of into the sunset, fossil.
Hell Yea!
Hey man you're welcome... That's what this Reddit/workshop is for.  A lot of this seems trochaic in terms of rhythmic feet. Have you tried just picking a certain number of feet per line and then rearranging the word order to make all of it (or at least most of it) trochaic?

Aww!!! I wonder if it'll one day grow up to be a full sized board. Please tell me you have the exact same board with full sized pedals instead? 
No, it's about destroying public education to replace it with taxpayer funded for-profit and religious schools.   Odd alliance, perhaps, but the Koch brothers and friends see all that money being spent, and get none of it; the religious right wants their schools paid for by taxpayers, and so do their "conservative" Catholic allies.   Wisconsin was the leading experiment in how much they could get away with, funded by the Bradley Foundation and the DeVos family (Amway) fortunes. In several states (Jindal's Louisiana), voucher programs were ruled to be unconstitutional, so ALEC came up with the subterfuge "scholarship" legislation, now passed in more than twenty states (see ALEC's State Policy Network with affiliates in every state).   They've been a windfall for Catholic and other religious schools, and for-profit charters. They claim the scholarships will go to needy students in low performing schools. The truth is that they need the money, our money. 
Keep in mind that a lot of the dictators were actually created and supported by the West.

PC technical noob here looking at upgrading my current build  I plan to upgrade from a GTX 640 to a XFX Radeon R9 380 and to get a new EVGA bronze 600W power supply replacing my old Cooler Master eXtreme Power Plus 500W. However, looking into the tiny details, I noticed that a 640 has a single slot for example and a XFX R9 380 has dual slot.  My question is how do I know if this switch is compatible with the current build I have?
That's not a good comparison. I didn't say it had to be all about Mickey; just that it has to be about *Disney* characters if it's a *Disney* magazine. The same way you woudn't find characters from series from the editor Dupuis in the Tintin magazine, which was published by the editor Lombard.
You may be thinking of vegetarianism. Vegans also boycott leather, fur and all other animal products. It's an ethical position.
not really  It might help to get an immediate sense of familiarity, which may be more important for sci-fi or urban fantasy for example. More often than not, the name of the location adds nothing to the story and might as well not be mentioned at all.

I say no. Whereas I LOVE bro's deck and attribute a fair proportion of my step1 score to it, I don't think it is the best way to use your dedicated. Especially if you have not done any of it so far.  I say this because there will be a significant number of cards that are either too basic or too low yield, particularly the ones he added from his classes, which are not in first aid. I too have just used anki throughout my first two years, but 800-1000 cards a day is a LOT.  I ended up going through FA and making my own cards on shit I considered high yield and didnt know. Usually ended up being anywhere from 100-250 cards per chapter. The returns from these cards were much more than bro's at THAT stage of my step1 studying.  EDIT: There's also a chunk of stuff that is in FA but not in Bro's deck. Also, seeing the tables/diagrams in FA is much more helpful for integrating information than the binary facts that are presented in the anki deck. Once again, as a disclaimer, his deck is an incredible resource. But I believe the correct time to use it is not dedicated.

I have really mixed feelings about simple skincare. I used them in high school, and they are definitely an adequate moisturizer, but in my opinion they take living up to the simple name a bit too far. They are pretty meh ingredients wise. I also don't agree with the use of sillicones for environmental reasons. It doesn't biodegrade, and there are so many alternatives. Broccoli seed and camellia oil both have a similar makeup, without the damage. 
Interesting.  You think your current situation in life would be potential fodder for insults.   Anyway, it's rather ironic how we've gone 180 on the vaccine issue.  I used to argue with the internet "science" crowd on how flawed the lancet autism study was.   Your arguments mirrors theirs.

Well, the more you know I guess.
Seems like an imperative for this next generation to be able to push 60+ FPS at 4K with ultra settings on the latest titles. We would need what, a 50% increase over 980 Ti performance to get there? I think they're going to milk this for a while longer, and that 4K gaming will become the domain of 2x 1080 SLI instead of 2x 980 Ti, and then maybe the 1080 Ti will be enough to get there with a single card.

I don't know much about drivers, but I definitely see your point.   When Dark Souls III was released, there were several groups of people. There was the group where everything ran like shit, no matter what their settings were. Then there was the group that got 60 fps on Ultra.   I was in the latter group. I was able to run the game on Ultra, almost consistent 60 FPS with a GTX 760.   Others who had a better PC than mine kept mentioning stutters and crashes. I saw none of that.

Technically airsoft guns are too.  **N.J.A.C. 13:54-1.2 Definitions**  &gt;"Firearm or firearms" means any handgun, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, automatic or semi-automatic rifle, or any gun, device or instrument in the nature of a weapon from which may be fired or ejected any solid projectable ball, slug, pellet, missile or bullet, or any gas, vapor or other noxious thing, by means of a cartridge or shell or by the action of an explosive or the igniting of flammable or explosive substances. It shall also include, without limitation, any firearm, which is in the nature of an air gun, spring gun or pistol or other weapon of a similar nature in which the propelling force is a spring, elastic band, carbon dioxide, compressed or other gas or vapor, air or compressed air, or is ignited by compressed air, and ejecting a bullet or missile smaller than three-eighths of an inch in diameter, with sufficient force to injure a person.

I'm pretty new to this -- didn't know that was actually an option. I thought VTSMX was just its own "fund" that could be part of a diverse portfolio or just be another type of investment account. When people talk about three-fund portfolios (and I see a lot of articles about VTSMX being one of the 3), do they also mean that one of those could be part of a Roth IRA?
Bwahaha ! XD  I wasn't expecting you to be that gullible. I don't feel bad from talking with you. I was just joking about what I thought really looked like Tsundere usual catchphrases.   You're kind.

Don't let them break you like they broke me.

if its fantasy like that i make a super basic language system, more like a sound system. just some basic sounds you can string together to make things sound like each other. then generate something for this. my original answer was going to be name it after something, like an area its from, or what its good for, or what it reminded people of back when it got its name, some lore piece. but then i thought how that might depend on the sound system above. if you're using English just make whatever.

Oh yeah I didn't really assume the fence would do much. It was on sale at a thrift store though and my grandma picked it up for me. I figured it couldn't hurt and decided to put it in, even if it was purely aesthetic. As for why we assume it's a porcupine, our dog had to go outside late at night a few days ago and when we went outside a porcupine was right next to the garden. I know there's one in the area because one of our tree's got almost entirely destroyed. I suppose it could possibly be a squirrel though, since we've only caught the porcupine in action once. I planted about 100 crocus bulbs though and they all have been partially eaten in one way or another, so I have no idea if that rules out smaller critters or not. Plus the fact that the fence got torn out so it's probably something bigger (and it wouldn't be people, I live at the end of a back road) As for the others, there's no evidence of a groundhog on our property, I'm not sure I've ever seen a skunk or raccoon on our property, and we do not have possums in our area. We do have a lot of rabbits. Is it possible rabbits would do damage to the bulbs themselves rather than just the greens? Thanks for replying btw.

It's really nice that they got excited for you.

They were lovely and nice, I went home and thought about the dress for a long time before buying, but when I showed a cousin the dresses I had tried on she was crying saying they were beautiful, another friend at the appointment kept tearing up- I felt like I was shopping. (I wonder if paying for it myself also factored in, like, I'm excited but also bye bye lots of money) ?

"i was no longer driving, it was like i was in a tunnel and i kept moving outside of my conscious range  with graffiti it causes me a sense ofsome people meditate do yoga and exercise but theynnever cut if for me.   ive always struggled with depression and graffiti filled that void due to the fact that when i did it i felt invisible. my perceptive problems vanished into the wnd. i felt calm and in control.   this leads to my conclusion. im a normal human like yourslef, i work, i pay my taxes (and not that finances count) im surprisingly financial stable. actually bought my first house last week! not bad for a 23 year old i mast ad. its amazing what the stock can do im just like you, but i feel an illness inside of me that i need to express. also to show that society isnt totally in control.   if your not happy with your 9-5, quit! follow your heart in life and lets face it, all humans hearts are looking for is happiness :)  preserve the natural jungle, destroy the cement one.   hope this give some insight to a graffiti writer first hand.  ill finish this a beautiful elegant quote..

Just took a game break and looked on here, and couldn't be more perfect timing to read this thread. Went through three random tanks just now. The first ran past whole group's of enemies, leaving me (squishie healer) to figure out what the heck to do. The second quit in 3 minutes after moving way to far in for me to heal, pulling too many enemies at once, and dying.  The third was the best. Bow wielding nightblade who clearly queued as tank just to get in. Made it through two fights, then he somehow makes it past a mini boss without killing it and heads on in, meaning (a) yours truly was sorta stuck, and (b) we wouldn't be getting the undaunted completion even if we could somehow kill the boss, which was next to impossible without someone tanking it. (first mate boss in blackheart)  At one point, I messaged him, because of course he wasn't in chat, and asked if he had any taunt abilities he could uae, and no answer. Guess who got kicked...

Nice, yeah I think having family leave benefits the society a lot. Not just the parents but the children as well, some of my fondest childhood memories are those of vacations with my mom and dad as that was the only time I really got to spend with my dad because he worked so much. Family is so important for a functional society.   I spent half my life in Russia (was born there) and half my life in the UK. When I moved to USA I was shocked at just how little time off people here get.

I've met a few Rabbis who turned out to be fake Rabbis. That's way more common than you think.  They aren't "fake" in that they don't know Torah or they don't know follow the religion. They're fake in that they don't have the certification. They still do all of the same shit and so on.   That being said, certification lowers the risk of people attempting to take advantage of members of the community. So you need to have it.

&gt;Players leave. Move on, support your club, and quit complaining, on another clubs sub, about something that is truthfully the fault of your management.  What a load of bullshit. So what, it's the fault of my club's management for not being able to inject it with money? Or do you honestly believe that there's anything other than financial muscles keeping Bayern where they are? Considering the kind of resources Dortmund have had the last 10 years, the management has been perfect.  &gt;Players leave. Move on, support your club, and quit complaining,  Again, easy for a Bayern fan to say. You never end up in this position. You guys even complained and whistled when Ballack moved to a club outside of Germany.
Your are right. But Cruz is not terminal like Trump. He might improve his numbers if he starts to campaign in the general election.

I'm sorry, I'm new here; but what is the point of an under 21 ID? I'm correctly assuming that u21 stands for that right? Is it just for kids who are under 18, don't think they can pass for 21, and want it for clubs/cigs/bongs and such?  Edit: Nevermind, I did a little research on it. u21 is definitely the way to go for Florida, I'd be really interested in an estimate of how long until you guys will be offering one. /u/DavinciFakes
I've got a pair of Dahlquist DQ10s that I'm looking to sell.

I've also got a "son of ampzilla" that I used to make sure they worked, as well as some of the manuals/advertisements for the speakers and amp.  Anyone have advice as to how/where to sell these things? Should I make a whole new post, instead of just this?

&gt; It is comparing the suicide attempts after surgery vs the general population, not before and after surgery. All it is saying is that surgery is not a magic fix, and there should still be psychiatric treatment after SRS: &gt; As for the later, I have actually read this in the past, and it does not support the narrative you are trying to paint. In fact, the person who authored this disagrees with people who misattribute the study. Hell, if you doubt the legitimacy of TransAdvocate, she gives a nod to the article on fucking reddit!  Fair enough. So what about this then?  &gt;There is no conclusive evidence that sex change operations improve the lives of transsexuals, with many people remaining severely distressed and even suicidal after the operation, according to a medical review conducted exclusively for Guardian Weekend tomorrow. The review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the University of Birmingham's aggressive research intelligence facility (Arif) found no robust scientific evidence that gender reassignment surgery is clinically effective.  That sounds pretty clear to me.  Edit: And more, here are some words from the psychiatrist in chief of John Hopkins' -  &gt; Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the former psychiatrist-in-chief for Johns Hopkins Hospital and its current Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry, said that transgenderism is a “mental disorder” that merits treatment, that sex change is “biologically impossible,” and that people who promote sexual reassignment surgery are collaborating with and promoting a mental disorder.  &gt; http://cnsnews.com/news/article/michael-w-chapman/johns-hopkins-psychiatrist-transgender-mental-disorder-sex-change  Try getting through the whole thing, then checking out his article in the WSJ. There is no proof that transition surgery works, afterward patients still have insanely high suicide rates, and so on. I even saw a study that said 80% of post op patients were happy, but of the 732 odd patients who were contacted for interviews half of them were dead and all about Just over 200 wanted to comment.

We have powerplay allergies as players, but saying that Rise to Power means that we'll be involved in setting up a powerplay faction of some sort eventually.  Nobody likes powerplay though and whilst the ingame lore is neato it's not too large of a focus.  Adamant is supporting the DF in-game faction for now, branching off from that is something we're thinking about, but no definite answers yet.

Earth is almost 4.5 billions of years old. We can actually measure the CO2 levels before the official recording. It is a very sofisticated technique that involve the analysis of the bubble of air trapped into ice caps and rocks that have been carbon - dated.  Anyway, the actual science is not the point. On the website of Mr Trump, you can find this &gt;Climate Change: It is a hoax. Trump does not believe climate change is real, tweeting out his skepticism with strong language and calling it a hoax on Fox News in 2014. In a 2012 Twitter post which is no longer accessible, Trump charged that the concept of climate change was created by the Chinese to suppress the U.S. economy. In addition, Trump has expressed firm opposition to wind turbines, which he sees as an environmental and aesthetic problem.  So we have two positions. Trump and the scientific comunity. For me that would be a dealbreaker in a candidate. The conscious choise of refusing such an important scientific fact entirely, calling it AN HOAX.  But I guess I mostly have my answer by now.  I invite you all to reconsider your opinions at least on this.   I go to bed, will read again tomorrow.

Yah, it's taking a while for some states to get on board. Guam passed a law allowing medical marijuana in Nov 2014, wrote some rules last summer (2015) around it  [Guam medical marijuana] (http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx). So I would ask around as it's going to be operational very soon. I read an article from a month ago that said there in the final stages of review, so hopefully patients will get the needed help soon. (as far as dispensaries, let's hope there's a parallel effort to make it available! Otherwise, I wonder if they'd mail order from California, being Guam and all, military planes!)   p.s. the reaction was probably because of change in another medication that has a known interaction between the two drugs or the source of the tramadol. I've switched from regular to generic and had some new side effects. I would also look at the extra buffer ingredients that go into the pill, sometimes there's a change in one and it causes an allergy. For example, sometime soy lecithin is added to so much and some individuals are sensitive to soy. It'd be worth getting an IgE allergy test as you may also have developed a new allergy. A friend who lived in Japan for a while developed an allergy to pine as they planted Sagu pine all over the city and many Japanese are now allergic.

Having battlecry minions pulled from Varian does suck, however sylvanus doesn't fit well into the deck, since you work from the premise that you are ahead on board by turn 6. Also sylvanus from varian isn't great since the varian is normally removed with mass removal (eq, twisting nether) and its not sticky. But in general regarding Varian these battle cry effects are weak at turn 10 (except malkrok) so the body alone is fine

You could try for the Tangerine credit card. You get 2% cash back 2 categories or 3 categories if you have the cash back automatically deposited into a Tangerine savings account, and 1% back elsewhere. They don't have any specific income requirements as far as I know, but you do "need an income". While most cards just above entry-level require 15K annual income, this might not be the magic number for this card. Call them up and see. As far as free cards go that don't have a set income requirement (although for those cards you might be able to haggle a little, I haven't tried), this card is the best I know of.   If possible, you could give them a little more to raise your credit limit AND apply for another card or two if that would help you maximise cash back, because then you would have even more credit and it would be easier to stay under 30% utilization. If you're not getting anything other than a higher credit limit, the added complexity likely isn't worth it. Good luck!
Still a damn good card now. I'm waiting until I get a new case with better airflow to keep my 970 cooler to over clock it to 1.5 GHz

This is just from experience and massive amounts of data I have taken - bullet sorting is a waste of time as long as they are from the same lot. Annealing can do more harm than good unless you have factory conditions - it is something that should be done only occasionally depending on the round. I have found that for my Lapua .308 Palma brass, only every 7th firing does annealing help. I would imagine (and I am new to the round) that 10th or higher firing on Lapua .223 brass would be needed.  Also, if you are willing to spend on them, I'd move to Berger for the bolt gun, and make sure your rounds are touching the lands. Working on your fundamentals will always yield better results, but I think there might be more to unlock in the raw performance of that bolt gun.

Like everyone else, I've always been suspicious about strand and it can't be anymore obvious. Regardless of what he is up to and where he is going, he knows people are both a danger and a liability.   Those children from the island in episode 2 he knew were a liability and a responsibility he didn't want. Same with the people on the dinghy in episode 1. He knows numbers, especially at sea, won't help.   Judging by who we saw was clogging up the filter under the boat the Asian girl isn't trust worthy anyway. The burned man is not going to live with those injuries. Strand is going to his destination, he's saved these people o along the way (with their help) and now they are making decisions for him. I'm glad he cut that damn rope, he needed to put his crew in line.

First of all, the emergency services don't know how far down the runway the aircraft will go until it stops. If it landed and an engine dug into the ground and tore off right away, it wouldn't help to have emergency services at the other end of the runway.  Secondly, following the aircraft allows the emergency crews to examine and monitor the aircraft at all times, and report any parts etc that may have come off either for later investigation or simply for other crews to clear up afterwards.  Thirdly, it's safer to follow an aircraft down the runway than it is to be ahead of an aircraft that may potentially run off the runway.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was a federal law up until the mid 1960s. It's regarded as one of the most dispacable and horrendous pieces of legislation that the US has ever passed into law.  My point was not to condone breaking the law, rather to point out that a lot of the immigration laws that were passed almost 100 years ago we're fundamentally discriminatory in their creation.

So you mean when he sits down to play, everything is already a part of him? Is aim for him about precision? Do people talk about his onetaps?
Burke is the whole damn show lol.

Yes, though [MK](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_list&amp;c=140) has probably a better selection. Cooler master makes some good kit, but Ducky is a little better quality.   I have heard that the quality on recent Das has gone down.   Personally, I consider Corsair to be overpriced.  Filco is decent as well.
Yeah, seeing both Falcon and Tony going after him was pretty emotional.
I teach at a "restorative justice" urban high school, no chance.
Honestly, it was far above expectations. I have yet to listen  to the other two, any thoughts on those? 
So, someone is only a demagogue if you personally disagree with them?
Those feet tho...
Personally I like [Robert Reich's hypothesis](http://robertreich.org/post/58082787864) on this, that political divisiveness and anger are tied with periods of high wealth inequality. 
Oh man, and I would've thought that was the limit of dystopia, turns out there's way more ridiculousness out there in this cycle.
Is it legal to use scaped data for my apps? 
nothing earns grandma's respect like telling a sports team to go kill themselves...?????
People seem to be saying amyl nitrites but I can't comment, I've never tried them.
The beach in Victoria Cove gets washed away in winter months making it much smaller. In the summer the currents deposits more sand to the beach making that area accessible again.

In my experience it's better to be honest upfront. Logically speaking, is it not better that you receive a job offer from an employer who is fully aware of and willing to adapt to your condition?   Simply tick the hidden disability box (should this apply to you) and offer some transparency about how it limits you and any medication you take. Any employer worth their salt will not discount you based on this alone and, honestly, you don't want to deal with a workplace that simply doesn't care and can't be bothered to adapt for you. It makes subsequent meetings with HR ten times easier as well. 
Thanks, rooting for you too!
Thanks for the badass answer, true entbro :)
Agreed. Most iFunny stuff isn't even funny, it's just salty hate
&gt; Thats literally Canelo's style  except its literally the reverse of Canelo's style.  His chin, and counterpunching gave the win over Cotto, not outboxing Cotto, which he arguably didn't do.  His opponents lose points through his ability to walk through their punches. Likewise, when was the last time you saw Canelo fight on the back foot? Lara? Cotto? Nope, neither of those.  Like GGG, it is very rare to see Canelo on the back foot.  I think there was 1-2 rounds where Canelo was backstepping from Floyd, for example.  I remember it because it was so rare/confusing. :D
How have the Mexicans performed this season? And also the team?
They might. So they can hide from *even bigger* fish.  It's also a good reason why humans shouldn't be sending radiowaves out into space. Changes are more likely if someone does come knocking it's because they have bad things planned.  Fermi Paradox is pretty scary.
[/u/AndrewFr1234 /u/gorok1089 /u/Keytium]   In the Ashwoods, the heroes gathered up to plan their attack. Kalina and Ellion were sitting together on a rock, and right next to them the Ashguard. Siprum was sitting on the ground with his legs crossed, while Narum and Spera stood beside him. Behind them, Metus was cowering in the shadow of the ashen trees. In the middle of the circle stood Kellinar who, as the leader of the party, spoke first.   “We need to think of a plan of attack. The Necromancer we’re challenging is ver-”   He was cut off by Narum   “LET’S JUST GET IN THERE AND BASH THEIR SKULLS INSIDE OUT”   Siprum grabbed her by the shoulder firmly.   “Let him speak. This is important.”   Narum almost bashed *Siprum’s* skull, but then she calmed down and listened.   “As I was saying… The Necromancer we’re going to fight is incredibly powerful and, more importantly, is holding Mor’inon hostage. She is the goal of this operation. **Not the necromancer**. He comes second, and so do the wards preventing Godly intervention. She is our top priority. She must be saved at all costs.” “The Necromancer, Ilafin, can set in motion his ritual prematurely, raising a huge army of restless dead and *killing* Mor’inon in the process. This **MUST** be avoided. For this reason, Narum” - he gave her a disappointed look - “a full frontal attack should be avoided, as it might tip him off of our presence and scare him”   Kellinar paused to look at each member of the party.   “Now, we must think of an effective plan that will allow us to either dispatch the front guard or to sneak in”   Ellion stood up.   “If I may, I’d like to play something before we get onto that”   Kellinar stiffened, then smiled with relief.   “Sure, Ellion, thank you”   Ellion played a powerful ballad, of heroes who faced impossible enemies and emerged victorious. This inspired the party. After he was finished, Kalina put a hand on his shoulder.   “**That was wonderful, Ellion. Now though we really need to plan…**”  ___  The Restless Dead were patrolling around the Citadel, While a good force of them were manning its walls.   Suddenly, from the woods, a melodic cry was heard. It sounded like multiple different songbirds were singing together a beautiful melody, but was at the same time somewhat out of tune, annoyingly so.   A Group of Restless Dead rushed to check the source of the noise, only  to find Ellion cheerfully screaming at the top of his lungs. Before they could attack, though, Half of them set off a trap and fell in a pit of Iron spikes, while the other half was peppered by arrows and throwing daggers coming from all directions.   Other patrols came, and they were met with similar fate, as Siprum, Spera , Metus and Kellinar  made quick work of them with their arrows and daggers. Siprum’s traps worked flawlessly too. Then, suddenly, a large battalion made of the last patrols came through the woods, quicker than any before, and rushed Ellion. The Archers did their best to protect him, but this time they were simply too many. Ellion was struck, and with a loud moan the music stopped. The undead who hit him could almost show glimpses of pleasure, but, with a terrifying roar that came from behind the unconscious bard, he was instantly struck by a massive beam of light, alongside the rest of the battalion. Nothing remained but cinders.   Kalina appeared beside him.   “**I told you not to act as bait dammit!**”   “**SPERA! HERE! NOW!**” - then she disappeared again.   As the Allfather’s daughter rushed to heal Ellion, her sister and Kellinar looked up at the Citadel. The Undead within were now on guard, though they were still unaware of what had happened or what the origin of the song was.   Then, suddenly, all the watchtowers on each corner of the citadel started getting ravaged by the Impure Smallptehas that haunted the dreams of all Undalean farmers. The nightmares made quick work of the watchmen, but were eventually dispatched by the reinforcements. That came from the walls.   This was their chance. A huge terrifying snake appeared in the center of the Citadel, with Metus riding on top of it, and around it the whole party was assembled. Kalina was panting for the effort but was still holding strong.   The remaining Restless Undead rushed to the inner courtyard to kill the intruders and protect the entrance of the Undercroft, and they were met by Narum **smiting** away, Kellinar crushing them with his warhammer and Shuedoth who sliced them up with his wings, followed by Yolunda blasting at the survivors. Metus drove his mount into the fray, eating its way to the last of their ranks. Meanwhile, Siprum was firing away from up above, Yaldia was dashing around with beams of light and Kalina was protecting Spera and Ellion, who was conscious again, yet still rather battered.   The Restless dead crumbled under the divine powers of the Demigods and the party gathered again to reorganise.   ___   “**ELLION!**” - Kalina rushed to him while he was recovering his strength - “**ARE YOU ALRIGHT?**”   “Yes, Darling, nothing to worry about. Spera is an excellent healer.”  ___  Meanwhile, Metus was recovering his summons   “I’m gonna send you back to the Beyond for now, Fidelis” - smiled Metus while stroking the snake’s scales -”I’ll see you there, I guess”   “STOP NAMING NIGHTMARES!” - shouted Narum.   “Only when you stop ‘redesigning’ your battle standards”   “Grrr”  ___  Eventually, they found the entrance to the  Undercroft and gathered around it, slightly refreshed and ready to move on
You probably got softbanned for some reason.
Disagree, family members benefit from being in the family. Parents pay for the kids stuff, education, etc. Kids do chores, and depending on the family they'll regularly visit and look after the parents when they become adults. The parents also pass their values and legacy along through their children.  Even in an extended family, you get people to hang out with a few times a year.
It's not so linear like that...  Thanks for your opinion non the less. Im going to focus on study instead of waisting my time trying to explain why I did not study. (IM not being rude, I just dont see the point of having this discussion) Anyway Have a nice day and thanks for your comments :)
Exp dailies are in Chaldea gate. Only do the 40 ap one btw.
When you overlook(v.) a project, you have oversight(n.) of that project.  When you overlooked(v.) someone's mistakes, you didn't see them.
That's subjective. Early FT is pretty good. It only becomes shit during the GMG arc.  Besides that, the guy just wanted to know similar anime, which FT undeniably is
They were shot with tranqs in their necks.  I thought the same as you that Diggle just killed two innocent drivers, replayed the scene again, and saw the darts in the neck. Doesn't explain instant acting tranqs but w/e, it's the same episode that had Felicity hack a complete background profile in 2 mouse clicks
This Check Cash Centre thing sounds horrendous and predatory. I had never heard of it before.
Yeah, antibiotics are def the bottleneck here.
&gt;It's a bit daft to call one if it's 60-40, because that's a very substantial amount of Scots who voted Leave and so are happy with the decision.  Anything above a 55-45 split is 'decisive' and 'overwhelming', so I imagine anything over 55% for Remain in Scotland would be seen as the 'settled will' of the Scottish people, meaning another referendum would be necessary. 
Does this mean I'm finally getting the hang of the game if I can (typically) do this sort of thing? :P   Alternative, "I'm gonna stand here and make this my patch of dirt, and you dirty Bugs|Borgs|Squid are gonna take it off my cold dead hands!" loadout. Due to the unknown time you'll need to be there, this avoids limited supply strats.  * Weapon - Paragon, Justice, Breaker or Supressor.  * Perk - Strat priority. Because you want a lot of firepower in short repeatable bursts. * Strat 1 - Ammo * Strat 2 - Strafing run * Strat 3 - Railcannon or heavy airstrike * Strat 4 - Static field or Napalm  Tactic: Find a defendable area, with at least one wall to protect you. Set up napalm and static field to cover directions (making sure to kill whatever's on the far side of the napalm on a regular basis!) and simply hold your ground.  Bringing a second person? Have them pack...  * Weapon - The opposite of you - if you have a shotgun, they bring an AR and vice versa. * Perk - Strat priority again * Strat 1 - Recoilless Rifle (but you take the pack) * Strat 2 - Resupply pack (they take all the ammo, you resupply from them) * Strat 3 - Napalm or static field. * Strat 4 - Laser strike or Railcannon  Two people make it more interesting as you need to move as a cohesive group. P1 needs to pay attention to P2's requirements for the RR and pack, reloading or calling down ammo as need be. Two sets of area denial means you can overlap and/or extend your area denial.  What's that? Another Helldiver has entered the area? FOR LIBERTEA! They should be armed with...  * Weapon - If their aim is true, railgun. If not, another AR or Shotgun (even the trident is OK by this point). * Perk - Strat priority. Seriously OP. * Strat 1 - Angel * Strat 2 - Obliterator, or one of the  mortar weapons. Rain death upon trapped foes. * Strat 3 - Railcannon or heavy airstrike * Strat 4 - Your choice, but ammo if using ammo weapons is good.  The third person starts to reach diminishing returns. A general purpose role here with some light healing and general utility starts to make sense as a support player.

Setting them up for using the x,y lengths of a room, how to get specific values based on an objects locations (Like which array box it's in), and how to adjust a path based on an object the array line collides with, etc.  I have no idea how to use arrays aside from how they work in theory.

Well, I hate to say it but any interest I had with GO initially is quickly draining seeing all of these gameplay videos. 
TIL that icecream tastes better after a bath.  They didn't even bother showing what happened in the haunted house?  Dropped.  I wonder which version of Inukai was the guy's type.
Green Egret goes up to the carts and grabs a little bit of everything, apparently not being a picky eater. Despite the fact that she didn't take large portions, she still has a towering mound of food once she is complete.  She then begins grabbing the food with her hands and quickly shoving it underneath her mask, barely giving herself time to chew, let alone swallow, before the next load is shoveled in. This is done with great speed and dexterity and and obviously practiced hand, in order to prevent anyone from seeing under her mask while eating. She finishes off her entire plate within minutes.
While there was a lot of grief (IMO most quite justified) given to Frontier for releasing Elite Dangerous with a fraction of the (originally) planned features it was at least released and it keeps getting better as they add more and more features to it. I can't help but think that's a better way to do things than keep adding features and have the release date sliding further and further away.

YES!!! :D
Not cheesy, this is the truth.

Yeah it was the most serious/emotional scene of that movie (for me) up until that happened. I mean, fairly funny but kinda' ruined the moment. I guess Marvel don't like getting tooooo serious or dark.

Bot games have 0 overall effect on MMR.  Does this make 4v5 games fun to play? No it does not. The alarming frequency of leavers in this game (had them in 2 out of 4 games the other day) generates a very unpalatable experience. There is 0 grounds to say otherwise. As such your "call of bullshit" is bullshit.
Did I just watch the Chica show for 10 minutes in anticipation of this game?

Okay.
I have faith in the developers being able to tell premeditated teamers from randoms. I hope something happens to people falsely accusing because they are the toxic ones in the community. Btw you're also at 4:25 in the video with a double kill, don't know if you saw that part ;)

It is 2012. It was a free datacenter license and I am a broke college student.  I'm so broke I bought a $25 ikea table to mount it on. 
&gt; ...did this too.  I think most games have tried this in one way or another.  There's no shortage of people who report bots and hackers.  Novel idea to reward them though. The bigger problem is verifying it is actually a bot/hack to be sure there's no mistakes.  With a bounty being offered I think their executioners are gonna be worked pretty hard to sort them out.  Obviously some are very simple to get evidence and convict but I wanna see how they manage the grey areas and falses.  *That* will be the test of their methods.
So the name Julia Anne can be shortened?

Thank you!
The same character? (as in same name and story). If so, it might be a bit weird for DM's and other players, but could also be really cool. The various campaigns could probably take place at different points in this guy's life, so he'd get older in each succeeding campaign, and always have awesome stories to tell about his previous adventuring friends.  If you just like playing mages, and that's the only thing that's the 'same' about each character, then I highly doubt DM's and PC's would have much of a problem unless they were trying to run a very specific type of campaign in which a mage would be a hindrance.
Wait, Fox is a good matchup!?
and how much did that cost?
The worst--or best--possible character to have one gets their own harem. How does it go?

Already bought things from mace. Mace only does clothing. 
i'm saying there's no reason to think that every single event that happens in the real world also happens exactly the same in a clearly fictional universe. Sure, the first Iron Man is during the war on terror, but there are allusions to the Ten Rings funding the terrorists and of course we know Hydra has been plotting its return ever since the end of WW2 so they have probably been responsible for lots of terrible actions (winter soldier) throughout the course of MCU history. Clearly this universe has an alternate history than ours
I'd be surprised if they felt anything more than feeling a little off. Most people don't get high their first times, even off edibles. Just be careful next time they should be fine, if anything let them take a nice long nap 
And they rot. You just wait them out until the flesh slides off their bones and they can no longer move; or even sooner, wait until their eyes rot out and they can no longer sense anything to pursue.

Without indulging you, or insulting your intelligence by explaining to you why I make the claims I do, I want to let you know that your lack of empathy, and your tendency to argue over philosophical intricacies in a thread about a rape, and denial of (what should be) a guaranteed human right is disgusting, and frankly characteristic of a sociopath.  This type of comment always depresses me as much as the original article does.  No matter how horrible the subject, there will always be equally horrible people arguing over moot things in the comments, trying to find even the smallest flaw in someone's comment so that they can analyze and pick it apart, with no regard for the subject at hand.  I mean look, &gt; We are talking about a construct invented by humans, for humans.  You're talking about the **rape** of an innocent person during an **epileptic fit**, being denied proper medical care.  And you're here for what?  Because you get some sort of satisfaction arguing with people who are here to empathize? Go on now, tell me about how I'm using appeals ad hominem.  Tell me about how my point is moot because I'm emotional.  Move on to the next thread, where people dare to feel something for another human being, so that you can tell them why they're wrong, and that their emotions can be explained away by logic.  
Backline is shambolic. Doesn't look like it was the best time to trade a defender.
Sounds like you missed the VE session...  2.5 hours, and people still testing?  Sounds like they were doing the zero to hero sittings.  Next time, show up on time, or call ahead to let them know you'll be later, and ask if it's ok.
Quick google search brings up this:  http://www.scotsman.com/news/robert-dobbie-obituary-1-3137599  Hope you find your answers, and this isn't it. 
So do get the certificates as needed. Depends on how many beans you cash in per day. Gear =\= skill. Skill has always been better than gear in games like this. As long as your AP is like above 500 and you are all top players you shouldn't lose to 600 ap pve scrubs who suck at pvp. Just put crit defense on your soul shields and prioritize defense crit pieces after you are accuracy capped. The BiS PvP soul shield is naksun which you can do with 500 AP.

Brian Burke expressing exactly how we feel about commercial breaks.
ffs I knew it.
I actually think that the shrine in the untended graves is the "real" one. Everyone left, even the blacksmith, leaving behind his hammer. When we place all the lords on their thrones, the illusion is broken, and we exit the shrine to see Lothric destroyed. It would make sense, if the actual shrine is under Lothric castle. Also the reason the old merchant looks like a fire keeper from ds2 and sells Artorias's armor (probably a hint to the abyss spreading) is still unknown to me. 
I hope they really give us cake...

There's plenty of precedent in other works for tinker-style superheroes whose only innate power is gadgeteering genius. He could have made himself into one of those, if he hadn't decided to murder a shitload of people instead. That's on him.  Though I do think the movie was needlessly critical of the idea of making his devices available to the public. His advertising methods were obviously fucked up and needed to be stopped, but there was nothing wrong with the end goal.

So I'm super late to this thread, but I just discovered ZileanMains so yeah. I also play in high plat. The build I usually go is 1) ap support item 2) sightstone 3) mikael's crucible 4) boots of swiftness 5&amp;6) zekes/locket/banner/zz'rot/frozen heart depending on the situation.   The reason I do this is because Mikael's gives cdr, mana regen, and a sweet active to save your adc. Now obviously the order I buy them in depends on the situation. If I'm getting rekt sometimes I rush frozen or locket, but a usual safe game works pretty well like this and you become extremely helpful to the team.

And that's it....
J.One was also in 3Chongsa so this will be his 5th group name.

And your DOB, and a county you lived in, and an address.  Combine that with other data, and it is more than enough to steal your identity.
I thought it was something about E3
"So we need a larger drill?!"
Are there regular screenshots with standard settings? It looks absolutely gorgeous with renders but I find it hard to picture the landscape from a player's perspective.
I mean by saying stfu you instantly added to the toxicity of the game. Maybe if you hadn't ran your mouth like your team maybe you wouldn't be writing this qq post 
Forever.
Who? 
IT'S 8, GET THIS GOING
Lol. If you do a history search of this sub I think you'll find a whole bunch of these posts, all with lots of people commenting that it happens to them, too. Seems to be very common and no one knows why!
No no no, take Cuba by all means! Get that sugarcane! Cuba libre!
I never said his analysis was horrible just his prediction. Sometimes the way he speaks about LoL it just doesn't look like he has the same passion as he had before. You can also tell the way he speaks about Lol that he doesn't watch any games outside of EU or NA. Which is okay because he is very intelligent when it comes to other Esports games and it would devote a lot of time to watch everything. I love his thoughts on LoL, but his content for it has been going down for a while IMO. 
Under all modern operating systems, when a process terminates all of its resources are relinquished.  There's no way for a process to consume memory after it has terminated, so memory leaks are about dealing with resources while your program runs, not after it finishes.  For simple trivial programs, it might not really matter.  There's a school of thought that says you shouldn't worry about explicitly freeing memory if you're writing a short-lived program that's about to exit anyway.  But there are counterpoints to that philosophy.  For one thing, many programs don't have that luxury.  In particular, libraries can't assume they will be used in a short-lived program, so they must always take care to do accurate memory accounting.  And it's not uncommon to start out writing a program and then turn around and later decide that it's so useful it needs to be turned into a library so that the functionality can be reused in other contexts.  But if you never bothered to manage memory, under the assumption that you were writing a short-lived program and not a library, then you have a ton of work on your hands; you may have to completely rethink the entire foundation of your code.  Certain classes of programs are not short-lived, like servers.  When writing code that's going to run for a long time, it's absolutely essential to not leak memory, because even small leaks will add up to significant amounts of wasted memory as your program runs for weeks or months.  And then there's the issue with tools like valgrind which can be used to diagnose all kinds of errors, including leaks.  Again, if you write code that intentionally leaks, that's a defensible standpoint under certain circumstances, but it also means you make it a lot harder to use these tools, because they will light up with thousands of alerts to memory leaks, drowning out the actual problems that you were trying to find.  Especially as a beginner you need to learn the proper discipline of how to manage memory.  You can always choose to intentionally leak if you've made a careful analysis, but you can't do the reverse — if you've developed shit habits of never properly dealing with memory then you won't be able to write libraries or servers or all kinds of other programs.

&gt;I guess I could have guessed to 15 % when I did the math in my head reading articles. R&amp;D are not the only things a company would invest in; buying new materials, expanding operations, what have you are all possible outlets for a company to spend their revenue on.  &gt;Invest 100 % of that corporate handout  I mean, the fact that you would consider the government taking less money from a company as a corporate handout means we'll probably just agree to disagree. &gt;Invest 100 % of that corporate handout in governmental programs You're right, and I'll up the ante, in that the government should probably take over all the aspects of industrial production. It will lower your costs and have far more money toward the American workforce and into the consumer economy! Problem solved.
i love this xD
jesus. blueballs much?
I agree, but this logic does not follow through with the rest of smite. You look at say Appollo or Houyi or a few other hunters who are extremely strong late game but pay no price for it early or mid. Thanatos being able to execute tanks late game I think makes up for his short comings. 
What does voltage have to do with anything? 
I'm surprised he wasn't drafted
I had a pot of cold water on the bench beside me at work...im a chef.  My boss walked behind me and kind of bumped me while I was looking up a recipe so i dropped it in the pot.  Ive never seen someone so freaked out and apologetic in my life....he said hed buy me a new one next pay day.  I reached my hand in the pot and continued to search for the recipe while the phone was still under water.   Hilarious as hell.
There are quite a few NGOs that treat jigger victims. Also, Jim lies and tells viewers hospitals won't treat people with jiggers which is BS (see video on my YouTube channel with CEO of Ahadi Trust). Jim is just the only one that videos and exploits the victims and makes $7-10,000/month from YouTube off them. Ahadi Trust was one of the first registered organizations in Kenya, and they're the largest. One of the volunteers that quit working for RUS has joined another small NGO and just started a Jigger Treatment sector. As soon as they're set up to receive donations, I'll help that person because I trust him. Corruption is not limited to RUS by any means... People are so poor over there, they'll do and say almost anything for a very small amount of money. While I was there, I heard a lot of stories that still give me chills!
AFAIK these are the ones used in the SC.
And they bring with them the tears of other teams.
Toyota's are far faster than they should be. It's boggling.

My life working retail. People come up to me. Why is this not working? I explain what the problem is to them. No that's not right the problem is something else.
