I always thought "why" would be answered one day by some form of "It had to be this way because of the essential consistency between all of the properties of existence."  Some kind of meta-circular recursive kind of self-reinforcing structure that couldn't possibly be any other way.  And then everything would make sense.  But possibly that is my own pet religion masquerading as a (possibly) reasonable possibility.  
Turn off your television. Cancel your cable. You've bought into the biggest crock of shit ever put before man. In case you haven't noticed programming suxx0rs and isn't improving. Prices are escalating. And for what? Flat Earth in 3D! Reality programming! 9 million police procedurals. The entertainment industry is as bankrupt as the mortgage and credit banking industry. And yet, if you'll just take a taste they'll promise you ecstasy for only a limited upcharge a month.  Bah!

As a non-snob but someone who enjoys wine and might be a [supertaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertaster) the wax (or even non-waxed) papercup would (and does) certainly add a scent (if not a flavor) to the wine that glass does not.  Dixie cups, those ubiquitous red and blue plastic party cups and many others have their own unique scent and one that doesn't belong in wine.

Nah, not my thing either. It's not social like booze, and doesn't get you up and doing things like speed, E, etc. It's just turning off, as far as I'm concerned, and I don't see the point.

I hear you. I purely hate the "Chimpy McDrunkard" school of name-calling, because it misidentifies the problem. But in the context of a discussion among folks who mostly agree, *not* correcting the usual "repubs" to "rethugs" misses an opportunity for minor venting. I don't talk or write like that in wider arenas.

But you can advocate that juries not be intimidated by a judicial procedure riddled with systemic bais as to burden and economic incentive as to defense that a procedure crafted with principles without peer has been reduced to a mockery-- what percentage of the time? Jury rights are a complicated issue and to imply the poster's reaction as 'unthinking' and defines the poster's being is a syllogism

upmodded for getting the tone of discourse just right.
The opposition to the HPV vaccination is the fear that vaccinations are not safe.  These certainly haven't been tested widely and there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to whether vaccinations are safe overall. I'm not saying they are unsafe, merely that there IS a reason for opposing it that has nothing to do with some insane theory that they want to punish their children for having fun.

I disagree strongly with your implication that SBC women want to be punished or treated as servants anymore than Scientologists do.  That's certainly what the Southern Baptists *teach*--James Dobson for example, teaches men that women like to be beaten because it makes them feel morally superior--but I don't accept it. Women who seek help from a SBC minister for domestic violence are generally "counseled" to go home and try to be more obedient so they won't get hit as much. That is ministerial abuse, period.  And what about the young girls, who are conditioned to this from toddlerhood? You really think they have a choice to decide if they want to be treated as servants or not?  You think it's not harmful to tell them that's all they are good for, and--if they happen to live in Ghana--raise them to believe that their survival is worthless?  &gt;you can get 9/10 psychologists/physicians to agree on that.  Please show me where 9/10 psychologists/physicians have agreed that Scientology does more emotional and physical harm than the SBC.

deeplyembedded is quite right that the Nazis called themselves socialist, but they were nowhere near the conventional definition of socialism. As with Stalin and communism, or Bush and freedom, a leader's advocacy of some ideal isn't worth a millionth of him actually implementing it.

This is one of those topics about which I can draw a fun parallel between the far right and far left. Who else here has noticed that the far left and far right are exactly alike when you look at gun control and teen pregnancy?  The far right believes that if everyone keeps their fun bits to themselves and doesn't indulge in any sex until they're married to someone, and ONLY have sex with that specific someone, STD's and unwanted pregnancy would be eliminated. For the most part, they're right -- there would still be a few cases of STD's transferred by other routes. However, this won't happen in the real world. Nobody's perfect, and people like to have sex. The far left is always quick to point out that this system only works in a perfect world where people don't have to worry about lust or temptation.  When it comes to gun control, the far left believes that outlawing firearms will stop all firearm related crime. After all, you can't use a firearm in a crime if you can't get one. They're largely correct -- if you could find a way to make all firearms illegal and dispose of them, there would be almost no gun crime. There would still be isolated cases of clever criminals fabricating firearms, and the inevitable gun missed by the ban/destruction sweep, but your average Joe Thug probably wouldn't have one. However, this isn't a perfect world, and there is just NO WAY to round up every firearm. Even if the US government could do it, there would be a thriving black market for illegally imported arms. Of course, the far right commonly points this out as a counter-example.  Both arguments are absurd, yet each side staunchly sticks with it.

Using groovy is premature. I would use Scala, which delivers all the benefits, has a syntax that's saner than Java's C legacy, and is at least one order of magnitude faster. The strength of Scala is that you *don't* have to dump out into icky Java to write inner loops. You can merrily metaprogram and write DSLs and functional code, and they'll whizz along regardless. It does the glue *and* the heavy lifting.
I love the symbolism.  To me it speaks of how the church symbolically kills off Jesus every year, only to bring him back to kill him again, year after year. And somehow chocolate bunnies have everything to do with it.   Genius
I think that basically comes down to maintaining healthy relationships.  Date people you respect and trust, and you won't have to worry about it.  And hey, if someone enjoys casual sex without a relationship attached, I certainly won't tell them it's wrong to think that.

Sigh. I dislike record companies as much as the next guy - but this is a sensationalist, incorrect headline.  The original French article says that Sony was running this company's software unlicensed on *four* servers.

The only one backing down is you. I've been begging you to have a discussion of the issues. You've refused repeatedly.  I present the challenge, now, for a fourth?

How many times can you run from this simple challenge? All I want you to do is back up your own claims.

No, I'm sorry, but the Christians that I know (a lot) ALL give the reason that getting the vaccine would allow/encourage their children to have sex. I have not heard a single person say that it is unsafe - I'm not saying no one does have that reason, but that is NOT the opposition I hear in the places that I live (east TN and VA.)  They don't *say* that it's for punishment, but they don't want their daughters to get it because they think the fear will prevent sex or the giving of the vaccine will encourage it.
Also, isn't there something about Dutch chocolate not being as beneficial? ie, IIRC, the Dutching process removes a bunch of the antioxidants or something.

Let me help you. Obvious abuse = sexual, physical or mental abuse. Obvious abuse does not equal things you disagree with them about. EDIT: And the reason for this - which both the intolerant right and the intolerant left have forgotten - is that if you are in the minority you still get to be FREE to do it your way in our country.  When you start mandating how others should do it you run the risk of being in the minority someday and finding yourself no longer free. It is just the same as when the religious right starts telling me I can't buy a beer on Sunday because of some BS reason - and they forget that they might not always be in the majority and they might find that THEIR freedom is infringed upon one day. I don't want to tell others how to educate their children on sex based on the latest study, which will likely be contradicted by another study in six months, and I don't want others telling me how to educate MY children on the subject. You educate your kids your way and I'll educate my kids my way.

Assuming birth control, a condom, and disease testing is used, the difference between the risks of abstinence and sex are vanishingly small.  I would also argue that you make an invalid generalization here: you mean to say that you and your friends were not mature enough to deal with having safe sex.  This is by no means true of all teenagers.  
Murdering pets is worse than using the color of religious authority to demand that women needlessly place themselves in life-threatening situations against their wish to survive? To brainwash them into believing that efforts to survive would be sinful and ungodly?  How many women's deaths does it take to equal the loss of one goldfish?
To some degree yes (friends are on Xbox Live too), but that's not entirely it.  I just think it's a more refined setup for online gaming, particularly with team games.  With deathmatch and similar gametypes, it's not a big deal, but in games that require strategy and teamwork, the fact that every 360 owner has a mic (unless they bought it used or don't use it) and that helps immensely.  Factor in that the friends list is accessible in-game and is far more intuitive in general and I just think it feels like a more 'complete' online package.

that is only one example of what you have taken out of context in my posts and responded to erroneously. and because you either can't or don't want to read what i've writeen, i agree, we aren't going to agree. however, if you can turn the reading comprehension on full blast, i think we can work through this.  &gt; Even if there were no codified laws, you co-existing with other people makes this impossible. There’s no way I would ever agree to be ruled by the moral standards you believe in, and eventually it would come to violence. You are not free to push your lifestyle on me, just as I am not free to push my values on you.  now what i said was that there are already laws to guard between one and another individual. i cannot to you and you cannot to me. these laws already exist. and i said it should be that way! however, what i do to me (do heroin by the wheelbarrow) is none of your or the government's business. the moment that someone crosses an individual barrier, they have broken a law that has legitimate place in a governmental structure. however, for those who are their own ward,  a governmental structure has no business dictating any behavior. advise, educate, if the electorate wants it, but treating everyone like criminals because a few people break legitimate laws (with or without legalized drugs) is nonsense.  &gt; unlike you, I think a more moderate, careful, and considered approach to drug legalization is more prudent than legalizing all drugs.  so who decides, and what are the guidelines? is cocaine legal? but heroin probably isn't, right? maybe heroin is, but you are only allowed to smoke it. orr....  can you show me any evidence that any measure of prevention is effective in any tangible way? maybe its out there everywhere and i'm just missing it.   if so, ok, i guess i'll have to reconsider. but...  i've always been of the impression that whatever drugs make it to a particular location is the amount of drugs that sell in a particular location. whatever it is thats selling, and legal or not.  bah. whatever. neither of us matter anyway.  i will say this: government is a good thing as long as its scope and venue are kept on an interpersonal level. that is, the government operates in the space between people, because it is the thing that binds those people together.   when government's decisions start to creep into personal freedom to provide desired goods and services it becomes a very bad thing, again, of course, wherever a good or service directly infringes on another individual (say some 7/11 owner was lacing the water with heroin), this is still a crime.  you've taken me so far out of context i can't even make a meaningful point. you have mis-characterized me and my argument repeatedly. in conclusion, i hate the internet.

Sounds like fun. We can't keep up all four topics right now, though, would you like to choose one for a detailed discussion?  In the meantime some thoughts in response to your thoughts:  **Fundamentalism** I would argue that there's no such thing as a fundamental atheist since the attribute that defines fundamentalist Christianity is their belief in a fundamental truth which cannot be altered or influenced. Atheists hold no facts to such a standard, and while their may be *extreme* atheists there surely isn't such a thing as an atheist that would deny God's existence if scientific experiment confirmed it.  In other words: the concept of "fundamental" atheism is mixed up and confused with "evangelical" atheism. In terms of atheism the distinction should be between [strong and weak](http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismquestions/a/strong_weak.htm) or atheist and agnostic, respectively.  To return to your question, though:  &gt; How certain should someone be of what they believe?  However certain they are, as the problem isn't with conviction but how it impacts your actions. Two people could be identically certain of their beliefs yet only one of them goes to an extreme (violence, for example) because of it.  **Indoctrination** It sounds like we agree that strong indoctrination (to the point of so-called brain washing) of a child is morally impermissible but some indoctrination is impossible to avoid. I agree with your conclusion: it's more important to teach children how to question and think critically than it is to "not indoctrinate."  **Creationism/I.D.** I'm not a scientist of any kind, either, and even if I was that wouldn't qualify me to know everything about evolution. In the world of science there isn't a field or arena that isn't impacted by the theory of evolution. To go any further, though, we have to get a few things out in the open:  1) Do you believe in the literal truth of the Bible (and in particular the stories of creation in Genesis)?  2) Does the truth or falsity of evolution disprove or prove the existence of God?  3) Are science and religion mutually exclusive?  4) Do you agree that Intelligent Design is no more than another name for religious creationism?
Is it me, or did I just read a five paragraph essay that sidestepped a very simple and direct question?

There's a fair difference between wishing somebody's loved ones get raped and actually going out and raping them.  One of these could justify killing, the other doesn't merit much past dirty looks and shouted insults.  See if you can figure out which is which.
Perhaps you missed the part where they murder you. In one case you're a servant which is terrible, in other case you're dead. It doesn't get much worse than that unless the scientologists piss on your grave, which I wouldn't rule out.

&gt; We need to demand, not just hope for, but demand an end to this silly "war".  100% agree.  If alcohol is legal, marijuana should be too.  &gt; Marijuana is used by free thinkers. It is not a destructive drug. People smoke, sit down with each other, and exchange ideas, concepts, and positive experiences.  This is the last thing that an oppressive society wants to happen.  Well, it's pretty easy to get a cup of coffee and exchange ideas.  It's also easy to exchange ideas on IRC with people in other countries.  I don't think the reason for outlawing marijuana is to prevent the free exchange of ideas.  I think the reason is brainwashing (remember DARE from elementary school? talk about propaganda...).  Everyone is taught "ALL DRUGS ARE BAD" from an early age.  Therefore, people think all drugs are bad.  In addition, "it's always been illegal, so why change now."  It's really stupid, but hey... people are stupid.

why should an employer try to make an IT department more attractive to women?  why just women?  why not each individual minority as well?  i mean hell, there may be a really good reason, but if someone isn't drawn to the profession, why try to coax them into it?  you may as well try and make the IT profession more attractive to sketch artists and carpenters, too.  i'm humbly interested in an honest response.

Maybe some of you can help me remember: I either read a book or saw a doc about a group of Antarctic explorers. They made camp on a small island and quickly ate all the penguins there. Pretty soon they realized they were going to starve, so part of the group went off to look for rescue, and the rest stayed at the camp. The ones who stayed ended up digging up the decaying penguin carcasses and eating what they could, and I remember one really wise person noted that "every group needs a scapegoat". In this case it was this one particular guy everyone hated and picked on. Ever since I've noticed this to be absolutely true, whether in bands, restaurant employment, families, whatever. I just wish I could remember where I saw or read that!
Now there is an example of classic confusion.
No it wouldn't.  I can easily provide thousands and thousands of provably intelligent people (more intelligent than you or me) that believe in God. It is unknowable, unprovable and impossible to disprove.  You can make intelligent arguments for and against it.  It isn't part of an intelligence test. An intelligence test would test for things you CAN prove true or false.

Prison is a bad idea in the first place, an extension of the dungeons European tyrants used to keep political prisoners in.  As punishment, it never fits the crime. For some crimes it's too lenient, for most it's too harsh. It doesn't rehabilitate. It doesn't satisfy justice. It doesn't compensate the victim, nor does it let prisoners compensate their victims. Wherever there is a prison, there is nothing useful; just a place where humanity is abused, and a useful tool of the state. Adding insult to injury, it is the peaceful victims of crimes who must pay for the upkeep and maintenance of these blights.  There have been plenty of societies that had no prisons, and they were probably better off for it.
I used to like the guy, but man, that's just selling your soul.
The Godfather of modern capitalism, Milton Friedman, believed that unregulated markets were the key to economic growth. Any interference by the government would be a distortion to the purity of the market, and a sure route to economic catastrophe. Friedman argued with religious passion that capitalism was the best system we had, and his influence has molded economic policy in the U.S and Britain for the last 30 years.

As I said, constructivists would, as I understand it, view these sorts of arguments in askence. As far as proof&lt;-&gt;program stuff, isn't there something about call/cc having type equivalent to pierce's law, so basically that brings in double negation elimination and "full power" logic? EDIT: usefulness, sure. I was simply saying that depending on _which_ mathematicians you put together in a room, the amount of (dis)agreement on this matter may vary. :)

The state and federal government can't prosecute Scientologists for homicide by handgun? I find that extremely hard to believe. If Scientologists are breaking the law, then they should be prosecuted. But it's not fair to ban the entire religion for being harmful and dangerous unless you ban all the other harmful and dangerous religions.   How many murders have been inspired by Islam? Catholicism? And what do you call the holy war the evangelicals are calling for in Iraq and Iran? You really think that no one is dying from that? 
Ah, yes, it's the atheists that are scared of religion. And all this time I thought the Christian Right was claiming atheists were the scourge of society, aren't citizens, are going to burn in hell and are really just angry at somebody else's fantasies.

All sci fi geeks are honor bound to point out the flip side to the "optimism" coin.  I'll reread Gibson anyday...He refers to it as the "Gee whiz Willy Lee rocket" era.  Or Gernsbackian.  Or whatever you'd like to call it.  I guess it really does depend on the era in which you came of age.  Much of what I grew up on is dystopian or pessimist, with a few notable exceptions (Orson Scott Card being a notable one).  Actually, I'm reading Iain Banks new one, Matter, which as a Culture novel, is pretty utopian.  Superb material, really.

I read this really good book "Ancient Mysteries" I think it was called, it looked at legends and bible stories through the lens of science. If you read it you'll find a convincing argument that many of the Bible's stories *do* have an origin in truth.  The bible's root word biblio means "book". It was *the* book, and for millenia that's really what it was to followers of Abraham. If some important shit happened there was only one place to put it to ensure the knowledge would pass down. If you're Abrahamic by blood, these stories are literally the voices of your ancestors. Certainly much has been lost or perverted over time, but it's still one of the best links to that *very real* time that we have. I don't think we should take the Bible as absolute truth, but there is definitely a very real story behind many of the Bible's stories, it's one of the oldest "history books" we have, and hell, it's only a little more biased than the ones we get at school.  If you need any more proof, so many of the stories are either simply too bizarre to make up from whole cloth(Jesus and the lazy tree) or otherwise too mundane and meaningless to bother writing down if it wasn't at least based in truth(The very human author is the only one who cares who begat so-and-so and what everyone's kids are up to).   He also convinced me he had figured out where and what "Atlantis" truly was in his book, *biig disappointment*  actually, but it's pretty much the only theory that fits with the facts, if you disregard Plato's story as a lunatic rant. You can still go and see "Atlas' Throne". Of course, the name "Atlantis" comes from Atlas, not the Atlantic Ocean. The home of the god Atlas is almost certainly "Atlantis" and almost certainly not some super-advanced civilization.

Well, I'm fairly agnostic and I wouldn't give my 11 year old daughter (hypothetical - I actually have a 9 month old son) the HPV vaccine yet. I'll let other parents play guineau pig with that one for a few more years. It has nothing to do with religion or whether it would reduce the disincentive to have sex.  It has everything to do with my distrust of the CDC and WHO and their motives - which I think are good in the BIG PICTURE, but sometimes cause harm in individual small picture cases. I'm worried about ONE KID - not the whole world  - so I have different (although sometimes overlapping) concerns.

Sex education is just that. Educating children about the mechanics and ways of human sexuality. It is FACTUALLY based. That you think it is anything but speaks volumes to your mindset. The answer is always more education. Your ability to shelter your children from education should not, in fact, be an impediment to their education. They aren't your property. You are merely their guardians.

Concepts are supposed to set constraints on e.g. inputs. For example in a language that doesn't have builtin lessthan (&lt;) operator, your code would look like (using type classes that are almost like concepts):   class &lt; a where (&lt;):: a a -&gt; Bool  instance &lt; Int where (&lt;) a b = ...   min:: [a] -&gt; a  | &lt; a  min [] = abort "Empty list, not defined"  min [a] = a  min [a:tail] = let b = min tail in if (a &lt; b) a b   result = min [7, 51, 14, 3]  Looks almost the same in Haskell or C++0x. D doesn't have concepts, but I guess you could somehow mimic part of the functionality with templates or mixins. But as we can all see, it's probably going to be pretty unreadable.

I never heard of that. It could have happened but it seems a bit harsh. When I was in high school I got:  * Detailed information about all sorts of drugs.  * Pros/Cons, what happens to you on short/long term.  * What does it look like (including real samples).   It all seemed to be pretty detailed and balanced. We didn't get a moral-highpoint "Don't do drugs" talk but a somewhat balanced discussion.  There's a TV show here called "Spuiten and slikken" (translation: inject and swallow) where they actually try things all sorts of drugs live on tv aimed at young people (they also do things like sex-education and all sorts of controversial stuff, pretty graphic). I remember an episode where the all hosts were high on a different drug, pretty funny stuff. Needless to say, the current conservative administration isn't very happy about this show :D.
I thought this only applied in the 70s when Bath houses were popular.  And also, I have to question if there is a signifigant difference in AIDS occurances between Homo and Heterosexual victims. I can beleive that anal sex is more vunerable than vaginal sex, but I wonder if vaginal sex is still vunerable enough for the mechanical difference to be relavent.  I.E. If the probability of getting AIDS through gay sex is %300 and only %100 with heterosexuals, then you would still be screwed. (Unintentional pun. Yea.)

&gt; A written transcript reported in a trial covered on the smoking gun website does nothing for the credibility factor  Please explain to me what evidence would be required to demonstrate to you that your claim (twice stated) that the CVR of flight 93 was not found is false. Clearly giving you a picture and the transcript wasn't good enough.  How about a news story from 11/15/01? Also faked by the government?  http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20010915blackbox0915p3.asp   Or maybe the story from the families listening to the tapes, from 2002?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A12262-2002Apr18  Maybe the government got all those families to lie about this? Or maybe they were able to fake all the families too?  At some point your ability to deny the evidence has to cease, right?  &gt; I am not a "truther" as you are so quick to label me  I apologize for labeling you something you find offensive. That being said, you've repeated many oft-repeated truther myths that are known to be false.   &gt; I have learned not to try to change those people's minds who are not receptive to the science aspect of 9/11.  I, unfortunately, haven't learned that, yet. I argue with people like that all the time: the truthers. I'm fairly certain that's not the group you were thinking of, though. My view of the vast majority of truthers is that they only give lip service to the idea of science, and use the term to give their psuedoscientific claims merit.  I'd love to discuss the so-called science behind the 9/11 conspiracy theories. I'm often begging reddit conspiracy theorists to provide me some science, and with one exception, every single one of them has failed to even engage in the discussion.  &gt; If bin Laden is responsible for 9/11, why has the FBI never charged him or included 9/11 with his other charges?  I know you don't want me to answer the question, but luckily, "they" already have.  First, the FBI doesn't charge anyone with anything. The reason 9/11 isn't on the WANTED posted is precisely because he hasn't been charged.  The real question I presume you care about is why the DOJ hasn't charged Bin Ladin. They've also answered this.   The reason Bin Laden hasn't been charged with  the terrorists attack of 9/11 is partially because Bin Laden isn't directly and personally "responsible". Personal responsibility falls mostly with the hijackers and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad (and others).   See here:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7239099.stm   Bin Ladin's role is far less clear and the evidence linking him, personally, and directly to 9/11 isn't "hard" (ie, it's confession tapes w/ unknown chain of custody, and so on).  There are some other legal mumbo-jumbo reasons.  Some explanation:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700687.html  http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/09/47109  There are others but I've spent enough time on this post.
&gt; When brainwashed from childhood that they'll go to Hell if they disobey? Hardly. Haven't you ever heard of authority rape? This is much, much worse. brainwashed... and they live, much better than being dead. &gt; No rules? The state and federal government can't prosecute Scientologists for homicide by handgun? I find that extremely hard to believe. Scientologists are all about controling the legal system and any government institutions in order to hide any wrongdoings. Take a look at the Clearwater police which are [controlled by Scientologists](http://www.sptimes.com/News/032201/Opinion/Police_work_for_Scien.shtml).  How are you going to prosecute if the DA is enforcing fair game? CoS critics in Clearwater are already targetted by the police. You realize that there are court cases showing that Scientologists have infiltrated the IRS and that it is a fact that their policy is to take hold of government to pursue their interests.

When I autologin, I don't want to be asked for a password, and they seem to think I'm unreasonable. Drives me batty.
You're not an asshole, just wrong.  Partners come in all shapes and size, and all levels of self-moistening.  Obviously - generally - the wetter your partner the more turned-on they are, but this is a *strictly relative value*.  In other words, you can compare level of lubrication across time, but not between partners.  &gt; That hasn't been my experience...  I'd advise getting some more experience before aspiring to hold strong opinions, personally... ;p

I'm connecting to a wep-128 bit network (not mine to mess with)  I enter the obnoxiously long key and if I get it wrong, the connect just pretends to have signal, but I get no network connectivity.  (Why is it showing bars if I can't actually reach the gateway?) Anyway, at that point, if i choose that same wireless network from the popup menu in the notification area, it won't ask for a new wep key.  Just uses the original that didn't work to begin with.
I knew I would be downvoted for that, but you are missing the point. I figured most people would. In almost any circumstance a person can maim an individual. Yes, even against many. The point was that you would likely be killed for doing so. Usually the rapist tells you as much.  In no way was I blaming a victim. I am pointing out the problem here, and you, unfortunately are part of it. Yes, in almost every instance of rape, male or female, the person being raped could continue to fight indefintely. The problem is what you say, and how on a base level, the reaction is "yes, I could fight, at least enough to make sex nearly immpossible".  By saying that a person could never fight off a rapist, you dodge the real reason the people are "judging" male victims of rape.  They chose life over death.
What happened to people on the left supporting the environmentalist idea of using everything you can when you kill an animal? We in America kill millions of cats, would that somehow be worse if we put them to good use, rather than just burning them?

Sort of.  The investigation apparently was instigated by a United States Forrest Service official who found it suspicious that they defendant wanted privacy on his land; the chopper came from the Army National Guard.  What they were doing, however bizarre, actually was legal as a matter of US constitutional law, inasmuch as it was not a search.  (The ruling is that it violated the Vermont Constitution).  The part that's funny, if you read the ruling, is that these guys apparently lied brazenly in the trial court about the altitude of the helicopter.  The ruling says they told the court the chopper was at 500 feet, but the court found that was "not credible" -- a term known in less polite circles as something between wishful thinking and perjury -- and that the chopper was barely off the ground.  We actually have some really good and honest cops in this neck of the woods, but it's a real tribute to the drug war that some of our most elite and respected law enforcement officers feel compelled to lie under oath about somebody's stupid weed farm.

Sorry, that was the exact situation.  As stated in the post, it had been awhile since I used ruby.  As NOT stated in the post, I had trying to learn AWK to help solve the specific problem, which probably didn't help.  Also, it was a sunday evening, which also reduces my mental capacity.

Here's the last thing I heard from my mother that disturbed me:  We had just arrived back at her house after we went out to eat and I looked up in the sky and pointed out Orion (the only constellation I can pick out with any regularity) and mentioned a bit of trivia about it I remembered from a high school astronomy class:  "Some people say that the two stars there below the belt are Orion's dagger.  Some other people say it's his penis, but I don't buy it."  To which my mom replied "Unless he's Ron Jeremy."  Awkward silence followed.
I think those polls are based on the popular vote and don't take electoral votes into account.

I disagree with the CoS, they label me an SP and try to kill me, do I have a choice? Some white people come to Africa and talk about something ridiculous, I refuse the lemonade and go on my way. &gt; That's also the policy of the Christian Dominionist movement. Do we ban them too? So the Dominionists control communities and kill those who disagree with them, and have had court cases establishing these facts? I can get a judge's quote about fair game. Can I get a quote from a judge lambasting dominionists?
I like Python quite a bit, but I'm struck by how reminiscent the arguments against Ruby's dynamic behavior are to the justifications for Java vs. languages like Python. In both cases the justification often articulated is that "programmers will screw it up" if more power is provided. One would think that a good set of tests would pretty well minimize this problem.

We could stop trading with China. The only problem is that we still owe them about $300 trillion US dollars. If them dump US dollar, we are in deep shit. But if we continue to trade with them. We will owe them $400 trillion US dollars pretty soon. So either way we loss. The only way to get back the money is to invade China, like what we did to Iraqi's.
Octopi are muscular hydrostats. This means that their muscles serve as a skeleton, allowing them to squeeze through spaces, well, about an inch in diameter.  The most amazing part about octopi, in my opinion, is their incredible intelligence and their ability to control their arms using their outer neurons, or ganglionic mass. They have pre programmed searching patterns that their arms follow until something of interest is found, when the main brain takes over. Completely fascinating.   They are the most intelligent invertebrates, meaning that their brains evolved completely separately from the brains of humans and other mammals. We can evaluate their intelligence, but there is zero chance of understanding it. The way they think is 100% alien to us, they might as well be little green men.

It's not about making it attractive to women, it's about not getting discounted BECAUSE you're a woman.   You honestly have no idea how many times I've been discounted, flat out patted on the head by IT "professionals" because of my gender. Why would anyone want to work in an environment where they're given no respect, no responsibility, and overruled every time they turn around solely due to their gender?  I certainly didn't; I moved on to bigger and better things, and found employers that did treat me as an equal, but it took work. And every time I change jobs, I have to re-earn the respect of colleagues who'd give it to me automatically if I was born male. It's not fun, but it's the reality of working in a male-dominated field.

Am I the only one noticing the hypocrisy in criticizing china for occupying some province that has traditionally been part of china by Americans, when their own country keeps invading country after country?

&gt;As much as I dislike them, they're nothing compared to the CoS.  Muslims killed 3000 people one day about 7 years ago. Do we ban Muslims? Protestants executed how many people for blasphemy? Catholics murdered how many people during the Crusades?  &gt;So the Dominionists control communities and kill those who disagree with them, and have had court cases establishing these facts?  Yes, indeed we do. Look up what happened in Salem under Christian theocratic rule in the 1600s. Look at the lynchings all over the South just 40 years ago. Look at the civilians dying in Iraq because of the Dominionists' desire to impose our will on them.  ***  Incidentally, you keep moving the goal posts. A common habit of Dominionists, I notice.  First your position was that a religion that does physical and emotional harm should be banned. Now, whatever physical and emotional harm I show you, you say that religion shouldn't be banned because the harm it does is not as bad as Scientology's.  So apparently we can only ban whatever you perceive as the worst religion in the world. So when Scientology is banned, what's next? Will you ban Buddhism then because Buddhism will be the worst to you? Hinduism?   *****  Also, I'm confused by your claims that people have a choice whether to follow the SBC, but no choice whether to become Scientologists? How exactly does that happen? Is Scientology genetic and SBC not? The decision is somehow made in the womb? Aren't the people who join Scientology just as responsible for their choices as the people who are reared SBC?  *And yes, my post has been heavily edited as I thought of more things that concern me about your position.

While I am also a Christian that mostly agrees with you, I think it's becoming necessary to teach abstinence along with contraseptives and what have you.  There's quite a pressure on people to have sex.   People will do what they want, but we should responcibly teach them the social implications of what happens as well.

I understand why you'd have that suspicion, but the U.S. Supreme Court actually has no jurisdiction to overturn the Vermont Supreme Court decision, because the decision rests on the state constitution.  It's sort of a beneficial quirk of federalism that the supreme courts of the individual states can stand up for individual liberties even, and especially, where the U.S. Supreme Court sits down.  The metaphor usually employed is that the U.S. Supreme Court sets a floor but not a ceiling on individual rights.  The trend (if you can call it that) toward state courts striking out to afford additional rights protections under their individual constitutions generally goes by the name judicial federalism.  It's a neat concept, and it's becoming more important as the U.S. Supreme Court increasingly rolls over on individual rights.

McCain is an old warrior. It's the second part that disqualifies him, not the first.  However, all things being equal -- which, of course, they never are -- I'll take a president in his/her fifties much, much before I'd want one in her/his seventies. I know a lot of men and women in their 70s and few, precious few, are capable of the energy a president needs. Sure, some have great wisdom and experience that makes their advice valuable and valued. I'd hope our 50ish president would have many such wise advisers, but I don't want to see them in charge.

&gt;Sex education is just that. Educating children about the mechanics and ways of human sexuality.  And if I don't want to educate my CHILDREN (from your statement) at the same age that you think I should educate my CHILDREN about this, then I just have to give in to your viewpoint? &gt;It is FACTUALLY based.  No kidding.  Where in my post did I suggest otherwise.  Don't kill yourself looking. I'm not arguing about whether it is factually based.  I'm arguing about whether the government gets to teach it to my kids, and when - or whether I get to teach it to my kids when I feel it is appropriate. Here's a valuable lesson for you - kids do not all mature at the same rate emotionally, mentally and physically.  But as usual, the school is going to apply a one-size-fits all program to each kid - and in reality - miss most of them. &gt;That you think it is anything but speaks volumes to your mindset.  That you put words in my mouth that I did not say or imply speaks volumes to your mindset.  Strawman. &gt;The answer is always more education. No, it isn't even the question, much less the answer.  The question is WHEN and HOW. I don't want some teacher that may have a different viewpoint about the world teaching my kid about sex at a time that may be sooner than I want to teach my kid about sex. I'll decide WHEN my child is ready for that conversation and I'll choose what perspective to put that education in based on my life experience.  I don't want Mr. Gym Coach telling my kid what sex is about. &gt; Your ability to shelter your children from education should not, in fact, be an impediment to their education. They aren't your property. You are merely their guardians. You don't have kids, do you?  Might I ask how old you are?  Kids are the most awesome responsibility you will ever encounter in this life.  Every decision you make after conception becomes huge and looming.   Whether you drink during pregnancy. Smoke during pregnancy. Vaccinate for Hep B (an unlikely illness for a newborn) at the hospital at 1 day old - or not.  Vaccinate on the prescribed schedule or not.  Breast feed or not.  Organic foods or not.  How much time you spend with your kid each day... It goes on and on.  And you will do every one of those things slightly different than your neighbor. Raising a kid isn't about property, it is about freedom.  This isn't about sex education, it is about freedom.  It is about whether the parent gets to decide how their child is raised or whether the government (who has shown JUST HOW GOOD they are at doing things time and time again /sarcasm) decides how a child is raised. I can assure you - I have the means and will to see that my child will not be raised by you, the government or a majority.   My son will be raised by me and my wife. I'll never understand how you would so easily give up your freedom to raise your child the way you see fit because you happen to agree with the majority on one thing and how people don't see the precedent they set when they support "making everyone do it their way." You should look at the big picture. You raise your kids your way, and let other people raise their kids their way.  What arrogance makes you so sure that you know best how other people should rais their kids?

The problem is that there are basically two parts to developing an operating system. The first is system integration, where the people running Distro A take people's patches, put them together, iron out any compatibility problems, and make a nice product with as few seams as possible showing. The second is actual development, here exemplified by some guy writing patches. The guy uses Distro A, cause the system integration guys did a nice job on it. So he goes and he puts his patch in Distro A's system for handling patches. But Distro B wants the guy's patch, since it applies to them just as much. Because all of the guy's work has been published into Distro A's system, Distro B has to go through that system, and thus Distros A and B waste time arguing over who should push patches to whom. If the guy is unsatisfied with this, he starts writing patches for A and B, then congratulations: now the guy is wasting time doing the system integration job that the distros could have been doing for him.  So yes, a unified but decentralized system would be nice.
He apparently makes some comments, so I wouldn't classify him as a total spammer. 
i use this exact soap every time i shower. buy it at trader joes.  have you ever read the ingredient on soaps and body cleansers? They are almost always petroleum based.

I'm not saying that the banks aren't partially to blame, but I'd blame them more so for linking the bad loans to exotic financial instruments and labeling them as secure investments.  I think that the asshats in the context of this story are most certainly the homeowners.

I live in Canada and it seems .NET is rampant at most businesses. So I decided to learn C# and ASP.NET. I'm good at making mini apps but I want experience in larger ones. Every large OSS app I have looked at just seem too complex for me right now. Does any one have any recommendations on any open source projects that are noob friendly? Specifically it will have good commenting, take the slightly longer route for code clarity, and without using too exotic language features.
you really, really don't.

Typically all metal items must be removed to allow for weapon screening.  Piercings can trip the alarm necessitating a search using the wands that screeners carry.  Of course when they pass the wand over the person's chest and the alarm goes off they're supposed to identify what metal object the individual failed to remove from their person.  Luckily most people are considerate enough to remove metal ornaments before going through security or the lines would be even longer.

In that case, misdemeanor assault should NOT be punished with prison time.  There are lesser punishments to deal with situations where Billy smacks Johnny at the pub.  Pay a fine, maybe do some community service, that type of thing.  This zero-tolerance nonsense needs to stop.  I assumed you were referring to felony assault, i.e. assault with a deadly weapon, since you used it in the same sentence where you accused me of being OK with armed robbery.
I think if you just teach sex education..people will (for the most part) figure out on their own that STDs suck, and that having a baby takes a lot of responsibility (and money). Hell, if everyone knew the average costs of raising even a single child, EVERYONE (at least reasonable people) would think twice about sex, or more specifically, sex with a person you aren't willing to raise kids with.
Too bad there's nothing to give you a sense of the enormous scale involved...
Thanks.  Burned any heathens lately?
&gt;I see a lot of "bloodthirsty vengeance" type comments on this article reflective of society at large. Believe you me, the people making those comments would not like living in a society where you live "by the gun." And I suppose you would say the same if your wife or gf were raped and you sat by helplessly as the legal system trudged along and you HOPED that they didn't screw it up on some technicality. I wish that I had been on the jury that heard this man's case, because he would not have served a day in jail for killing his girlfriend's rapist had I been on that jury.
My calling it a non-sequitor came from the following logic:  1) The [parent post](http://reddit.com/info/6e2ax/comments/c03lavk) did not mention anywhere that the victim "deserved it".  That was a subjective element added by you.  2) The jury acquitted him of murder, which I believe means in this case that they thought that he had *no intent* to murder him, but only *scare* him as the article said.  They believed him to be under a "extreme emotional distress" at the time, which clouded his ability to think clearly.  Thus, the lesser charge of manslaughter.  While we might discuss it conversationally as "murder", it appears that the local laws do not - it is "manslaughter".  (causing the death of another without intent to do so)  You said "*So murder is alright so long as the victim deserved it?*", which does not follow from anything in the parent post.  Thus, it is a non-sequitor.  Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, nor do I live in Manhatttan.

Currently there are about [15 000 cases a year](http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/b/brain_cancer/prevalence.htm) from brain cancer.  There are about [170 000 cases of Lung Cancer](http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/l/lung_cancer/stats.htm), most from smoking.  We have been around this sort of electromagnetic radiation quite some time, and still brain cancer is a small percentage of cancer deaths. Even if we assume mobile phones are part of the risk, which its almost certain they are not, saying they are anywhere near the risk of smoking is pretty unfounded speculation.

A not inconsiderable number of these parents withdraw their kids from school so that their children have no one to advocate for them.

Nothing handy, in fact I wouldn't swear that it's still true, since the ratio of rural to urban population has been dropping steadily. Most statistics probably categorize people by party affiliation rather than ideology, anyway, and the republican party is less and less equivalent with conservatism every day.  While I may have been exaggerating, I would maintain that a very large number of Americans hypocritically denounce "liberalism" while taking handouts and even demanding more.  I would also bet that those who benefit from the roughly [$200 billion](http://www.ctj.org/html/corp0402.htm) that we hand out in corporate welfare are heavily skewed toward the republican/conservative side.

I think I understand the problem.  This indicates that I chose the wrong example - most of that unreadability tries to find a common base type.  I see what you mean now. Here's a min function for all types that support smaller-than:   import std.stdio;    T min(T)(T a, T b) {    static assert(is(typeof((a&lt;b)?true:false) == bool),   T.stringof~" implements no comparison operator!");    if (a&lt;b) return a; else return b;  }    struct foo { }    void main() {    writefln(min(2, 3));    foo a, b;    writefln(min(a, b));  }  Output:   test37.d:4: static assert  "foo implements no comparison operator!"  This is what I meant originally.   --feep
You people are so uneducated about what it means to be liberal. Liberty is the backbone of America. To be liberal is to have preference to that liberty. I would be surprised if any Democrat was not liberal in any way.

I used to do the same thing in my high school econ class.  I literally wrote "My opinion is that you do not actually read these" in the middle of a paragraph, and the teacher put a check mark directly over it.

*America going soft, horrified by the realities of active self-preservation, minds boggled by the very idea of conquest.*  Aggressive wars of conquest - started by and sustained upon nothing more than blatant lies and criminal ego - are not now, and never have been, necessary for the self-defense of a nation.

&gt; ...he caused you to have a feeling in your heart that was so unprecedented that you knew it must come from some outside source. And at the the same time thoughts began entering your mind that you knew did not come from your own head.  How do you "know" a thought or feeling comes from outside your body/mind? You can assume as much based on having never felt/thought that way before, but that's not "knowing" anymore than I "know" that Ron Paul is going to win the presidential election because I've just never felt this way about a presidential candidate before. Our minds are highly creative and, unfortunately, not very reliable -- just look to all the people that fall for a different religion, cult, UFO experience, schizophrenia, etc. The mind is a powerful tool.  Now, if this happened every time I prayed and scientists could monitor the situation, determine my own thoughts or emotions are not responsible, and conclusively prove that some other agent *is* responsible... *that* would be evidence.

You laugh, but I once worked at a branch of a US government agency where they still had a printer/shredder.  It wasn't in use, and hadn't been for decades, but the department head loved it so much he couldn't bear to part with it.  It was a tractor-fed printer that gave you about 4 feet to be able to read the printouts before they dropped into a shredder.  It was part of a monitoring system for something.  It reported classified time-sensitive information that might occasionally need to be preserved, but for the most part was better off remaining ephemeral.
When the public order isn't working to begin with.  When a rapist is able to destroy, or at least significantly and negatively impact a woman's life through no fault of her own. I'm not ready to mount up a posse and kill every rapist, but I'd have been willing to let this particular killing slide by with a slap on the wrist if I was the Judge.  Maybe some probation.  That seems reasonable. After all, SOCIETY had nothing to fear from this guy.  Just rapists.  In particular, just people who raped HIS GIRL. He hardly seems a threat to society, and I wouldn't have felt any less safe on the streets if he had walked instead of serving 16 unbelievable years for the crime. If I had been on the jury then he wouldn't even have gotten a slap on the wrist...
Are you ironic?
&gt;We supply Israel with arms and under our protection it continues to build cities in the Palestinian territories while not allowing non-Jewish Palestinians a right to vote.

It's apartheid at its **most** efficient.   sarcasm/

The best argument for legalization is that it should never have been illegal in the first place.  Claiming that legalization will cause usage to go down isn't a provable claim, and has nothing to do with what the real argument should be, and that is the privacy issue. Arguing about which drug is less bad, or the effect on tax revenue will never cause anyone to change sides in the debate.  The fact is I should be able to do what I want in my own home as long as no harm comes to others. That's the only argument that matters in my mind. These other arguments are simply playing the abolitionist's game.

Keep in mind that Ada is intended to be used in environments with more stringent correctness-up-front requirements than most software has. In such environments, static typing can be helpful given a sufficiently powerful type system. What's kind of unfortunate, I think, is that Ada hasn't really kept up with the advances in type theory that have occurred since even its most recent standardization in 2005. On the other hand, I'd much rather trust my life to Ada code than 99.9% of code in other languages (including some that I like quite a bit, e.g. OCaml).

BSD was not originally free. Only with Net/2 in 1991 the first free version appeared (stripped of AT&amp;T code). This was in part because some of the developers were interested in the free software concept as spread by the GNU project (which is curious, given the animosity of the present BSD users towards the FSF)   The problem was that this release was stalled because of a suit filled by AT&amp;T, only settled in 1994, so 4.4BSD "Lite" in 1994 was the first free version not under any legal suspicion.  This came at a delicate time: Linux is from 1991, gained some steam in 1992 with X and in 1994 Linux 1.0 was released. This seems to indicate that the lawsuit came at a really bad time and without it Linux would not exist: reading the newsgroups of the time and the news reports give the impression that GNU was ready to use a BSD kernel, and Linus was driven to write Linux out of frustration with Minix's limitations and lack of alternative.
on the up side, the computers would run faster in the cold.

&gt; Muslims killed 3000 people one day about 7 years ago. Do we ban Muslims? Protestants executed how many people for blasphemy? Catholics murdered how many people during the Crusades? Yes a few Muslims did that, ask Turkey, a moderate Islamic state about that. &gt; Yes, indeed we do. Look up what happened in Salem under Christian theocratic rule in the 1600s. Look at the lynchings all over the South just 40 years ago. Look at the civilians dying in Iraq because of the Dominionists' desire to impose our will on them. That is some pretty far fetched reaching in time and space! &gt; Will you ban Buddhism then because Buddhism will be the worst to you? Hinduism? If Buddhists ask for physical retribution on anyone who disagrees with them I will be the first in line asking for removal of tax exempt status. There is no slippery slope here. &gt; Also, I'm confused by your claims that people have a choice whether to follow the SBC, but no choice whether to become Scientologists? How exactly does that happen? Is Scientology genetic and SBC not? The decision is somehow made in the womb? Aren't the people who join Scientology just as responsible for their choices as the people who are reared SBC? I was referring to the Africans who were forced into death somehow. But on that note, you do have a choice to join Scientology, but you are denying someone's choice to live when you kill that Suppressive Person in retribution per your religion's doctrine.   
Except that it was.

In the summer of 1965 I had completed my freshman year at college and with incredible luck got a summer job as a vacation relief broadcast technician at WOR-TV. My first night on the job I was assigned to work at Shea Stadium. I was the young new guy on the baseball crew, so they gave me the easiest job in the place... I ran the remote audio board for Mel Allen's play-by-play up in the press tier for the Atlanta Braves. I was running audio for Mel Allen!!!! This was only the first of many great moments for me at Shea. Later that summer I was operating camera 4 behind home plate. One night game three foul tips fell in on me while I was running the camera. The third ball I actually caught in my bare right hand. The director told me over the intercom to hold the ball in the air. Then Ralph Kiner announced to the world that I had barehanded the ball. I thought at the time it doesn't get any better than that. Later in my life I was at the world series and saw Mookie Wilson's lame single pass between Bill Buckner's legs. It definitely didn't get better than that.

&gt;No, it's not an outrage if you're a thinking human being.  Yes it is.  16 years is an outrage under the circumstances.  It is like the ridiculous zero-tolerance crap we have everywhere now. The law is supposed to be flexible enough to take into account extenuating circumstances. The guy could have killed the rapist in a bar-fight and gotten 4 years in prison. Instead he killed a rapist who raped HIS girlfriend and served 16 years for that. That is an outrage. &gt;You cannot advocate vigilante justice, regardless of the crime.  Yes, you can. It is easy for you to sit here - not in that man's shoes - and be all cool and rational.  But for him it wasn't theoretical and it wasn't about society and vigilantism or justice.  It was about HIS girlfriend being RAPED by a man and his desire to avenge that rape. &gt;It may sound great now, but the cost to innocent people is too great. I agree with you here.  I don't advocate vigilantism.  But 16 years was an outrage for this case.

What I don't buy about the argument that farmers did away with it, is that it was truly superior in all ways, they would have started growing hemp instead of cotton. The fact it was formerly common means this wasn't some new, scary crop that they didn't know how to deal with. They had already been growing it, as had their fathers and grand-fathers. Were it truly superior they would have been using it to begin with.

Yes, I have children. I will teach them everything I can, as soon as possible, about everything I know. And I will keep teaching them over and over. Guess what? I don't know everything. And neither do you. You already get to educate your children the way you see fit. That is the starting point. The JOB of the government is to make sure that ALL children get educated, regardless of the parental situation. Your position that the government has no business educating your children about sex because you think that it is your job is nearsighted. I should look at the big picture? What do you think would happen if we just said "okay, from now, the government is out of the education business"? Yes, I'll let others raise their kids their way. As long as they reach minimum standards for educating their children. Or is failing to educate your child your right as a parent? 
Occasionally, yeah.

&gt;Yes a few Muslims did that, ask Turkey, a moderate Islamic state about that.  So your claim is that every Scientologist has murdered someone? Why are you so concerned then whether they live or die, if they're all killers?  &gt;That is some pretty far fetched reaching in time and space!  It's ok for a religion to murder someone so long as they didn't do it--what last week? Last month? As long as they do it at least x # of miles from American soil?  Interesting set of ethics you got there.  &gt;But on that note, you do have a choice to join Scientology, but you are denying someone's choice to live when you kill that Suppressive Person in retribution per your religion's doctrine.  You're also denying someone's choice to live when you withhold from them medical information that could save his or her life, simply because you think they might not follow your religion if they knew.  What about the 89 women who have died of ectopic pregnancies in Nicaragua because the religious right there no longer accepts saving the life as the mother as a reason for abortion--even in the case of an etopic pregnancy, which cannot produce a living child and will kill most women if not aborted? How much choice do you think they had? You think sending them home to die of an easily treated medical condition is giving them a *choice*?   You're also denying someone's choice to live when you drop bombs on them for living in an Islamic country. Evangelicals are even now calling for us to bomb Iran unprovoked to start the Rapture. I don't get why it's ok to kill brown people in the name of religion but not white ones?

When your candidate can get more people to go sit down for an hour and publicly support them, they have a better chance of donations and volunteers for the next few months.

&gt; I don't know any type system that lets me encode anywhere near all of the information about I program that I have in my head.  You might find one of the type-theory-based theorem provers, or one of the dependently-typed programming languages, interesting. Personally, I use [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr), but see also [MetaPRL](http://www.metaprl.org), [Cayenne](http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~augustss/cayenne/), [Epigram](http://www.e-pig.org/), [Agda 2](http://appserv.cs.chalmers.se/users/ulfn/wiki/agda.php)...

I thought it would be a printer that printed directly on t-shirts... damn. 
No, duh -- we could just choose any other arbitrary set of letters to represent that number, like "Kwyjibo".  Oh, wait... there's infinite numbers, so we would need infinitely many constructs to represent those numbers...  Infinity make brain hurt!  Interesting question. I'd say that, if we use the traditional naming conventions (1=one, 2=two, ...) we wouldn't ever encounter elevnty. But if we decide to give all numbers cool names (like a [googol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol)), I would think it would be used at some point.   Mathematicians, would we prove this with the axiom of choice? It's been a while since my last advanced math class.  PS: sorry for crapping all over your joke :(
Yes.

&gt; &gt; We supply Israel with arms and under our protection it continues to build cities in the Palestinian territories while not allowing non-Jewish Palestinians a right to vote. It's apartheid at its more efficient. &gt; &gt; Since they're not citizens of the country of Israel, it wouldn't really make "sense" to let them vote, now would it?  Ah, but you miss the main point of the Israeli settlement enterprise.  The building of homes in the Palestinian territories (or Judea and Samaria) for Jewish Israelis.  They are outposts of Israeli sovereignty in a sea of non-Jewish Arabs who are excluded from the Israeli electorate.  It's no different than declaring every white in South Africa to be a citizen and every black to be a non-citizen and re-adjusting the borders of South Africa as needed to ensure that the white neighborhood are technically in South Africa while excluding the black neighborhoods.  That's what goes on every day in the West Bank (also known as Judea and Samaria.)

Seriously though, a lot of people (myself included) are often distracted by tangential minutiae.  Syntactic issues are only the most shallow place where this can happen, it's frustratingly easy to lose focus at many levels.  I've always had respect for people who seem to always be able to cut to the heart of a matter even when there are many other pieces that could be discussed.
I kept holding out hope they'd fix it. By the looks of it, nobody has or plans to address the problem, so a refund might not be a bad idea. It feels like losing though.

her analogy also suggests what so many people fail to understand about race problems in the states, that it is not as superficial as using the wrong terminologies at the wrong times (for example) but a phenomenon that is bred into us. with our incredible lack of collective self-awareness this makes it even harder to approach the constructive discourse that we need so badly. as stupid and abhorrent as it is to  use the term "cotton-..." to describe two extremely successful and well-respected (relatively?) politicians, it is besides the point of the race discussion to focus on name calling as the primary issue. This draws attention away from the most important problems of inequity, i.e. municipal infrastructure, public schools, hiring practices, incarceration, etc.

My point wasn't that the Nazis really embodied classical socialism, it was only meant as a response to the parent comment that expressed disbelief that a political movement could be considered both socialist and fascist. And although I consider myself to be far more socialist than not, it is silly to claim that socialism is always "done to improve the rights of individuals." There have been plenty of repressive socialist regimes. Any ideology can be abused by those in power, often because intellectually lazy people self-identify with said ideologies and use them as substitutes for the issues. Remember "compassionate conservatism"? It had a far better ring to it than "sell out our schools, rape our environment, tank our economy and bring chaos and death to the Middle East."

People ask "What Would Jesus Do?".  Those same people claim he has all the right answers to everything.  So, if you could ever know what Jesus would have done, then you have the knowledge of how to perfectly behave, and would not sin.  The dissonance occurs when their internal model of how they should act(Jesus) disagrees with their external model(actual actions)

I was a reporter covering the Marines back in the 1990s. One of the best things I ever saw was the Combat Skills Manual, E-1 to E-3. Had useful chapters such as, Cave in Enemy's Head with an Entrenchment Tool. (Paraphrasing, I think the actual title was, fight hand-to-hand using an improvised weapon).  It was more or less three steps, at the most. All of the combat skills ended with, "Kick the enemy, lying prone, in the head, ending the encounter." Again, a paraphrase, but "ending the encounter" I am certain of. Yeah, no shit it does.  By far the most ironic chapter was the one on withstanding a nuclear blast. Had a drawing of the mushroom cloud in the distance and everything. More or less, the Marine was supposed to lay face down, boots pointed at the blast. "Kiss ass goodbye" was not included in the list of instructions.  But you're so right about Marines fighting to win. They do not Hollywood this bullshit.

&gt;Murderers aren't dangerous criminals? This guy has shown that he is willing and able to kill when he feels slighted.  Hmm, so do you honestly consider someone raping your girlfriend to be a "slight."  Or are you using misleading and inaccurate statements to bolster your weak argument? &gt;Would you acquit if he had killed someone for cutting him off in traffic?  Ahh, I think that I see the problem.  You aren't able to discern the difference in cutting someone off in traffic and raping someone's girlfriend. Wow. &gt;How about stealing from him? He wasn't paying back murder with murder even, remember, he was paying back rape with murder. That's the best way.  Swift and disproportionate response is the best way to go when establishing boundaries with someone who is breaking the law.  It stops the lawbreaker and gives pause to those considering doing the same.

Reading some the FAQs, I keep wondering if there is not some ulterior motive. A number of Canadians have severe US-envy and would be happy to have US-style healthcare and capitalism. I think most of them feel Canada is keeping them from getting rich, or something.  A lot of the site seems to be written by Canadians, and seems slanted towards convincing Canadians that everything will be ok. But they don't mention what the US gets out of this union. Natural resources are the first things that come to mind. Hmmm, maybe it's Albertans running this, hoping to keep the Federal Government from imposing environment-saving regulations on their tar sands.  As an aside, any province can join the US at any time, according to the [US Articles of Confederation][1]. I'm not sure what standing that still has, though.  &gt;[Article XI][1]. Canada acceding to this confederation, and adjoining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.

I am saying that we cannot know that this guy has a high bar for what he considers to warrant death.  We don't even have to consider issues like this in a rational society where the laws are applied to everyone equally and vigilante justice is not allowed.  Would this guy murder his own grandmother for taking the last cookie?  I don't know.  All I know is that he believes himself to be above the law and doesn't believe that the laws of the society he lives in don't prevent him from killing when he feels personally that it is justified.  I can tell the difference between cutting someone off in traffic and raping someones girlfriend.  Can this guy?  I don't know.  All I know is that this guy is a murderer and should be put in prison for murder, regardless of who the victim is.  Period.  &gt;It stops the lawbreaker and gives pause to those considering doing the same.  It stops the lawbreaker but it most certainly does not give pause to anyone considering doing the same.  Read up on the death penalty as deterrent.  It does not work.  Not even a little bit.

I've noticed that every show is CSI and every episode some woman gets offed and increasingly the camera not only lovingly caresses every moment of her murder but then lingers longingly over her dead body.  It's rather distressing that this has become so commonplace that it's no longer noticed as uncommon or aberrant.  Just saying, the Victorians loved death, we love violence and especially against women so much so that it's what we let our kids watch.
It's true that Lisp on systems running UNIX or Windows isn't designed for systems programming. Lisp on Lisp Machines, however, was awesome for systems programming. :-)  As for performance, modern Lisp compilers do a really surprisingly good job at allowing you to choose what you care about with respect to performance. That is, Lisp tends to be optimized for writing correct code quickly and making the correct code quick possible; C tends to be optimized for writing incorrect code that crashes quickly and making the quick code correct possible. Which you prefer is, of course, a matter of taste.  Lisp hardly has enough syntax to be called either beautiful or ugly; it mostly just is. Let's put it this way: chances are if you looked at the abstract syntax tree of any other language, you'd think it was ugly, too. In Lisp, you're essentially always working with the abstract syntax tree (cf. macros). To many Lispers, that's a feature, not a bug.  As for an elitist community, absolutely (and I say that as a multi-decade member of that community). Lisp is pretty much the ultimate by-wizards-for-wizards language. That doesn't mean that no wizards use other languages (cf. Peter Norvig or Oleg Kiselyov), but it does mean that few non-wizards (or non-wizards-in-the-making?) choose to use Lisp on an ongoing basis. The fact that the Lisp community, by and large, likes it that way is pretty much the definition of elitist.

No offense if the author is reading, but I have much more sympathy for the people seeking jobs than I do for the HR gatekeepers who throw away their resumes for committing "outrageous" *faux pas* like attaching a picture of themselves. Ridicule like this honestly makes my skin crawl, not just because it's mean spirited but because it demonstrates just how commoditized people are in the corporate world and how arrogant some people become when they get to a place where they have any kind of power over others.  The best resume tip I can think of it is do anything you can to avoid having to make one. Find work through your network of friends and relatives and help them find work that way, too, by connecting people who wouldn't otherwise know each other. If that doesn't do it, learn some kind of trade that will allow you to either go into business for yourself or at least be evaluated objectively on the merits of your work and not your skill at portraying yourself in bullet lists.  I'd sooner work retail (again) than spend time and energy worrying about how impressive I can make myself look to HR Filter #5 at Megacorp #37.
&gt; So your claim is that every Scientologist has murdered someone? Why are you so concerned then whether they live or die, if they're all killers? No but it is their church's doctrine to do everything including kill to defend themselves from "suppressive persons". &gt; It's ok for a religion to murder someone so long as they didn't do it--what last week?  Doctrines evolve, previously the doctrine of many religions was to kill heathens. When CoS evolves and drops the fair game approach they too can enjoy tax exempt status.  &gt; Interesting set of ethics you got there. Indeed. Pretty straight forward but you are bringing up wonderful points. &gt; You're also denying someone's choice to live when you withhold from them medical information that could save his or her life, simply because you think they might not follow your religion if they knew. That happened recently in the USA and child protective services ripped the remaining kids away from the family, as they should have done. The family figured they could pray in order to heal their terminally ill child. That may happen outside the USA and that is wrong although outside of USA jurisdiction.   Dropping bombs on Islamic countries is stupid, as a liberal liberal myself I can't agree wit hthat. Although people subvert their religion to justify it, the religion doesn't support that. L Ron Hubbard, talks about it, but more importantly his believers follow it, it is part of the CoS right now, there isn't any debate within the CoS. Vs the Christians - some of them err on the side of peace, others err on the side of war.  Killing in Iraq is not directly related to a church's doctrines although many churches support it. 
It's quite true that it is an inherent limitation of the technology - and as resolution has increased, the smaller print nozzles are even more prone to clogging and require even more diligence in cleaning.  The switch to pigment-based inks probably hasn't helped either (as these are a colloid suspension of solids, rather than a solution of coloured dye), nor the prevalence of print heads that are fixed in the printer, rather than replaceable as part of the cartridge.  So, yes, it's an unfortunate fact of life - but not one that many people have examined in detail - which is why I thought folks might like the video.  ...However... I'm of the opinion that some brands of printer are a bit more zealous than they really need to be with the head cleaning - particularly those brands where you're practically locked in to buying original brand cartridges.  Can't prove that, but I suspect it.

It reminds me of all the morons here who think that being downvoted is suppression of free speech as well.

Money is not the meaning of "ammo" in this use. They mean stupid economic maneuvers supposed to revive the markets.
So do you blame the police when they have to enforce drug laws?  The root of the problem lies in outdated laws and regulations that govern the financial industry, which were worsened by an Administration that thinks that regulations of any sort aren't needed at all.  Now that it looks like the dust is settling (or at least we hope so), we need to take a stern look at why banks that form such an integral part of our economy were allowed to make bets that could've slid us into a depression.  30:1 leverage is fine and dandy for a little hedge fund.  30:1 leverage is not fine for a large bank that's got its hands in municipal bonds and such.

Now combining predicates and sharing them between functions isn't that straightforward anymore:   // a has to implement both + and - now  class newfeat a | +, - a where ...   myFun:: a -&gt; b | newfeat, +, - a  Also static assert doesn't seem to give the name/line number of the offending function. I think having more helpful error messages was one of the most desired properties of concepts.  Is there any easy way to do concept maps (referring to instances using compile time reflection comes to mind - but that's just butt ugly). I think this might prove that D probably also needs something similar to concepts / type classes (unless you happen to know some trick to make them work with existing features without too much trouble).

I heard that he killed someone else while in prison.
&gt;Yes, you can. It is easy for you to sit here - not in that man's shoes - and be all cool and rational.  Exactly.  THOSE are the people that should be determining the punishment for the rapist.  People who are cool and calm and rational.  People who are involved emotionally cannot be expected to mete out justice.  Look at what this guy did, he committed murder.  It will scar him for the rest of his life unless he is a sociopath.  Whether you think a killing is 'justified' or not, if you are not a sociopath, it will destroy you psychologically.  This guy should be punished severely for his crime because it is a crime that many people could easily be tempted to commit themselves - often on innocent people.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  What is the drawback everyone is expecting if we DONT let people go around murdering people when they think they know someone else has broken the law?

&gt;this should be made known to be unquestioningly unacceptable.  Not in my world. Where I come from, in cases like this the jury examines two critical questions: Did the dead man deserve killing, and is the defendant the one who should have done it?  If *both* answers are yes, the defendant walks, and that is justice. And that system works. The streets are not littered with vengeance-slain bodies.
I really don't understand your comment. Do you know what a syllogism is?  
On the contrary: if someone has spent a lot of time with, say, three or four (I'm being conservative) different languages and decides that Lisp is their favorite language, it tells you quite a bit. What tells you effectively nothing is when someone learns [Java|C#|Ruby|Python|...] because [It's how to get a job|It's the latest Microsoft technology|It's the latest fad in developing web apps|It's the language of choice among P2P hackers|...] and that's the only language they know/use.
Ammo is not money. Ammo is economic policies.
IIRC it was driven by the desire to have a unified language. There was a fear at the time, and this is coming from an Article in Air Force magazine from the mid 80's, that the new programing language of the week phenomena would  create integration issues at a time when the pentagon was seeking to have all weapons systems linked together.  If I remember correctly from the article, the example given was the C17. The article gave a list of almost 20 languages used by different vendors for different systems, and discussed the issues with getting everything talking.   I think this has largely been solved by standards for things we take for granted now like network protocols (the OSI model was developed by the DOD to address the same concern from a networking standpoint). But at the time they saw the need to make a language that would be used for everything so they would never have to worry about things being able to talk to each other. You have to remember that there were far fewer standards back then, so they had to create one if they wanted one.  Just fuzzy recollections from an article I read 20 years ago when this was first happening.
The way to fix that (imo) is to give kids the self-confidence to make their own decisions - not tell them what to do even more. That doesn't get to the root of the problem.   (Note: I'm not against talking about abstinence... obviously that should be included in a good sex-ed program. I just don't think teaching it addresses the problem you brought up. Make sense?)
Good point. I do agree.

I'm taking you to mean delegate count.  There's little left to pick up.  The current gap of 120ish would be a real triumph to close.  PA has 160 in late April, NC has 120 in early May,  and that's about all she wrote.  Since Democratic apportionment is proportional, Hillary would need a consistent and significant edge into June.

The Fed is the grand duke of the banking system. As has been said a thousand times, it is the one bank that can never run out of money. Expansion of the Fed's power has to be a little frightening. Capitalism has its roots in rewarding success, not funding failures. As other countries wise up, I'm sure a flight from the US dollar will ensue over the next few years and more and more foreign investors when lending to the US will demand that those loans be denominated in  non-US currencies.

Well yah, ideally but I have no power over what their wage is. The best I can do is agree to pay what they ask without trying to haggle them down and at least treat them in the same way I would a friend.

Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama both made statements on the resignation of Secretary Jackson.  The statement on HillaryClinton.Com read as follows:... 
&gt;When CoS evolves and drops the fair game approach they too can enjoy tax exempt status.  We're not talking about tax exemption. This got started because you called for an outright ban.  &gt;there isn't any debate within the CoS.  Your claim is that unlike the SBC, where opinion might be divided, all Scientologists support killing people who disagree with them? How is that not a choice then?  &gt;No but it is their church's doctrine to do everything including kill to defend themselves from "suppressive persons".  Again, they made the choice to join this church. I don't see how you can claim that someone who joins a church that calls for the death of suppressive persons has less of a choice than a woman who died because her access to medical care was taken away, whether she embraced the institution that took it or not. 
Depends on what they accomplished while they were there.
Fidel Castro became prime minister of Cuba in February 1959. In its first year, the new revolutionary government carried out measures such as the expropriation of private property with no or minimal compensation(sometimes based on property tax valuations that the owners themselves had kept artificially low), the nationalization of public utilities, and began a campaign to institute tighter controls on the private sector such as the closing down of the gambling industry. The government also evicted many Americans, including mobsters (who, in collaboration with Batista, ran the gambling casinos in Havana)) from the island. Some of these measures were undertaken by Fidel Castro's government in the name of the program that he had outlined in the Manifesto of the Sierra Maestra.  Since Cuba became a declared socialist republic in 1961, the United States Government has initiated various policy measures against Cuba's government, applying standards on Cuba which some believe it did not apply to countries with arguably equally poor human rights records. These measures have had a considerable political and economic effect on the island; these have variously been designed to encourage Cubans to remove the leadership and to undertake political change towards liberal democracy. The most significant of these measures was the United States embargo against Cuba and the subsequent Helms-Burton Act of 1996. The US government, its supporters and other observers contend that the Cuban government does not meet the minimal standards of a democracy, especially through its lack of multi-party contests for seats and the limitations on free speech that limit a candidate's ability to campaign. The Cuban government, its supporters and other observers within and outside Cuba argue that Cuba has a form of democracy, citing the extensive participation in the nomination process at the national and municipal level.

Er, except the ones that don't. Yeesh.  Lisp isn't pure, it's true. Then again, neither is Standard ML, OCaml, or Oz, yet they're all functional languages. Most Lisp code I've seen is quite judicious in its (ab)use of state. Then again, most Lisp code I've seen is the Lisp code I wrote. ;-)
Oh, you're reading his mind now.  He'd never kill unless it was something as bad as rape.  And you know that.  I apologize.  All I see is that this guy is a murderer who thinks that he has the right to judge who lives and who dies in place of the judicial system we've agreed upon as a society.  How does paying back rape with murder 'seem consistent'?  Rape is a horrible crime, but to equate it with murder denigrates life itself.

Dont support the establishment war hawk Obama. He is more pro war than Bush - he said he would bomb and invade Pakistan, he wants to leave the nuclear bomb option on the table with Iran, hes spoke in favor of the SPP to merge the USA, Mexico And Canada into a regional government, making ours obsolete. So much for that constitution and bill of rights.  He is pure establishment - his wife is a director of the chicago CFR, hes adopted the foreign policy of the anti russian, anti american Zbigniew Brzezinski, whos said that Americans have had it good for too long.

&gt;Ah, but you miss the main point of the Israeli settlement enterprise. The building of homes in the Palestinian territories (or Judea and Samaria) for Jewish Israelis. They are outposts of Israeli sovereignty in a sea of non-Jewish Arabs who are excluded from the Israeli electorate.  And? Maybe if the Palestinians got their act together, this could have been resolved long ago.   &gt;That's what goes on every day in the West Bank (also known as Judea and Samaria.)  Judea and Sumaria... I wonder where they came up with those names. 
This is a pretty standard ploy by government.  If the government fails, it demands more responsibility and power.  If a business fails, in true capitalism, that's it, it dies, clearing the way for more effective leadership.  And in general the media goes idly by, calling schemes like this "modern" and about "stability," when in fact it's a simple power grab, and all this could have been avoided with the powers the Fed previously had, had they simply raised the interest rates.  Some will argue which was more important, the rates vs. the oversight, but clearly they have a responsibility to set the rates, and they performed poorly in doing so.  From [good ole 2003](http://money.cnn.com/2003/06/24/news/economy/fed_walkup/):  &gt; the Fed has cut the fed funds rate 12 times since the start of 2001, to a 41-year low of 1.25 percent.  &gt; Other, longer-term rates have also tumbled to historic lows. Most important, **mortgage rates are lower than ever, encouraging a boom in housing that's helped homeowners feel wealthier and allowed people to refinance mortgages at lower and lower rates, putting more cash in their pockets**.  [A similar story](http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8954621_ITM) from the same time:  &gt; The Federal Reserve Board did its part to help Johnson and other homebuyers, [by] cutting interest rate[s]. The move indirectly will help keep mortgage rates near historic lows, and perhaps push them lower. It also should alleviate concerns that the housing market could slip from its comfortable perch.

&gt; I'm an atheist Brit, but there are many religious people in the UK - I think the last figure was only 21% were atheists.  I think the various polls show a significant difference depending on whether it is a question of belief or a question of identity.  A lot of people in the UK would answer a question "Are you a..." with "Christian", simply because that was how they were raised and they never really thought about it. But ask the same people "Do you believe..." and you'll find a lot of them don't believe in a god.  At the end of 2006, [an FT poll](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/12-20-2006/0004495063&amp;EDATE=) gave these results for the UK:  * 35% believe in any form of god/supreme being. * 35% agnostic/weak atheist. * 17% strong atheist.
haha, in an English class I had in high school I started to realize that my teacher wasn't grading my work very carefully (likely because my older sister was a star student), and I remember on the final I put down "Gomer Pyle" for the answer on everything I didn't know.  I still got a 100 on it.
As a software license compliance auditor, half a million is nothing.  And anyway, the fact is, almost no one is fully in compliance with their licenses.  It's usually completely unintentional and stems from bad IT purchasing practices.  A lawsuit is pretty rare though, most times, the target firm just settles up.  Son'y behavior in letting this get to legal proceedings is very odd.
&gt;Yes, I have children. I will teach them everything I can, as soon as possible, about everything I know.   Come on now.  One way or another this has to be a problematic statement. What do you mean by "as soon as possible?" Do you mean, "as soon as you think they are ready?"  If so, then what if the school decides they are ready before you do? If you really mean "as soon as possible" as in "as soon as you think they might possibly understand it" then more power to you - but I don't want you choosing when MY kids learn about sex ed. &gt;Guess what? I don't know everything. And neither do you.  That's my point.  I KNOW that I don't know everything, thus I don't believe that I should tell other people when and how to educate their children about sex. And I don't want other people telling ME when and how to educate MY kids about sex. &gt;You already get to educate your children the way you see fit. That is the starting point. The JOB of the government is to make sure that ALL children get educated, regardless of the parental situation. We differ greatly here.  I see the job of government is to OFFER education to all children.  It is the job of the PARENT to choose when and how that child is educated. And with the exception of a rather controversial ruling in California right now, I believe most states allow you to homeschool your children - which re-inforces MY viewpoint of the government's job when it comes to education. They provide it, but you are free to take their version or provide your own.  You also - of course - have the right to send your child to a private school of your choosing.  Which again supports my view of the government's role in education - to provide it, not forcibly deliver it. &gt;Your position that the government has no business educating your children about sex because you think that it is your job is nearsighted.  I disagree for all the reasons I stated above.  YOU can let the government educate your kids about sex, but I choose to do that myself.  The difference is that you seem to be ok with forcing your viewpoint on me, while I am content to raise my kids the way I see fit and let you raise your kids the way you see fit. &gt;What do you think would happen if we just said "okay, from now, the government is out of the education business"? Yes, I'll let others raise their kids their way. As long as they reach minimum standards for educating their children. Or is failing to educate your child your right as a parent? I never said that or even implied that. I've said all along that it is your right as a parent to decide WHEN and HOW your child is educated about sex.

Cornucopia of clauses
Quote: "Economist Ofer Azar recently came up with a novel way to study the insidious nature of the action bias. He examined whether soccer goalies were more likely to stop penalty kicks when they dived to the left, dived to the right or stayed in the center of the goal. In a study of 286 penalty kicks faced by elite Israeli goalkeepers, Azar found that goalies had the best chance of stopping a kick when they remained in the center -- partly because when they dived to one side, they left themselves with no chance of stopping a kick aimed at the other side or a kick aimed dead center. And even when they correctly guessed the direction of the kick, they still had only a 1-in-4 chance of stopping a goal. "
I think this is a valid point, and in this case it choose the one that is more likely to win.  I still think it is messy, goes for too long, and is doesn't reflect a true democracy.  'Course I think we should get rid of the Electoral College as well.

The TED talk also isn't insightful from the perspective of a brain scientist.  The beginning of the talk started out strong with descriptions of the brain and what was happening, but after that, her talk was nothing more than a recount of her experience that I feel a lot of stroke patients could have given.  The special insights a brain scientist could have given ceased, and she simply talked about calling for help on the phone and the loss of control over her body.

No, there is no burden on either side to prove or disprove God or religion.  We are merely debating whether intelligent people can believe in God.

And certainly you can *use* GPL software for commercial purposes.

I think this is fair enough, but I do feel compelled to point out that there are at least three or four extremely high-quality free Common Lisp implementations, there are port[able|ed] libraries for important features like sockets and threads (on implementations that support threads at all), and there are two pretty-darned-good portable FFIs so you can always call out to C in a pinch.  I think even without some of the tools from other environments, the sheer freedom of genuinely interactive development--without sacrificing native compiled code when you're done--is a huge win that I think is undersold in the dynamic languages community relative to the popular languages like Ruby and Python. And if Common Lisp is too big and ugly, there are several very nice Scheme implementations that compile to native code, too.

As interesting as Epigram is, encoding the majority of the information I know about a program is simply far too time consuming for any real application. That's not to say that encoding critical properties of a particularly difficult bit of code isn't incredibly useful; it certainly is. I was simply taking issue with bcash's overgeneralization.

It's also portrayed as an additional form of punishment, e.g. cops in movies and TV series threaten suspects and witnesses with being raped in prison. And I think this is probably not only Hollywood's invention.  Trivializing prison rape happens also in other countries. Germany for instance, a country with a much lower incarceration rate,  is home to [this](http://www.peoplelikeyou.de/) jolly good record company.  [Here are 2006 incarceration rates per 100,000 people](http://www.nccd-crc.org/nccd/pubs/2006nov_factsheet_incarceration.pdf) (PDF) for different countries, compiled by the National Council for Crime and Delinquency. 
That's funny.  I only see it now that you point that out.  Something about the phrasing, with the leading ellipsis, makes it initially seem contrary and doesn't set off the joke detector.
&gt; If it's not statistically significant, the study does not support...  It's not a matter of "supporting" that conclusion.  That conclusion is a fact, not a statistical inference.  The quotation is reporting *actual findings* in a specific sample group.  (Note "were" not "are" less likely) The second part indicates that this result cannot be generalized to a larger population.

But I STRONGLY disagree with the sentiment here that the government should get to run roughshod over parents rights to educate their children about sex the way they see fit. I am arguing more for the Libertarian belief system that I hold - not for the belief system that I have about sex ed.
&gt;The opposition to the HPV vaccination is the fear that vaccinations are not safe.   That may be some people's objection.  But the evangelicals have certainly raised objections on moral grounds, and I can't imagine any fair-minded, well-informed person not acknowledging that fact.
What's a record store?
&gt;&gt; real-world lisp syntax (as opposed to reddit erotic fantasy) is insanely convoluted.  &gt; Intellectually dishonest much?  You asked that of qwe1234? You're new here, aren't you?
for gods sake when will they get an rss feed?
The article was three pages so I didn't finish reading it.  Was one of the insights that some things are unnecessarily long?
FROM ARTICLE ... According to the Spamhaus Project, about 200 spammers worldwide are responsible for about 80% of all spam ...  What's stopping us from shooting them in their  faces?  'Cause I have a lot of friends who work for the US gov't who like to shoot a-holes in their faces.   (Come on, revised FISA statutes have to be good for something!)
One of my favorite tests I don't have anymore, but there was something about the angle at which a spotlight would hit a stage in one of my geometry classes, so I drew out a stage, audience, spotlight, performer (stick figure of course), everything on the back to illustrate it.  I don't think I got any bonus points but I had fun doing it.
Fact: You obviously meant "Assistant Regional Manager".
Yay! It's the "let's write a windowing system in plain vanilla C" windowing system.  Shudder.
After they were called, it took them two hours to show up?  WTF why? 
Nice one.
Right, that economic policy that says: "if the banking industry gets in trouble, give them more money from the tax payers."That one, yep, youre right,   Its just an economic policy.
The awesome thing about this trailer is that it appears to have been shot outside the Zanzibar strip club on Yonge Street in Toronto.
thank god for fios. finally got to break away from the chains of comcast and get a better picture quality to boot. though verizon is only marginally less loathsome than comcast.
i liked the title.
Wait...you mean you pay your taxes willingly?
got me. I read it. I'm a SUCK-A
8% huh?
deer &gt; matelot
Zer gut.
it's more believable, too.
does she code?
Nice misspelling "to it's faith" about 2/3 the way through.  Its, not it's.
Ah, so it WAS Shackleton! That's a good starting point, thanks!
Oh yea, Canada has jillionz of them.  
Maybe I should just go conservative after all.
Very well reasoned.  Which of course, will be lost on the fundies, but good try anyway.
Voted up because I DO hate the fake stories, but... A low-end HP with an AMD chip and barely usable RAM for $299?  I guess I don't get it ...
I pointed this out on a pro-Clinton blog and got banned. 
I suck at memorizing useless facts.
Cuba=Still friends with Russians.
Nazism espoused the idea that it was the duty of Germans to serve their fellow Germans. Hitler wanted private property to be regulated to make sure "benefit to the community precedes benefit to the individual". He also adopted many socialist ideas such as limiting profits, abolishing rents and generously increasing social benefits (but only for Germans of course).
do not click the -&gt; either... 
&gt; We're not talking about tax exemption. This got started because you called for an outright ban. I talked about not granting religious status which means no tax exemption, that doesn't mean the CoS is banned. Churches make a killing off of that, a pastor can make $20k/year and do just as well as someone making $50k/year. &gt; Your claim is that unlike the SBC, where opinion might be divided, all Scientologists support killing people who disagree with them? How is that not a choice then? I am referring to the choice of those being killed. The people SBC affects are given a choice to be killed, information on the internet outlines what they do, people can drop the kool aide and leave. There is brainwashing and manipulation but the victim still has a choice and an out. CoS doesn't allow that choice for the people it has killed and continues to kill.  &gt; Again, they made the choice to join this church. I don't see how you can claim that someone who joins a church that calls for the death of suppressive persons has less of a choice than a woman who died because her access to medical care was taken away, whether she embraced the institution that took it or not. They join the church and part of that is following its doctrine of fair game which L Ron Hubbard described. In the case that a family prays for their child rather than giving medical attention to that child, and the child dies, the government steps in and takes the child away. I don't see baptists doing that within the jurisdiction of the USA, namely because they get arrested, they know better. They might pull these stunts outsid eof the jurisdiction of the USA of course.
Why is this nation so full of crazies?
Ohhh... *that's* why the $3 bottle of 2007 merlot (bought from the dollar store up the street) tasted awful at first, and got better a few days later after sitting open in the fridge. I thought it was my imagination. Maybe I'll go back and buy a few more, now that I know it's not just utter crap.  (and no, I'm not a wine snob. I like the alcohol :)  )
Your mother is as dumb as a box of rocks and you can't cure stupidity. Just count yourself lucky that that you survived your childhood, and that you're no longer in her care. 
The Andouché sounds sounds like a fencing technique.
They have plenty of ammo.
Yes, I know, I forgot my sarcasm tag.
Damn, I feel like a stalker now. Second post of yours I've upmodded in about 30 seconds.
How many cows does the USA kill each year?
USPE? Just post it in Politics.
There is no right to privacy granted where no privacy could reasonably be expected. And driving around in THAT car, in public, after you stole it, you could not reasonably expect privacy. 
Why don't you take a seat, take a seat right over here.
You've failed to notice that the subber's title does put LiveLeak as the active agent of suppressing the freedom of speech and not the Muslims.  It should've read "Muslims force liveleak to remove video by threat of violence."
you forgot Unobtainium
I'm a true blue dyed in the wool yankee. I can trace my last name to a boat coming from england in 1638, and now I live in the south.  I gotta say, the jobs are better and the women are hotter.  Send 'em to South dakota. 
saving a ton of money getting that satellite into space, yeah

only two letters away from a real element though.
You used a whole bottle of Jergens on that one comment, didn't you?
Love the caps, very stylish.
And let the witch hunt begin.
Needs more timecube.
What's wrong with submitting a picture, as long as it's simple and professional? If you're coming in for an interview, seems more likely you'd be recognized if the resume had a picture...  But eh, I've never really made a resume yet.
I fucking love suttsteve, great guy.
&lt;obligatory "You care enough to comment" post&gt;
I was about to say an anti-immigration stance isnt inherently racist, but without the word "illegal" in there it's certainly xenophobic. Not like this guy is smart enough to make that connection.
Freelancer was a pretty decent successor to Privateer.
And I got to watch it broadcast live on Channel 5 (UK)! 
Well, it could be the only experience some people have.
Except with safesearch on, it doesn't show up.
Thanks for posting this in the politics subreddit, oh wait.
I get a sense she is a little frustrated.  
I've had it. If you ever do, get ready for your alter to bring up how the Kennedys were liquor barons. At least, that's what happened to me. I think I lost, as I just couldn't see what the connection was.
They have everything to do with each other. If Chinese businessmen think selling poison as food is a good practice, I'm sure the mind-set is reflected in the quality of the buildings as well.
You think that the rational response to a unfavorable superpower neighbor with nukes is to try to import some of your own? That seems like you are asking for a fight to me.
&gt;shows that essentailly, "language" is a socially-embedded, rule-guided activity.   This is a contentless statement. _Everyone_ agrees that people communicate using a shared, socially-embedded system. Saying that we should use the word "language" to refer to this system and not to anything else simply adds nothing to the discussion. Nothing can "show" that this statement is true, because it's just a proposal regarding the use of terminology.  Chomsky makes an analogy which I think is quite helpful. He says that the question of whether "language" is fundamentally so-and-so or such-and-such is like the question of whether or not planes fly or submarines swim. There simply isn't any fact of the matter, it's just a question about how we use terminology.  &gt;It's like someone trying to work out which part of the brain is responsible for the rules of chess having the form they have. It's an interesting question but you're going to get puzzled looks if someone asks you to tell them about the game of chess and how it is played and you respond by going on about psycho-chemical processes in the brain, and such.  Yes, but so what? Both are legitimate topics of study (i.e. the psychology of chess playing and the game of chess considered as an abstract object). Even the most ardent Chomskian would agree that the study of animal communication is interesting and worth doing.
Beautiful.
... and it doesn't seem like it's really for anything related to running The Pirate Bay itself, but just your typical file sharing?  &gt; "related to the sharing of 24 music albums, nine films and four videogames using the service."  So I must say this came a bit out of the blue.
Prof. Feldman (the link) also wrote the Ada textbook. I know cuz I'm a cs.seas.gwu.edu alum.   Ada is really good for teaching software engineering and mission critical applications for the exact same reasons it's horrible for every other purpose. Ada does not do ambiguity. Everything is spelled out in excruciating detail. Some statically typed languages nag you, Ada puts on her leather and whips your ass. 
man, I got 35 in the first 4 minutes then quit.  Haven't had a chemistry class in about 9 years though.
That's nothing. One time in Kentucky she grinned down a bear...
Are they going to release the software?
Interesting bit, if true...  --------  In 1979, Israel rewarded Falwell with a private jet. Two years later, he received Israel’s Jabotinsky Award for his support. According to one press account, “Jewish-evangelical relations had become so close by the early ’80s that, immediately after Israel bombed Iraq’s nuclear reactor in 1981, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin telephoned Moral Majority leader Rev. Jerry Falwell before calling President Ronald Reagan to ask Falwell to ‘explain to the Christian public the reasons for the bombing’.” http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/17/1259/
What is it now, 16-14?  I didn't mean the team we beat's fans won't be upset.  I was referring to the casual fan of any other team a number of whom were sick of *both* Lakers and Celts as Champs.  Like we got sick of Michael and Scotty and the "supporting cast".
I guess you're hoping people won't click on that almost 20 year old link--from a time before much was known about HIV--and see all the bad information in it.  Hint: the title is "The Myth of Heterosexual AIDS." Statistics since the time that piece was written have pretty well shattered the author's premise that only gay people need to be worried about HIV.
