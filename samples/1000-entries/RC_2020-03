How certain are you all her post wasn’t satire?  It looked to fit with the sentence structure, but if she was older maybe I believe it was real.
So, first off, you sound quality is really freaking good. Editing was really nice and clean, although I found myself confused on what the into was. Maby make that a bit more obvious? Also, pro tip, people normally don't like having "LiKe AnD sUbScRiBe" pushed in their face right at the beginning of a video. Do that at the end, makes people much more likely to actually do it. Also, you seem like you are not one of those annoying "gamer girls" and actually enjoy playing. All around? Color me impressed! :)

To be clear, he's banned for refusing unlicensed examiner to take drug tests from him.   He is not banned for drug use.  There is still no legitimate evidence at all of him taking drugs.   He's been banned because he refuse to have unqualified personels performing the examination.  Which is out rightly unjust.

I’m an alchi (10-12 drinks a day) and kratom makes it so I have 3-4 drinks instead. Which is great! If I try to drink my normal amount, I get waves of nausea. Just don’t over do it and you’ll probs be aight!
Take away the cringe “SNOWFLAKES” part, and I agree. Slurs and insults and swears only have the power we assign then. We absolutely can and should remove power from them, and it’s entirely possible. The LGBT community gave Queer a positive spin and readopted it as an empowering term.
I've read a lot of fantasy and science fiction and I am surprised that nobody brings up just how straight brutal The Lies of Locke Lamora is at times. You say it's "just fun" but that's not exactly the thought I had when certain things happen to the characters. Hoo boy.

Get a security door that has steel bars. Then install it behind your current wood door. Like a screen door opening the other way. This way it still has a nice looking wood door that most people see but you get the security cage door. Air flow shouldn't be a problem.

Surprisingly uninjured for the accident. I had a swollen leg and a tiny bit of internal bleeding that healed quickly but I walked away.
Clare also has a letter saved that she has never read,  addressed to to her future husband from her father who passed away years ago. This was in her storyline on Juan Pablo's season.
I wish I was there to make you feel good
I have a slightly similar story, although with a better ending. When I was a teenager, a group of guys came up to me, pretty obviously looking to start shit. One told another I was the kid who suckerpunched him (I was not, I'd never seen the guy,) then threw a wild punch that kinda caught my jaw. This was outside of the coffee shop my band was playing that night, &amp; quite a few people saw him hit me, so the "attack" ended pretty much right then, with a bunch of punk rock kids running after the four or five assholes. Some people are just dicks for no reason, &amp; if you ever experience it like that again, I hope you have your own group of degenerates to chase them off.

Idk man, he mentioned the first US death and talked about pushing up travel restrictions and warnings. Plus the reason they did it in mid day Saturday instead of Sunday evening is because they think it’s bad news so they want to give market time to get over it rather then announce Sunday evening like they would with good news

Hello, u/its-ur-boi54 and thank you for submitting to r/antimeme! An antimeme can have several definitions, so here's a couple:  1. An image that looks like a meme but has no joke or punchline  2. A meme template that is taken literally, therefore removing its intended comedic purpose  [Here is a guide on what is and is not an antimeme](https://www.reddit.com/r/antimeme/comments/eatqu4/a_guide_of_what_to_post/). An antimeme is NOT r/boneachingjuice or r/speedoflobsters. Those types of memes belong on their own subs.  Users, if this post, *be nice to the good boy or girl*, is an antimeme, upvote this comment.

Not every chip produced is going to be detect free - the designs themselves may even incorporate a degree of redundancy, especially on the graphics side.  Even then however, you will still end up with dies that have multiple defects or fail to hit the intended clock speeds.  So having a target market for those second rank chips is in no way an unreasonable thing to do - it's basically standard operating procedure for CPUs and GPUs.  Any impact that this will have from a developer's perspective should be reasonably easy to mitigate with an adequate SDK.  Ultimately the main consequences of this sort of decision are to improve stock and reduce costs - so not really a bad thing as some seem to think.
&gt;I personally believe in sex dysphoria (and both traumatic and idiopathic origins for it, including the possibility of both and one influencing the other), and I think that even in an effectively genderless society, it would still exist.  I agree on both points. It seems like a lot of people say that you have to "pick a side" on why sex dysphoria exists but I don't see why.

Late 20s (ugh fuck me), I've been back and forth between a week or two sober to back at it for 2-whenever the fuck I break down. Anywhere from a 375 to fifth of vodka depending on when I get home. I usually get shakes by 12-2, sometimes minor hallucinations/vertigo. I mostly only keep drinking at this stage because I don't want to go through the withdrawal.  *Oh and I'd say I probably started hard when I was like 21, stopped when I broke up with that chick, then off the wagon when I met my next gf (also when I started smoking), and then we broke up and the wagons completely gone.

&gt;There was both an audio and visual cue  First, this isn't the topic of the complain, the bombarment didn't do any noise  I would understand it if I would have been the only one to not notice the bombardment, but neither of my teammates could hear it, three people at different locations, its easier to judge while you are not the onein te moment, i also noticed what you are saying but i noticed after watching the replay.  Now im asking you, whats easier: 1-see that milisecond red aura of the expansion area while reloading, looking your teammates health and analyzing if i have time to healed before the pathfinder clap wraith's ass, 2- hearing the "airstrike" phrase by the wraith that blends with the eva-8's shot while trying desesperatly to help your teammate or 3- A loud motherfucker DDUUUUUUNNNNNNN that can be easily heared by everyone miles of the site of bombardment.
a. The roster did deteriorate from last season. There are improvements with Vettori but that's nothing compared to losing a reliable back-up. He's going to choke in a big game. You know it.  b. Modena from last season =/= this season. Check the stats of Zaytsev. I watched the games. There's no need to play it like your observation is the only truth. Both can be true.  c. It was a catastrophe in my eyes but it is subjective. Achieving the triplete and winning only a single cup after bringing the best player in the world is not a particularly great result.  d. Lisinac is a monster this season but his serve have been inconsistent for some time. Worst it got to was during the Champions League game with Budejovice.  This isn't a big problem if Vettori or Russell are serving alright but they have just one bench server and Codarin does not have a powerful one to break Lube's reception.  Nelli used to do that for Trentino but he's gone. Djuric couldn't play without using two subs and I doubt he can do better than the three or even impove if he only plays a maximum of 10 mins?!? of game time this season... so far.

Breachlight/Beloved? Been trying to get a god roll on Beloved for ages, same with Twilight. I ran with Sole Survivor for a while and thought I loved it but I all of a sudden just couldn't vibe anymore, I think it's the chevron.

Thank you for the input, and also tht website link.   I built a custom spreadsheet that does something similar but the website looked much easier.  Also I read it accepts "snow flakes" which my spreadsheet also does. I get bonuses and regular raises and want to be sure those extra dollars get factored in. Not to mention I plan on doing some freelance work on the side to help boost progress, and while I don't want to factor that into my hard budget I like projecting in my snowball.   I think the comparisons will help put my mind at ease.  While this is somewhat of a math dilemma you hit the nail on the head with it being a mental block.  I don't want to lose steam or motivation by going too slow.

Well, from my point of view it's you who don't get my point about Thrawn and the inquisitors. And I commented on that fact, I said they didn't have enough training. Also the inquisitors may be quite different from each other. One can kill a jedi master, another can't keep up with a former padawan (not Rebels, but Fallen Order. There were even two of them, and Cal was still remembering the Force. That pretty much says everything about the inquisitors. Even Maul, who was also just a former assassin didn't break a sweat defeating and killing them). And keep in mind that Kanan defeated the Grand Inquisitor, so he wasn't really as bad at duelling as you consider him to be.
That’s retarded
Yep
Does that work the opposite way, too?  As in 4x the downvotes?

Did they explain why they believed this was a criticism of the movie? I'd honestly watch the review myself but it is legitimately too long. I'm genuinely curious why they cite it as a weakness of the movie, especially when there's a lot of other commonly understood flaws of the movie worth actually discussing.

Like I said before, I watched the leaked episode last Thursday. I have now written down a more detailed summary. Contains everything that I remembered from my first viewing experience:  HEAVY SPOILER WARNING!  Here is what happened to Hugh:  &gt;!... first he was captured by the Romulans. (Elnor first managed to escape and hide.) Narissa interrogated him and wanted to know how Soji and Picard could escape. Hugh refused to answer her questions. Then she lined up his patients (the Borg XBs) and get them shot dead by a firing squad in front of his eyes. \[Once again, unfortunately, a lot of gleeful and unnecessary violence.\] He collapsed crying on the floor. Narissa told him that she unfortunately could not kill him, too, because he still has the status of a diplomat. !&lt;  &gt;!Later in the episode, after a lot of the A-plot at Riker's new home planet was shown to the audience, they briefly returned to the cube. Hugh, who was allowed to run around the hallways again, met Elnor and they discussed their further plans. Unfortunately he was under surveillance by Narissa ... so suddenly a Romulan security squad arrives out of nowhere to confront them. Narissa declares that Hugh just violated his treaty obligations as a diplomat by planning a conspiracy against his Romulan hosts. Therefore he has no longer diplomatic protection. She and her hit squad then immediatley try to kill both men. !&lt;  &gt;!First, Hugh manages to escape, while Elnor takes out the guards. Then we get a Matrix-Style Kung-Fu battle featuring Narissa and Elnor. Both insult each other in Romulan language and the new lore that was introduced in Episode 4 (that the Zhat Vash and the Warrior Nuns hate each other in Romulan society) is used as a background for an intense hand combat sequence. When Hugh tries to intervene, sticking his neck around the corner, Narissa suddenly throws a hidden blade at him ...  the blade meets its target and cuts halfway in his throat. Elnor tries to comfort Hugh while Narissa beams away because she was in danger of losing her fight. !&lt;  &gt;!Hugh got a few lines left that he whispers to Elnor, then he loses consciusness. I assume that this was meant to be a death scene. The only hope for him would be that he was just poisoned - but which doctor would save him now in hostile Romulan territory? So I guess he is dead.!&lt;  Other important events in Episode 7:  &gt;!\- The episode begins with a flashback to the scene where Commodore Oh meets Dr. Jurati in Episode 3. This time the audience is allowed to follow their interactions longer than last time. Oh tells Jurati that she wants to recruit her for a special mission that will demand a lot (of sacrifices?), then she forcefully mind-melts with her for ten seconds. We see ultra quick cuts of events that might happen in the future (if the Androids run the Alpha Quadrant in the future?) that show violence and destruction of federation buildings and ships. This seems to imply that Commodore Oh is either from an alternative future or was also mind-melted before with someone from this future. Otherwise she wouldn't be able to show Jurati these pictures. After ten seconds Jurati collapses and starts crying.!&lt;  &gt;!EDIT: To be clear, that these violent pictures in Juratis mind are from an alternative future is only a speculation from me by now. Could be pictures from a past tragedy as well.!&lt;  &gt;!\- In the C-Plot of the episode Narek is able to secretly follow Rios and his ship because Jurati was forced to swallow a tracking device by Commodore Oh. Rios detects that he is followed by a Romulan and is becoming suspicious how that is possible. He then tells Jurati that he is suspicous of Raffi. Jurati gets a guilty conscience and tries to puke the device out of her stomach. She collapses on the floor of sickbay and is found by the EHM.!&lt;  &gt;!\- Seven is not in the episode, but in the last scene someone (I think it was Elnor, if i remember correctly) plans to contact her with the hidden communication device she left on the ship.!&lt;  \- That said the A-plot was really really good. I highly recommend the episode for old TNG fans. Riker and Troi interacting with Picard for one episode was simply amazing. Not cheesy or clunky or weird, but really really good. The A-plot is in a way like "Family (TNG 4x02)" and covers 80 percent of the episode. Some spoilers about the plot on Planet Riker:  &gt;!\- Riker and Troi had two children, a boy and a girl. Like her mother Lwaxana, Deanna had to deal with a tragedy, one child died early. Her son had a rare disease and could not get treatment with advanced technology because the federation banned all synth-technology in 2386. So the Rikers have a little bit of a grudge against the federation as well, but are still living a relative satisfying retirement. They are still full of joy, not of hate (like Seven).!&lt;  &gt;!\- Maybe because her teenage daughter, Khestra, gives them joy every day. She immediatly befriends a traumatized Soji and tells her stories about Data and the good old TNG days.!&lt;  &gt;!\- The A-plot has many nice scenes with Riker and Picard together. Riker is not portrayed as broken or bitter, but rather cheerfull, concerned for Jean Luc and witty. He is Number One again and offers his old captain help for his mission. But Picard declines, alrady afraid that Romulan killers might show up soon on this planet as well. Riker mentions that he is still on reserve duty for Starfleet.!&lt;  &gt;!\- Soji first refuses to trust her new "friends". Troi, Khestra and Picard all have to join forces to make her feel welcome and earn her trust. Troi can feel emotions in Soji and in one scene talks to Khestra in a telepathic way of communication, like Lwaxana did to her in TNG.!&lt;  &gt;!\- Soji finally tells her new friends about her dream in the previous episode. Khestra is able to google the planet that Soji saw in her mind when she "looked up", while the adults were still guessing which planet could it have been. The A-plot ends with the decision of Picard and Soji to travel to this planet. Rios, who was able to get away from Narek, is picking them up at the end of the episode.!&lt;

Ahh are you new or something? Were you not here doing the saying it in private debacle, when Destiny wrote a 50 page long reddit post about how everyone was lying and misrepresenting the points all because he wants to say the nword? Including saying Trihex couldn't think for himself and that Hasan gaslit the whole situation?
Tell him the last three sentences. Maybe he’s acting like this because he’s scared. Wanting to become a father and actually becoming one are two very different things, especially at 22.  You need him to step up, and if he’s not willing to take steps to try, you have to do what’s best for your baby, even if it means building a life without him. Make it clear to him that while you don’t want that, he’s making you really doubt if you can depend on him.

I think a lot of people don't understand what Drive to Survive is actually about. This isn't a show about formula 1 and all the details that happen on track. It's a show about people and the behind the scenes that we don't get to see play out on track. It's also not a season review, which is what a lot of people seem to be treating it as. It's a goldmine for what it is when you approach it as a show about people/dynamics in the F1 world.

I don't want to deal with someone that has mood swings like that. It's not really worth it, especially if they aren't on meds.  Besides, I'll likely rarely see the mom. She's going to be working a lot. Unless she's my girlfriend or something? In which case, I wouldn't care at all because I signed up for this.   If I'm dating the woman, I'm willing to help out with the kid. I love children and I'd brush the little girl's hair and help with homework.
The issue with solder is that they will give off lead fumes when using them. Machining leaded alloys don't have that same issue and are easier to machine since the lead acts as a lubricant allowing for faster machining/processing due to less heat from friction. I wouldn't want leaded bronze for my drinking pipes but if I had a fan bearing it wouldn't be an issue.
Lmao, I would react the same if people were spilling absolute bullshit as well.
Thank you

Your really close and dont need to buy anything just a little adjusting!   On the stock loop it around the top through that slot around the tube. Get it real tight   On the front take about a 6inch piece of 550 cord and tie a little loop about 2 inches  around one of the little plastic bridges (little spacer piece) between the mlok slots. Loop the front of your sling through that   Get her all adjusted up and use a little tape to keep the tails out of the way!

Thank you. Did not know the term War Hammer was anything more than a huge fictional fantasy following. The name makes sense to me for this weapon. More humane than a lot of other methods of murder used at the time, in my personal opinion.
Ok, but battlefield is about squad play and having 32 different markers on one map wouldn't make sense. I'd be fine with 2d spotting coming back. Just not 3d.

While it is stupid, it had to do with the sound of the word and not the content of it. If the word has feminine vowels, it's feminine. Useless? Yes. Stupid? Probably also yes. But it's probably got more to do with the melody of the sentence than anything else. Gendered languages can sound really beautiful because of it.

Blink twice if MSNBC is holding your family hostage Chris.  Chris Hayes occasionally still shows he actually understands things and has the capability for independent thought. Unlike Maddow who groomed him, he hasn't entirely lost his mind following Trump's election.

What you and i are saying is the same in essence. In your case, you have been harmed, and in response, have turned to a group not involved in your conflict (the government) and asked them for protection in return for your vote and your taxes. Once the government has taken his means of harming you, and others like his, they will become powerful enough that they will not need you vote as no one else can challenge them for power.  In my case, someone harms you and you have the power to regulate them. If its the CEO of a large company - strike, if its an mugger - whip out a gun etc. Police, medicare, an army, and other social services will exist and have vast amounts of power, however, they will never have enough power that they control all parts of your life.  We both agree freedom needs to be regulated, but we disagree on whom should regulate the power.

My name is Horseshoe centrist. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the eastern section of central city, though i see no difference between east and west. I work as a leader of the anti centricide, and I get home at the exact same time everyday. I see no difference between smoking and drinking.   I'm in bed at the exact same time every night, and I make sure i get at least 8 hours of sleep, though there is no difference between sleeping and being awake. After having a glass of moderately lukewarm milk and doing 20 minutes of stretches, I have no problem sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. Or maybe i do, I really can't tell. I was told that each and every one of my bones was twisted into the shape of a horseshoe at my last checkup.   I'm explaining that i'm an ideology that wishes to live a very moderate life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning or losing, although i see literally no difference between those two things. Sticking my head in the sand and ignoring the world's problems keeps me from losing sleep at night. That is how i deal with society, and i know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight, I wouldn't lose to anyone.

In my experience (using ddg for half a year or so) google is better at interpreting weird, one of a kind searches, like if I remember something from my childhood or whatever and try to describe it. Other than that it's pretty similar.
I'm not really following your point?  How does giving the campus media a seat on the table censor them?

I would uS3 the CW app  first as they have most of it on there. I would watch it first to see what you think and if you like it they have all 5 hours coming out on Arrow’s final season (as I think they will for all the Arrowverse shows on Blu Ray). Or if you have an apple device then you can buy each hour separately if you want.  ‘’Personally that was one of the most messiest crossovers they’ve ever done and I thought “Legends Of Today” &amp; ”Legends of Yesterday“ was bad.

Pick a city or state in between where both of your families of from so you can experience something new, and nobody has the upper hand.  Living closer to one side of the family is always going to happen in a relationship. My brother lives closest to his wife's family, my sister lives closest to my family, I live closest to my boyfriend's family (by about 6000 miles!). It's just something you have to deal with. But if neither of you can choose, then do neither - live in an entirely new state.  My boyfriend and I have spoken about what we can do to ensure that our kids see and know my family. It would include long holidays in the UK every summer and winter, regular video calling with cousins and grandparents, and maybe even an exchange program so they can study in the UK for a little bit. We've even had conversations about where I would give birth because of citizenship 😂  To be honest, I would recommend for the sake of your girlfriend, it would be fairer for you to live closer to her family. This is because women go through a lot during pregnancy and after a child is born, and grandparents tend to be closer to the daughter's children, than the son's.

If a woman came here claiming she was sexually harassed/assaulted no one would dare pick holes in her story and say the stuff people are saying here.  There's a huge bias and double standard and it's disgusting.
But don't forget to divert power to the screen first.
I'm doing an MPhil at Cambridge and I won't lie to you - the teaching quality is very low at master's level. I did my BA at a much lower ranked uni and I feel that it actually was of a higher quality as a course than Cambridge in any given year. The MPhil's here really are just money-makers/chances for people to create good networks before pursuing an academic career. In short (and to be brutally honest), the master's courses are not worth the money - especially if you've already done a master's. I have met many students who feel the same way in many different programmes. But if you have enough income to pay for it with ease, why not I suppose. Just keep in mind that it really is more about paying for the name of Cambridge than really doing much to help you intellectually imo. But it's what you make of it.
going 100% raw (no condoms, no BC) the first time is the WORST way to go unless you are okay with the possibility of getting pregnant right away. definitely start off with condoms, at the very least.   get used to each other and sex with each other, and also learn how your own body reacts to sex as well. then you can start talking about alternative methods (BC, pull out method which i don’t recommend on its own..but w/e)  you have EVERY RIGHT to ask him to wear a condom. i i don’t trust any man who would risk pregnancy/STDs rather than just wearing a damn condom. i understand it doesn’t feel as great, but it feels even less great when she hits you with that “i’m late” text
Sexy!!

You could give Gunnar Kaiser a go. I haven't listened to many of his videos but he seems to have interesting topics. I think he is a philosophy teacher at a high school. Here he talks about Jonathan Haidt's book 'The Righteous Mind': https://youtu.be/KyyxSJiPuCY

Ah, I see. I think I have some pretty strong DPS units to bring. Two XWQL (2.6K+ SPR) and two Elena (2.6K+ ATK/MAG), I can bring two of either unit.   Only concern is Asura's 5-turn damage mitigation. Suppose that I bring AWoL and I wait till her damage mitigation wears off, then by the time I plan to attack, then she would've been blinded several times, thus raising her immunity.  Even if I attack during the first 5 turns, no matter how strong my DPS units are, they will barely do damage due to the damage mitigation. During the 1 star battle, I've seen her re-cast her damage mitigation before it wore off. In another case, I've seen her re-apply it shortly after it wore off.  Other units in my party are Lenna (healer/support) and Emperor Foo (support, Esper).
Oh, just realized. Editing title.
Yeah I love their videos XD

Many black people including myself love BHM because it's the one of the year that we get to celebrate our culture. You may not see it, but many people are advocates for teaching more black history in school too. Just because you havent seen it, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. BHM doesnt take away from that mission. If anything, it highlights the amount we dont learn in school.

Why do you have to redefine what it means to be a woman? Every woman is different, yes, but most of us have been sexually harassed and/or assaulted. Why is it so important for trans women to be “real women” when they are not biologically women nor grew up as a female? I see this to be more of a male dominance trait. Women are not men and men are not women.   I find it a bit odd even men and trans women try to explain to women what womanhood is or how other women aren’t like xyz. And using intersex women to prove your point does nothing to back your argument. Intersex people are not your pawn to be used nor are the trans. They are people with a sex disorder and usually comes with many more issues than just an identity crisis.
Retro Studios wanted to conclude the Prime series with a bang. Hence, why Prime 3 feels very different from previous games. More action-packed, more cinematic, more side-characters, etc. I still found it very fun, and the way they expanded the Metroid universe while also treating Samus with utmost respect, is a treat!  Definitely give it a 2nd shot. Just be aware that you're likely not gonna find it as amazing as Prime 1 or 2.
Especially if you have Opening Shot on there.

Check out Restoration Hardware and CB2 for deck furniture that sounds like the style you are going for. If you find something you like at those places, first look at Wayfair and AllModern to see if you can find a cheaper knockoff. West Elm is worth a look too.  Plan for a privacy screen for that section that looks at your neighbor's balcony. You could do tall shrubs in cement planters here, or a trellis with crawling plants (fake or real).

*Can* alien life exist? Sure. If we assume that the universe is purely homogeneous (in a different sense from the cosmological principle), and if we assume that physical causality is the driving force of all things, then it would make sense to assume that we are part of a large "ring" (sphere) of habitable conditions emanating from the centre of the universe (big bang). At our current time, our galaxy might be one of many which has the exact same kinds of worlds that house us.   We might be on Earth #69, out of the thousands of exact replicas of Earth and life there. There might be another version of me, writing this exact comment on Reddit in every other Earth out there, right now.  The alternative is that the universe was never purely homogeneous at all, and we are unique to this particular universe.  Either way, I can't say I believe in one or the other without evidence.
Holy shit.  TIL Presidential elections are always on leap year.
From CNN:  "Around half of South Carolina Democratic voters say the next president should return to Obama-era policies, while around 3 in 10 would prefer they be more liberal, according to early exit poll results.  Only about 1 in 8 want the next president’s policies to be more conservative than former President Barack Obama’s.  More than half of voters in South Carolina Saturday said they attend religious services once a week or more, while another 2 in 5 attend occasionally. Almost 1 in 5 never attend religious services.   Showing the differences in South Carolina compared to the race's first three states, 51% in New Hampshire said they never attend religious services."  Discuss.
Because they want mini-mes and it's easy for them. Even if the woman keeps working she will do most of the work include birth and breastfeed

&gt;Ok but what about those that don't. How is a trans woman that doesn't have the necessary biology differ from a cis woman that doesn't have the necessary biology.   Ok so if a 20 yr old female has never menstruated that is a sign her body is not functioning properly for whatever reason. She would need to head on over to the dr because amenorrhea is often a symptom something is going on.  We would never expect a 20 yr old male (even with a trans identity) to menstruate  So they are defo different cases.

Last I heard it is perfectly legal to withhold aid. Bush did it, Obama did it. It is within the power of the executive branch to make that decision. What "may" be illegal is if it was used to damage Biden specifically.

Yes. Samples from her are being tested in both provincial and national labs. It’ll be a few days before we know with any certainty.   Wash your hands frequently with soap and water.   Cough or sneeze into your elbow.   Avoid excessive touching of your face especially around nose and mouth.   Odds are most people will be perfectly fine. This is a serious thing but, so far, is pretty easy to avoid.
That's a bummer. Inspection always takes swabs from spots that are notorious for not being scrubbed well too. We actually have a printed guide like this one above every sink in the building. I think these should be in all public bathrooms and schools too.

No, but what I am saying is, I might still be able to find a man who can look past that and still want to be with me.  I understand why it would be too much for some people. But also, my capacity to love is huge and I don’t fully define myself by what I have done for money.
Why do Carr haters think we see him as a god? Most of us acknowledge he has some severe flaws that piss us off too! But with a team devoid of talent we just feel he is not the biggest problem right now. We want the rest of the team to get better without upending a position that is at minimum,  stable.

Yeah but it also was an hilarious case since it was a contest with multiple winners, which I participated myself in too with another Nanatsu fanart I did, and both the one I sent and the stolen artwork were almost right alongside each others on the result list. The stolen artwork was also not very well copied and still got among the winners too lmao.  As long as there isn't some actual money made out of it there isn't much point in getting too angry about it. I'm not the kind of guy who really mind if an artwork I did is reposted on another site without a link too (my signature still helps fixing that also).

It's a shame and the ironic part is that most of their developers probably support legalization or are users themselves.   I follow a couple of channels outside of Sneaky Pete/Troy and they had to change their profile to be personal accounts that talk about weed instead of fully weed channels.

&gt;67% of Hindus and 33% of Muslims will make it a majority in India amongst the whole populace.  That doesn't mean other minorities don't exist. Minorities, including Muslims (whether justifiable or not is another thing) have special privileges due to their decreasing population and eradication of culture, however slow it is. There are Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains (I am one), Parsis, Bahai's, who are as important minorities and cannot be ignored.

I cannot stress how much I love the Song of the Lioness quartet by Tamora Pierce (and the subsequent tie-in series that are all just as good). They’re about badass women and girls and they’re super feminist and the original series was written prior to Harry Potter but weren’t as popular because *cough* strong female lead and period talk *cough*. My French teacher gave me the first one as a gift in 8th grade and I’ll love them for the rest of my life.

I just wish they would acknowledge it at all. Thankfully it's still on their streaming services. But you can't buy the 7", can't buy the cd, can't buy lossless files, won't play the songs live, members barely mention them online, and so on. I realize there's a huge quality jump in more ways than one, between this and USAD, but this is still good, I don't think they should hate it so much.

Vapid wasteful consumerism. People will spend so much on shitty things like those ugly pop vinyls which just sit there.  This also includes the smartphone and home appliance industries. Built in obsolescence. Few serviceable parts. Most home appliances have a lifespan of 6-12 years. Yet washing machines from the 70s can still operate if they are looked after. Chest freezers from the 1960s can still function.   I know some people talk about this, but it's resource wasting for capital. It really bugs me

He was asked a question about their offensive strategy in the fourth quarter, and he answered it honestly. I don’t see how that’s shit talking unless you think he was just going at Harden out of malice when otherwise he would’ve gone at AD or LeBron.   If Harden was asked the same thing and said their strat was to attack Giannis I wouldn’t consider it shit talking either (except that doing that would be moronic anyways).   The “can’t pass” thing though, yeah he was definitely having some fun at Harden’s expense.

Nah, it’s just that white Americans are mostly too lazy to do a STEM program. They just accept that their kids will settle into mediocre office or retail jobs and don’t push them to do hard work, especially math.  Whereas for immigrants, your choices are ‘Doctor, lawyer, engineer, or disgrace.’ Amy Chua’s ‘Marching Song of the Tiger Mom’ and other commentaries on the differences between ‘Asian’ and ‘American’ parenting are insightful.
&gt; Warren receiving assistance from Persist PAC is disappointing and it goes against the values of her campaign but I don't think it undermines her credibility.   I think it does undermine her credibility to some extent... just a few months (weeks?) ago she was saying that she wouldn’t accept “a dime” from a super PAC. She used that as a talking point, saying that every other candidate was using one (Sanders “super PAC” was a nurse’s union, Yang’s “Math PAC” was worth like $20), and then flipped overnight when she was given a massive ad buy from a super PAC with undisclosed donors.   She’s still the second choice for me and probably most other Sanders supporters, but optically it looks like it fits into a pattern of willingness to compromise on core ideals. She made a big deal out of not accepting help from super PACs, accused others (sort of falsely in some cases) of relying on them, and then accepted 7-8 digits in spending

The face masks won't help you from catching it, that isn't their purpose/how they work. The sick/infected are the ones that should wear them, it prevents them from spreading it when coughing and sneezing and the such.   You aren't going to breath it in and even if you could the mask isn't secured enough to filter all the air through the mask, most the air you are breathing with it on is going to be coming in through the gaps. Your most likely infection point is going to be from your hands on a surface that has has been touches by an infected person whose hands had snot or spot from coughing or sneezing.   Hope you are ok and thankfully you are in a situation with your job and what not that you can self quarantine. Also thankfully you have the good sense to do so.
NTA. Even my three year old understands to leave other people’s stuff alone. Your sister needs to parent her fucking kids. I’d get an Amazon locker or PO Box for the time being to keep your mail safe.

&gt;First off, licensing requirements are not minimal. They require a passing stepwise examinations and staying up-to-date on required CME hours. What else are you expecting?  They are minimal.  Furthermore, something i forgot to mention, is that most continuing education is paid for by drug companies. That's how we had tens of thousands of doctors still believing "oxycontin isn't addictive" and "xanax is ok for alcoholics" as late at 2010.  \&gt; Are you arguing that we shorten medical school, or that we combine undergraduate education with medical school?  Yes to both. More residency and field experience, less school. Allow for field experience to replace undergraduate education. Undergrad, IMO, is pointless. Everything learned in undergrad should be learned in high school, or skipped completely. We don't teach these things in high school because we have to slow our schools down to accommodate the lowers common denominator. I am also an advocate of home schooling, for those capable of it.  \&gt;That will just discourage rounded students from applying because they are not certain what they want to do.  That's the point, and also the problem we are trying to solve. We don't need undecideds becoming doctors. Most nurses are not undecided, as they begin their nursing programs very early in undergrad. It's a calling. it needs to be a calling. instead, most doctors get into it because of the income potential. They get locked into a track they aren't interested anyway because it's too late to turn back by the time they figure out what they want to specialize in. So that's how we end up with a massive oversupply of plastic surgeons and speech pathologists and a massive shortage of general practitioners and trauma surgeons, arguably the two most critical positions in the healthcare field.  My doctor is someone i can trust. Why? because she wanted to be a doctor but couldn't afford med school, so she joined the marines and became a medic. Then became an EMT firefighter, then a paramedic, got a nursing degree, then a nurse practitioner license. Then her own patients, myself included, recognized her talent and raised enough for her to finish her doctorate. THAT is a doctor. Some spoiled kid who got bullied into college by his counselors or parents then figured out they could make alot of money if they go to med school after three years of partying, should never be a doctor, and never will be a doctor no matter how many credentials you tack onto the end of their name.  \&gt; Not trying to harp on my rad friends either, there is no way I could do what they do.  You should at least have a basic understanding to be able to step in and notice when they are making mistakes. Because i can assure you, those people likely could do 90% of your job for you should you suddenly drop dead in the middle of a critical procedure, and they are mostly competent enough notice your mistakes. Cross competency is important in eliminating the chance of negligent mistakes. We have incredibly high rates of malpractice in this country - almost all of which can be traced to a lack of cross-competency and cross-responsibility. Things are too segmented, as you say, and too much information falls through the cracks on both personal and institutional levels.  \&gt;  Do you really want your primary care provider managing your ventilator settings or performing a heart cath.  If you do not understand how to do this as a doctor, i would not trust you to become my doctor. The nurses should be better at it, but you should be competent at it as well. Otherwise, see above point about catching each other's mistakes.  \&gt; Your argument that they are the only ones on the front line treating patients is just as ridiculous.  i've been hospitalized three times in my life and i never met the doctors who handed down my diagnoses. They were always a mysterious character in a back office. And their diagnosis was wrong, all three times. I saw other doctors during my stay, but their jobs seemed at best, symbolic. Sign on the dotted line, make sure meds are proper, do some bedside compassion moves, onto the next patient.  &amp;#x200B;  \&gt; Certainly if I was the only physician on an island I would do whatever I felt like I could  Our healthcare system is fragile, and will be easily broken by this virus precisely because you have spent your entire life assuming you will never have to assume the role of "sole physician on the island".  \&gt; Generally, in medicine very few people are searching for new ways to treat things, because if they do this they are abandoning the established ways to treat things. Certainly there is bench research being done, and ongoing research studies, but a lot of these research studies are poorly designed and full of bias. That is why we generally wait for the standard of care to change.  All bets are off when lives are at stake and time is limited. This applies to epidemics of novel or rare diseases more than anything else. And it is in these times of crises, that you will be truly tested for your worth. There are years when weeks happen, and there are weeks when years happen.  \&gt; Medicine is so vast, which is why we have specialties. There is too much medical research and knowledge to try and learn everything.  Of course you can't learn everything. But there is value in being well-rounded. Otherwise you can't see the forest from the trees, and fail to apply occam's razor - and that's a trap (judging by your response) that you have fallen into as well.
Nope,they are insulting women who choose not to be housewife and actually want to make something of their life. I can't expect much honest from a guy who made a thread about wanting to punish people for not having kids because "muh Western birthrates".

You just described so many jobs out there. I disclosed I experienced suicidal ideation (though not in the past year, more like 3+ years ago), and I had many hoops to jump through during med clearance. Trust me, I know how much it hurts, but the reality was that I had to keep my options open if I was eventually denied. There are many careers out there that check off everything that you mentioned because while Peace Corps is very intersectional, so are many other international development or even just smaller community development orgs. I am also concerned that if you have this high of expectations for PC service that you take a closer look at how volunteers’ work can wildly vary from what they expected. I’m not saying PC isn’t fulfilling or it isn’t great, but It’s hardly the idealistic panacea you imagine.

Most common goldfish can grow up to a foot long this would require around 50 to 60 gallons for them to properly and comfortably move, also to small of a tank for any fish can cause their bodies to stunt in growth causing their organs to outgrow their bodies causing premature death and an uncomfortable life, hence why it lived for 2 years instead of the average 5 years plus for a betta fish. Go ask r/betta or r/aquariums and get their opinions.

I never understood the love for Trump, especially by Christians. Trump does the exact OPPOSITE of what Jesus preached. He's a rich, selfish, narcissist who doesn't care about anything or anyone other than himself. "Those who exalt themselves will be humbled. Those who humble themselves will be exalted."  Trump has cheated on every wife he's had and he's alleged to have raped a teen girl along with Epstein. Trump is the fucking anti-Christ. And yet, Christians in red states proudly wear their MAGA hats.

I think that sitting in a small enclosed space with you and a buddy and both planting a mine, in a game mode with only one life is a cheap way to play. Not sure if you’ve ever been to that spot in the map, but any direct sight line to that would have triggered the mine to begin with. I think this is a fair counter to a play style that already gives you a significant advantage over other players.
Lmao that was so perfectly synced up. This has been awesome!

Thank you for taking the time to reply, that’s exactly what I told him. That’s shes so concerned with getting a “fresh start” and moving up here that the 4K could go to better use for his nephews. He denied her request for the 4K by saying he doesn’t have that kind of money to which she texted him replying that she saw his bank account and knows he has that much and he’s confused because he had taken her link with his account off awhile ago so he doesn’t know how she would’ve known that so we have to go to his bank on Monday and check that out. He agrees that if she asks for money he should rather just buy grocery’s or clothes specifically and not just give her the sum to do what she want a with it.

I’m kind of indifferent to this.  I think cabins should be 100% assigned by sex. Changing the names of things, meh whatever.  Changing the uniform so everyone can wear anything I’m  completely in support of.  Something just feels off to me about this though and I can’t put my finger on it.  I don’t see the point of dividing activities by sex but at the same time I don’t like the idea of pretending sex doesn’t exist.  We’re a sexually dimorphic species and I think we should acknowledge that while still letting boys and girls do what they want.

Looking at the CS department...
It was one of our weakest spot and he is covering it fantastically, that is why he is a starter very time. He gives consistency to our back line and helps in the attack too. In fact last week he got a goal, we are very happy with him and being a Basque player makes it even better for the fans. I would say that he is also happy being so close to home
yeah it would.

I don't have a Wingman, but I do have the Wave(Similar size/weight of the Wingman), and Surge. Honestly it boils down to what your needs are. I wouldn't say there's a fair way to compare the full-size of those with something like the Style; closed the Style is only 3" and weighs little more than an ounce.  Quality wise it's every bit what you'd expect from a Leatherman tool, but stripped to the minimum. The Style CS doesn't even have pliers, the main tool is a medium/small scissors. They also have the Style PS, which has a small pliers and swaps the knife for a small scissors.  I personally don't need pliers on the regular, or the added weight of a full size multi-tool. And as cool as the Skeletool looks I prefer having a solid set of scissors handy. I'd say if you prefer having a full size tool the Wave sets the bar for use, and comfort.
not what you want clearly,  but reading your post the first thing that came to my mind was the Yandere queen.  Yuno Gasai from Mirai Niki xD  Sociopath and insane, kill people like nothing and all she care is being with yuki lol

Dry papery taste is almost always associated with under extraction. For 330g 2 min is pretty fast, especially with that much agitation. In my experience agitation will slow down a brew time.  Try knocking the grind size down multiple notches, should help quite a bit.

Girl I'm 25, short and pale and curvy, very cute girl next door vibes (not the sexy model type), and I have an STD that I list in my profile. I have no problem pulling men!   There's a type out there for everybody, and while of course most sugar daddies are going to want someone they're attracted to, I've found that having a reasonable, easy going personality, treating people and their time with respect, and being pleasant and enthusiastic far outweighs being hot for most men seeking.  Congrats on your m&amp;g! Hope it leads to a flourishing arrangement! 💕✨

3. ***Knowing how the fucking roles work.*** People not knowing this has been the death of me for too long. My most commonly seen mistakes:  * Vampires don't ping as suspicious to Sheriff. Neither do Witches, Arsonists, or Plaguebearer/Pestilence. * Vet, Medusa, Crusdader, and Ambusher don't block actions. A Veteran who killed the Blackmailer will still be blackmailed. * Just because one person is found to be good/evil on a corresponding Psychic vision does not necessarily mean that the other person/people on the vision are confirmed to be the opposite. Two people (or even all three) on an evil vision can be evil, and both people on a good vision can be good.

Someone once reported me to a manager because they didn't like that I had my hands behind my back when talking to them. I think that was the dumbest complaint I've ever had.
I like that she doesn't take shit from men. she has always struck me as the kind of person who would rather do what feels right to her than make sacrifices to be "likable" to the audience. I think she easily could have won Juan Pablo's season if she hadn't freaked out and told him off for speaking to her in a disrespectful way. She wasn't down for that. I think she's a little dramatic in moments, but she will be a serious lead who wants to find a lasting relationship and will stick up for herself while doing it. Rachel is one of my favorite bachelorettes for that reason and I'm looking forward to that energy!
Well said.  I agree.
Generally the closed account will remain on your credit report for 10 years if it was in good standing. So you shouldn’t see an immediate hit to your credit — other than how the decrease in available credit might affect your utilization.  You could try calling and asking them to waive the fee. If they do, keep it open another year. If not, close it.
I didn't assume any of these things as you've stated them.. I'm not going to clarify myself.   Maybe not young,  but you're obviously immature. You can't spell,  you don't have a clear point,  you're resorting to insults and passive aggressive advice..  You haven't read what I said man,  you're ego is filtering your reality.   You don't have an answer to my question because what I shared about ketamine is accurate,  and your disagreement is total nonsense.

I've been listening to a lot of Chapo Trap House recently. It is definitely not for everyone, and the humour is a bit edgy, bit "broey", but I like that they eschew so called civility, and how they eviscerate both centrists and the right wing.

Consider checking out [my other images on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cosmic.speck/) if you'd like.   This image was taken at a remote observatory I work with known as Deep Sky West at our new amateur observatory open in the Atacama Desert of Chile! While we don't have any data available to the public from it, you can download some of our older [data sets here](https://deepskywest.com/give-away/)  _______________  This galaxy, known as Centaurus A recently had a small jet discovered in within it [by a team of scientists in 2017!](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/474/3/4056/4609363) The jet, which is being shot from the galaxy's black hole, as a whole is broken into 3 distinct portions. Jet A, B, and the most recently discovered portion, C. The paper above used 50 hours on a 2.2 m telescope to achieve an image of the 'C' jet, but they also had help from an amateur astronomer named Rolf sunk *130* hours into the target as well. Sadly though, even after 130 hours, still no C jet emerged. Rolf's image is by far the deepest I have ever seen someone expose on this target. [I made a comparison image between all three being my own, Rolf's, and scientist's who discovered the jet](https://i.imgur.com/TfGGXFX.png).   One of the most interesting things I find in the posted image though, is [the additional red to the bottom of the galaxy. Are these additional jets?](https://i.imgur.com/3IoUG3G.png) Possibly, but I am not sure. Sadly, scientist tend to focus on the known jet region for observations, so professional views of the lower area are lacking currently. Maybe this will go from the first amateur image of the C jet, to the first image of jets that were considered undiscovered.   The equipment that went into this image was a Takahashi TOA-150B telescope and an FLI16200 camera using HαLRGB filters for a combined total of 67.5 hours. While these are definitely expensive pieces of equipment, they are still considered amateur pieces in the scientific realm amazingly enough. Mainly due to them being available to consumers, and equipment of this quality is generally not suited for serious observations where as scientific observatories cost *millions* of dollars, not thousands.   Thanks for looking!

I like how he handled his situation, could’ve bitched up a storm like some many other athletes do when things don’t go their way but Kenta was always respectful. These Japanese guys move different I like it.   With Rich Hill and Kenta in Minnesota finally have an AL team i can support.
I'm 17 and I had to get the nerves of MANY of my teeth extracted because the cavities were just too bad. And about 3 weeks ago I almost had my TOOTH extracted because the cavity was under the gum or somethin like that.

Well, I wasn't addicted to a drug, per se, but I *was* addicted to Diablo 2.  In hindsight, I was absolutely addicted to that game.  I would play it daily for 12-18 hours nonstop.  I would take breaks to eat, use the bathroom, etc.  After 5 or 6 years of that, it just dawned on me that I didn't like it.  I wasn't enjoying myself.  I did everything that could have been done in that game hundreds if not thousands of times.  So, I just stopped playing.

Most commonly it's used as a fake cure for autism that will apparently remove supposed heavy metals from a child's body.

Ok, this is ABSOLUTE fucking bullshit. I went to take a test in class yesterday, and when I saw some sexy looking quadratics, my boner engaged. When I found the y-intercept of the equation, I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using whip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and the teacher got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on a classmate. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. He should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over him, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the teacher didn't agree with me. She KICKED ME OUT of the classroom, and I didn't even finish taking the test. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my cum after it already dried out and solidified on the carrpet. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean dried cum? You CLEAN cum after its FRESH out of your dick, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT quadratic on a test? Either make the equations less sexy, or LET ME jack off in your classroom, asshole.  *I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A classic application was using stat mech based simulations to compute phase transitions in the [Ising model](http://stanford.edu/~jeffjar/statmech2/intro4.html). From this you can infer similar applications in condensed matter simulations, though I do not know too many details there.   An application that I have recently seen a bit of discussion on is applying statistical mechanics to evolutionary models. For instance, I know of a group modelling multicellularity in yeast using primarily ideas from statistical mechanics.

A lot of this to do with how men are socialized. There's an implicit expectation that a boy raised to a man will at some point be balanced out by a woman or wom*en*. Men in same-sex relationships or environments don't necessarily always have that bc to an extent you have to rewire yourself if you've been raised a certain way, not just actively by your parents and community, but in terms of the lessons or ways to behave that you *weren't* taught.  I count me and my brother lucky that our mother insisted we learn certain things before we moved out, and my uncle (ex-military) insisted that sons *and* daughters both should learn self-sufficiency instead of expecting to have someone else to step in to do certain tasks.
The sure SSR ticket has a limited pool Zeta, Carmelina, Melleau, Charlotta, De La Fille or Lady Grey. From these I'd say Zeta and Charlotta are the easiest to use, and possibly the most useful as well. Zeta would be a really really good reroll target, but you  *just* missed her uncap event, she's basically the first gacha SSR to have an uncap locked behind a story event. Sucks I know, this is exibit A of why it was an awful idea. So, if you don't feel like rerolling, there is no need to.  However, if you wish to do so, the [wiki](https://gbf.wiki/Rerolling) has a guide on rerolling. This is a banner with lots of limited units so you can reroll until you get one you like from your newbie 10part (any weapon with "grand" on them unlock limited units, plus Dormius and Rodentius for Andira and Vikala).

This honestly could have been the pel I hooked yesterday. You look away for 1 fucking second and they all converge on your live bait, tried to yank it and he snapped the line with a single and triple hook on it. Poor guy, hope he's alright

I'd say he was complimenting/mildly flirting with her.
Too much culprits and not enough resources to catch and try them. Soon, the changes in geopolitics made this a lesser priority.  For exemple, Heinz Lammerding, the man who massacred Oradour-sur-Glane, died peacefully in his bed in Germany.
Leave Biofrost on engage champs. Dude looks completely lost on tahm kench. First item redemption against a zoe comp (needs qss), takes exhaust against... sett? Who deals almost entirely true damage?

My heart would appreciate that
Broken clocks, Goff and Dalziel are complete pieces of shit.

There’s usually powder in the trees days after the groomers have been skied out. Love the trees!
Sure, but their ages are known, so the data can be transformed back to normal population demographics.

Frame worthy 🙌🏻
It was actually pretty good! Better than last year, imho. I might just be very biased because of the FFVII Remake booth though 😬
I'm not sure.
I'm still thinking fungal. I'd cut off the one leaf and wipe clean the rest of your leaves because I see a bunch of what I hope is dust on them. If you see it growing anywhere else definitely fungal and treat with fugicide.

Might be in your favour to buy the whole system and work something out with that other guy
She did all the steps, but I don’t think the neutralizer was applied very thoroughly and she also later claimed it was a new brand/solution and she “thought it would be gentler because it was organic” 🙄
Isn't Vanta black  a lot different though? It's not really a pigment as much as just molecularly aligned carbon nanotubes, if I am understanding Vanta black correctly.

Thanks! I think my wife might object to FOUR gallons of the stuff! Although she is planning a Hot Ones challenge for me next week for my birthday.

Rather buy Doom Eternal to get my gore fix tbh.
You're a man of culture
Ok ty
I mean it’s more of a meme than art. I love when bitches act all badass on reddit: “girl, have several seats and keep quiet”... LMFAO Why don’t I stand up and give you the facts: before I got my current job Thats very lucrative and very time consuming I painted for a living. Regularly pulling in $3000 per show and selling paintings for 400$-800$ a piece. I am known in my local area for my paintings. So why dont you sit the fuck down and shut up because you’re clearly not an artist, at least not a professional one, you’re just a pathetic RPDR reddit troll.
Yes
He has a point though. Its all confirmation bias to what you believe in.
Nice. I feel 2012 crisis was avoided, as a devastating solar storm missed earth by a week.
Vancouver, Wa. Walmart out of Tylenol and isoprop. People aren't going crazy yet but you can tell there is uncertainty in the air. Dollar tree almost out of bleach, Costco was busier than normal with some people stocking up. Water was going at a good rate.
Unfortunately this is unlikely because we 1. Know where the crater is (Chicxulub) and 2. Can trace the human lineage back to East Africa.  That said, it’s not impossible that a meteorite brought microorganisms from another planet, and that is how life originated on Earth.
Upvoted for truly unpopular. I don't think I agree, but it's not a bad choice either. It's definitely an underrated song, and I really love the concept. Initially i wasn't that fond of it, but it's truly a grower. A very beautiful song that, among their title tracks,  best showcases their vocals skills.
Sauces?
G2 was disappointing though.

👏👏👏👏👏 Out of curiosity was there something that pushed you over the edge? Might be helpful for canvassers
Also, middle should never be 'None'  (a string) but None. (ie, if the student has no middle name, the column in the sql table will be set to NULL).  I don't think your print statement there will handle that.  When you `print(results)` are you getting all the expected students?
Not really. That's his thing now. It's a hybrid MSNBC and DNC. He's edgy.
Thanks!
Make them as lovely and fun as you can!  There's really no mystery to it tbh, if I catch myself picking more than usual I typically don't bother, even though I know I should. A big part of it is also the fact that I pick more when I'm busy/stressed, and when I'm busy I end up shortening my daily routines or skipping things. Not that moisturizing takes a long time but you get what I mean haha
wassup dude
It made sense to landed gentry in 2016 thats why 2016 went how it did
I feel like I entered on another level here.
He actually grew wings and turned into a fucking angel. He then proceeded to scream "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON WHY DO I HAVE WINGS" in a serene shriek.
Why were the streets so wide?
Thank you so much!
I believe they’re coming 4/20 with reformulated ice(I’m serious btw sweetbrown told us this)
I hear whispers mostly, but sometimes I can hear what it's saying loud an clear. Weird thing is that if I try I can control what it says. But when I'm not actively influencing what it says it usually says one or two words over and over or count 1-20, never anything scary or disturbing thankfully

I get that he's the crews cook and all but what happened to the badass man who treated thousands of volts as a light to his cigarette man..  It's not like he was not a cook pre timeskip.

Sure, I did 11 of them in the first week they came out to get Essien. You will need a lot of time to do it though
I walk this intersection daily and see this same accident almost happen or happen once a week. The Miami left!
if all things are equal, yes youre right. that would suck in a vaccuum.   but bungie can also design encounters with the updated sandbox in mind,m not having to worry about if feeding frenzy rampage perks make quick work of challenges they design. think riven cheese.   As long as we feel subjectively powerful, the objective power doenst matter. if the encounters are designed in the sandbox without feeding frenzy rampage, we wont feel it, and it becomes much easier to have way more variety in the game, and no one ever complained about variety.  but if you keep old weapons, to do this design for variety, you have to create things as strong or stronger than feeding frenzy rampage. which leads to power creep.

Hildryn is Queen of Index
We wasn’t created by Disney though, that’s his point. Olaf was. Disney bought Star Wars after jar jar was in existence
Interesting, how do you tell?
Their argument is basically that the amount of sexual partners one has doesn’t negatively affect their ability to love in a relation ship.   Essentially, it’s totally fine for you to not be interested in being promiscuous, but it’s not cool to look down on someone who is. Follow your beliefs on your own, don’t let it impact how you see other people.  Hope this helps break it down a bit haha
