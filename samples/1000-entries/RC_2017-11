OP hasn't explained what standard he used to determine the act is immoral, and you believe morality is subjective. Using your own standard, I see no reason why your view of the Bible should have any more weight than mine. 
This may be weird, but here's my lat pulldown. Am I cheating too much/should be stricter? And I always feel wobbly, should I drop the weight? I can normally do 3x10 with the last few reps being a struggle. https://imgur.com/a/SdzbR

Literally, assuming you're American, US laws blatantly state that harassment is repeated, continuing negative behaviour that specifically intends to cause emotional harm or distress. This extends to sexual harassment - must be repeated, continued, with no consent given or denied, with specific intent to cause distress or harm    Sorry but all these people acting like a single 2 minute conversation constitutes harassment are just flat out wrong.

oh yeah I guess you're right, I'm having a hard time finding any sources saying one way or the other except for on some drug use forums, here is one source, http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/817567-Acid-in-America-2017  I wish I had more time to devote to this tonight because now Im seriously interested. Also I am speaking from the perspective of someone who has been in the scene since I was a little kid so that obviously factors into my perception of availability and purity but, like I said, I can't find anything to refute my claim that the majority of lsd purchased and sent in to places like energycontrol-international.org is lsd.

There isn't really a set timeframe for something like this.  It typically develops over a matter of months or years.  It doesn't pop up in a matter of days or weeks, as it does take some time for the walls of the heart to become thick and juicy.  An EKG is really just a preliminary test for LVH, and isn't all that accurate.  It doesn't give your doctor any indication of the actual thickness of the walls of your heart, measure ejection fraction, etc.  You'll want an echocardiogram to really get some insight into your cardiovascular health.

It's definitely a drag in some respects. Bring all your own food. Bring something to share. Tell some strategic people beforehand that you will be eating your own food if that is an issue. It's not a good time to make uninformed, possibly unsympathetic people try to adhere to GF during holiday/family stress. As you accurately explain, it's too hard to ascertain that others can or will cook properly, and it's a source of potential conflict and gluten. 
Not worried. No way in hell a B1G team with 1 loss is getting left out.
That makes it worse

I do that for a living, but we have harnesses and such, this guy is just an idiot.  We actually have locking doors going up the crane and panels to keep people from climbing up the outside.  Would be insurance hell if someone trespassing fell off one of our cranes.  We were especially cautious after that truth or dare contest movie came out last year.
Wow what dish/ what about the food gave you the ailment? I’m Hawaiian and heart disease is very common in my family and Hawaiians in general. I always thought it was the salt content.
I've 700h in Rocket league on PC. Seriously addicting. I had to stop myself from playing because it was starting to affect my grades. There is virtually no respawn time in RL and you can find a match within seconds, this makes you lose the flow of time completely when you play it.
Wasn’t hard for me at all, but I did go through some other medication first (although I have it prescribed for major depression, which is somewhat unusual). The social workers are also through psych in student health, and I have only made appointments in person, but I’d assume you can call as well?  Good luck.

I got an Xcortech 3200. It's a really nice little thing, and despite negative comments (almost entirely from people who've never seen one in the flesh but who'd spent a lot on a "proper" crono and want to believe it's the only true way) it worked really well, within it's limitations.  Those limitations being, Elites only, and it's a pain in the bum to use, with no app or similar. But it's got no real accuracy detriment over either a shooting crony or my caldwell. So if you're willing to trade ease of use for ease of purchase it's a good option.  I have to say, I'm glad I spent the extra to upgrade- I just found the inconvenience of the 3200 meant I wasn't as keen to use it. I've shot thousands of darts over my caldwell with it all efforlessly logged into the android app, I don't think I'd have done all those shoots with anything less convenient.
Oh lol I remember now! I can’t believe I let that go over my head!

Keep in mind that there's a very non-linear relationship between radius and mass in the Saturn to red dwarf range of objects. This is because at those mass ranges the compressibility of gas is a big factor. More massive objects tend to just get denser and only a little larger. You can see this with our own gas giants. Saturn is about 60 megameters in radius, Jupiter is about 70 Mm, Jupiter has 73% more volume than Saturn but well over 3x the mass, resulting in Jupiter being about twice as dense. That same pattern continues through brown dwarfs up through red dwarf stars. The TRAPPIST-1 red dwarf star, for example, weighs in at 0.08 solar masses and a radius of 79 Mm, making it 84x the mass of Jupiter but only 46% larger in volume.  For reference, Jupiter is roughly a thousandth the mass of our Sun, while this planet is about 80% of Jupiter's mass, and the star is about 62% of our Sun's mass, so there is still a factor of *hundreds* in between the two.

Well as I figured out it is still possible to put a Pokemon between active gym fights. Someone could always spare the timer, even more effective if two or more people are starting the gym fight non-simultaneously to prevent anyone from adding their pokemon.  But that does only apply as long an fight is active. As soon all fights ended a Pokemon can be added. Just happened tonight as someone added Pokemon in the right moment while we were starting the second fight.

What is sad about it, is that our JustNos' marriages did work like that--they kept all kinds of secrets from theie own spouses. SadSickOldPsychopath said to me once that "all she ever wanted" was a marriage like ours.  Ha.  She lied and cheated and schemed her way through four marriages.  I realize now that this was just another lie.  If she had wanted a marriage like ours, she would have put in the work to have it, and not filled her life with lies.  What she wanted when she said this was to get me to think that she and I had the same values, so she could pull another scheme/manipulation on me.   Your SIL is brilliant.

This is so true, and I’ve seen this even with lesser age gaps. I knew a slimy guy in his early 20’s who only dated 18 and 19 year olds. He acted like it was because they were hotter, but the reality was that the vast majority of girls his age wouldn’t put up with his shit and weren’t impressed by his “game” to begin with. Teenagers thought this loser was so, so mature because he was just older.

Just to clarify (because I was surprised Marvel didn't say, *"fuck you, no extension, give us the rights to the movies back"*), Sony exchanged the merchandising rights in exchange for cash in 2011 because their electronics department was suffering - *not* because they needed a movie extension.  [Source:](http://comicbook.com/marvel/2017/02/02/sony-admits-selling-spider-man-merchandising-rights-were-short-s/)  &gt;“We had sold some assets of the studio, such as merchandising rights of Spider-Man, to raise short-term cash in exchange for long-term cash flow when the electronics units were struggling,” [Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony's chief financial officer] said.  I mean, think about it, why would Marvel accept the merchandising rights when in that scenario they could just stonewall and Sony would fail their part of the contract thus giving everything back to Marvel?

Spelunky was listed as coming first to PS4, which generally means timed exclusivity (sometimes because of a deal, or sometimes just because the developer doesn’t have the resources to launch everywhere at once), so I would expect that on Xbox at some point.  I didn’t hear anything about platforms for Guacamelee, so I don’t know what the status is on that.

Typing this up on a mobile so plz forgive any grammar errors.  This is a naval tinker taylor story.  Emma, being the good friend that she is, decides to go wiyh taylor to summer camp after her mother died, and so misses her incident with the ABB and SS. Events progress pretty normally with taylor gradually rebuilding her relationship with her father (possibly due to some Barnes intervention ).   But then everything changed when the Laviathan attacked . Taylor and Emma are in the end bringer shelter that Laviathan peeks his head into. The two of them are swept out to sea by the next tidal wave where Taylor triggers with the ability to craft naval machines (think anything from a sail boat to a submarine or a battleship, as long as it goes in the water) Emma could probably trigger too if you wanted with some kind of suplementary power.   At this point I think it would be best if the girls parents died in the attack. So now "the Admiral " vows revenge against the seamonster that destroyed her home .  Lucky for taylor there is an entire boat grave yard for her to make use of , constructing a fleet of tinker ships, maybe taking over the city ( let's be honest that map of brokton bay is like 60% water plus most of the city is underwater after laviathan so boats and ships would have an easy time of it. )   You could give taylor a cool laser cutlass and a cybernetic eyepatch  :)  Any way being the literature fiend that she is she could start giving Laviathan  the nickname "the white whale" or her "white whale" (also a great fic name) thus begins a Moby dick esq adventure sailing and trying  (maybe sometimes failing) to hunt him down and avenger her father and her city.

No, just honest.  When our "troops" (serial killers) travel to another country that's not invaded us, and set about murdering their citizens, they're not defending out freedom - they're no different from ISIS. Well, actually, ISIS offer a much better short-term return on investment (which is to be expected from an agile start-up military group).  The terrorist attacks on UK soil are all directly related to the murders committed by our troops abroad. They're directly endangering people I care about - both at home and abroad. They should be ashamed of themselves, but let's face it - anyone who thinks that they are doing the right thing killing people they've never met just because some rich bastards tell them to is too far gone to ever feel an emotion like shame.

What you're talking about is the Qattara Depression Project, which aims to dig a tunnel to the depression which is situated at -130 meters.The problem with this project is we don't know how much it will change the surrounding environment. If the area sees an increase in rain, enough of an increase that it will in a decade basically replenish itself, meaning you can no longer use it for hydroelectric power generation. And it would be a shame, as you'd be left with a large toxic lake.   If you'd replenish all these lakes, then you don't want to water from either the Atlantic or Mediterranean, as these lakes won't really evaporate due to their massive size. Do take in mind that Lake Chad was about 1,000,000 km² in surface 7000 years ago. The Great Lakes only make up a 4th of that in size (244,106 km²)  Now do that for all the lakes, what you will create is toxic lakes that are just too salty for most fish to survive, covering an area 16 times the size of the Great Lakes.

What do you believe his strategy for the first half of his first term is? What about the second half?

It’s getting hard to watch now, it really is. We’re not even playing great teams and conceding goals, we’re conceding against below average sides, Roma ok are maybe just above average but still we shouldn’t be losing in that fashion to them , we’ve conceded 6 in 2 games against Roma, 2 against Watford, 2 against palace, this isn’t about players missing or injuries (granted I know they don’t help) this is about the stubborness with the system, the ridiculous transfer policy and contes persistence with certain players who just don’t cut it. I don’t know about anyone else, but I feel like tonight’s tipped me over the edge with this rant. If we’re not careful, we’ll end up a laughing stock like arsenal and Liverpool

My larger point was that it's problematic for historians the same way that it's problematic for scientists when it comes to "science journalism."  Outlets latch on to sensational sounding stories, research, and new scholarship and offer a half-baked explanation of the study and its context.  That's not to say that these press outlets should take all the blame. Historians, like Larsson, are at fault here as well for issuing such press releases for something that clearly lacks solid evidence to back up such a grand argument.

Hydroid isn't really bad anymore...he's just boring.   Oberon is actually really solid after his rework. I wouldn't call him bad now.  Zephyr...yeah. She's objectively the worst warframe in the game. She *desperately* needs a rework. She's kind of fun to play I guess though. moreso on the Plains than literally anywhere else in the whole game though.

The comment in question explicitly states that the doctor patted her breasts *after* the exam. Of course a doctor is going to touch your breasts during an exam, but tapping them like drums (the way, say, my partner would do when we're fooling around or joking) is completely inappropriate behavior from a doctor.

Do what I did in these situations:  "Were having pizza tonight". "I've booked tickets for this movie". "Let's go do this"  Indecision drives me nuts. So I make choices and if my SO is adverse - she can suggest an alternative.  It's a good thing - you get more of what you want!
Not trying to gloat, apologize if it seemed that way. I was just being blunt (Blount) and summarizing the situation. But any Dolphin fan should be a bit angry at this. I know I would be. Well, Eagles have traded a ton of amazing players before so I know the feeling...

Well sounds like your wife needs to learn some horse etiquette and apologize to your nephew. I'm not really familiar with horses so I don't know if this level of transgression is like petting someone's dog without permission or taking it out for a walk without permission, but assuming she should have known better I might also have a serious talk with her about respecting animals/the rules of the stable and if she doesn't seem remorseful maybe she doesn't get to come back to the stables ever.   But in my family swearing is *extremely* disrespectful and I'd expect an apology as well. He was upset and it was in the heat of the moment, but calling my wife "fucking crazy" is unacceptable.

Not gonna check other countries right now, but in US at least, RW is usually a worse threat. Go to bottom of page 4 on this gov analysis of threats to US: http://www.gao.gov/assets/690/683984.pdf  &gt;Since September 12, 2001, the number of fatalities caused by domestic violent extremists has ranged from 1 to 49 in a given year. As shown in figure 2, fatalities resulting from attacks by far right wing violet extremists have exceeded those caused by radical Islamist violent extremists in 10 of the 15 years, and were the same in 3 of the years since September 12, 2001. Of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since September 12, 2001, far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for 62 (73 percent) while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for 23 (27 percent). The total number of fatalities is  Page 5 GAO-17-300 Countering Violent Extremism about the same for far right wing violent extremists and radical Islamist violent extremists over the approximately 15-year period (106 and 119, respectively). However, 41 percent of the deaths attributable to radical Islamist violent extremists occurred in a single event—an attack at an Orlando, Florida night club in 2016.  Although either way, as a percentage of annual death, both are really low.
I'm a Panthers fan but not a Funchess owner in fantasy. I think he very well could grab some of Benjamin's targets and get better.  He has looked to be improving over time, is the same age now as Benjamin was when we drafted him, and is the same size as Benjamin, he will likely be the Panthers big target for years.   The negative is if Samuel steps up as the deep threat and gets way more looks or if the Panthers draft someone next year to fill that slot.   Pretty much Funchess is probably the WR1 on Panthers for ROS and should get solid points this year, but he likely becomes the WR2 eventually (if the Panthers are smart which admittedly they aren't so he may remain WR1 for longer than this year).    So yeah Funchess is probably super worth owning this year, Olsen isn't back yet, Samuel hasn't shown much yet, Funchess is going to be force fed the ball as McCaffrey and him are the entire passing game now.

I've never understood this reasoning, especially with a new engine.  I'm an indie game developer, and I'm using my own game engine, written from scratch.  Once the basic abstraction layers are in place, it's not all that hard to port to Linux.  You'd think that if I could manage that much, Amazon could as well.  Once the port is written and the abstractions are in place, it's really not all that hard to maintain a port.  At least, that's been my own experience so far.  It's true that Linux gaming isn't going to be where huge profits are made, but it seems worthwhile to invest time and effort in your ENGINE, because that allows every game to be ported to Linux with very little effort.  It's a one-time investment which pays off better dividends the earlier you make the effort.  Well, what the heck.  Less competition for me among the Linux gaming community, I guess.

Totally agree. I think it looked beautiful, and had a crazy amount of detail (that oh-so slight print that the bucket left in the mud, the muscles contracting from breathing).   Everything was done in "one shot" whilst someone was choking on a rope the entire time, which made it pretty suspenseful and memorable to me. If it was actual torture porn it wouldn't give any hints on the underlaying conflict between these characters and they'd show a lot more actual gore. It really was just there to set a dark and hopeless mood.

Ye, this is actually pretty stupid.
I think this is fine in most cases, and it is a nice gesture, but if you want an honest opinion, one thing you might consider when choosing an appropriate gift is that unless it's something disposable your therapist will probably feel compelled to keep it and/or display it depending what it is for years, or forever. Even if you're moving 400 miles away, you just never really know if clients are going to come back in a few years, and then when they do, they're like "Hey, where's that clock/picture/trinket/desk toy I gave you? Did you ever use it? Why isn't it on display?" And as a therapist you had better remember what that client gave you and know where it is and ideally have it on display, or else they might think you didn't care about them, like them etc. So sometimes getting gifts is stressful! This is especially hard if you're working with kids, because they'll paint rocks or make something for you and then come back like 2 years later asking if you still have their rock. Then you have to open up your rock drawer... anyway I don't have a problem with gifts on principle, just something to think about
Oh I got it. I debated saying "Stock Bumpers" shouldn't be legal. Then I didn't.

He is probably the most vapid and least charismatic F1 champion ever. And F1 does not need to have celebrities attached to be legitimate. Being the premier racing series in the world is enough. If anything the celebrity part take away from its pedigree as a racing series. If there is something I can't understand is the celebrity cult, 99% of them are entitled pricks with little or no awareness of the average Joe's struggles. The main reason why Ayrton Senna was/is so worshipped in Brazil is precisely because he, despite all the wealth and fame, was, in essence, a normal hard-working guy to which people could relate and even see as an example that hard work pays off. Ironically Senna, the son of a wealthy bussinessmen who never wanted for anything, is more relatable to the common man than Hamilton, the rags-to-riches guy. Perhaps it is because of it though, the millions made from F1 had less impact on a well of guy than it did on a guy from humble begginings.

Enjoyable highlights from a good game, with lots worth seeing:   Raith: 10 Lewis Vaughn. He has just extended his contract for a year. He makes some nice moves during the game. The 9 and 11 are good, too.   Forfar: 10 [David Cox](http://www.forfarathletic.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2&amp;limitstart=20#content) He has an indomitable spirit and lifts the team.   That is a 3G surface there at Station Park. It looked very good. I wonder if they had one with multi-coloured grass. I don't think there were any injuries.   The Forfar mascot at the start of the game looks like he is going to play!   Well done to the multi-media team! Good focus and panning of the camera, and nice to see the selections listed at the start of the game.  I am always curious to see the managers shake hands at the end, and that was there, too.

Exactly, mistakes are hard to admit especially at such a high position. Democrats likes welfare, and people need it but the problem is they haven't thought about a way to educate people on welfare that want to get out the little they get and live a reasonable life without the need of government assistance. On the flipside, Republicans wants everybody to work if possible to get off welfare. Now along with countless number of problems, we're at 20 trillion dollars of debt and when four years are done we will see where the debt is and will probably need another person to help limit the high debt ceiling we have due to the piss poor communication we have

But is there a lack of things to do? The premise is wierd. Before the industrial revolution we spent a lot of time doing work that is no longer needed, but over a little bit of time we found new ways to employ the services of our newfound labour surplus in sectors that wasn't easily replaceable by machines doing things we before couldn't afford to do. What on earth makes you think that won't continue? Do all elderly have the best availiable care? Is our environment pristine? Couldn't many of our basic services be even better with more hands on deck? Etc. Etc. Your talking about solutions for a post-labour future that most likely will never occur as if it is a problem we need to deal with soon. What you need, assuming you live in the US is programs (public or private) that help retrain, relocate and in general mitigate the harm to those whose livelyhoods gets disprupted in the process, not to throw economics as we know it out the window.

There is quite a bit inherently wrong with this. I know I'm just joining the already-in-full-swing party here, but I'll add my voice anyway.   1. You are very young. 18 feels adult, but it's not. Your brain, particularly the part dealing with consequences, has not fully formed, and won't for another 6 or 7 years. You also lack experience, and therefore a firm footing in what is right, and appropriate, and how things should work. There just hasn't been enough time for you to learn those things. (which have nothing to do with intelligence, poise, social skills, perceptiveness, etc.) This leads to:  2. As someone who is 40, and has lived for 22 years longer than you, I can assure you that you and I could never have an equal relationship. This is because I have 22 years more experience than you. I have seen more, made more good and bad choices, and just been through so much more than you that I will think that, with few exceptions, I just know more than you. Even if I were a fool and you were brilliant, in almost every area of our lives, I would just have more experience.  3 So let's look at a person who is 29 years older than you, willing to date you. Let's only look at point 2 first. Why would he be okay with such an unequal power dynamic? Would he say that he does not value his opinion more than yours? If so, why? Did he waste the last 29 years? Did he experience and learn nothing? Then you could be equals...but then why would YOU want to be with someone who wasted 29 years? Or someone who devalues 29 years of his own experiences?  4. Let's say he knows perfectly well you two will have an unequal power dynamic (he does). And let's also acknowledge that he regularly chooses younger partners...And that he knows point 1 is also true, and you are too young to know better, or what is fair, and healthy (which he does)...   It all adds up to something that just isn't good. There is NO WAY it can be good. Either he is taking advantage...or else he is someone who has wasted his life and hasn't grown up enough so that he's perfectly fine dating someone so young. And that's also not someone good enough for you. 
I agree. But China just opens, it has been hitting the 6400 barrier all day and now has broken it. Just pointing that out  is all.
You are lying. Tell the truth. Sometimes it goes flat.
Beat them at their own game by not buying the fucking game to start with.

He's classified as one by the game though. Not saying it's correct, but that's a fact.
They can do whatever they want.  It has happened before.  Not saying it will though 
&gt; Because now they appear to be worth less, so someone will have one drop search the price, see 65c and list it at that so he can then immediately buy it. Repeat this for a while, then relist them all at 140 and you just made 80c per trade.
An old man once made (what I now think to be deliberate) eye contact with me when his balls were literally hanging out of his shorts.  He was smirking.  That’d be bad enough on its own, but I was about 16, and very young looking even then.  
Pitchers complain about the balls every season. Have you never watched a game of baseball before?
oubre for smart?
Well I am glad your friend realizes it. To admit you are wrong is a hard thing to do so I encourage people not to gloat or make the person feel awful when they come to this realization. That way they are on our side. Did your friend explain why he now feels like he fucked up? What is his opinion of Trump now?
Every time they shoot the end of episode scene where Chrisley and his wife are in bed, as soon as the crew yells “cut” Chrisley slowly turns to his wife and says “get the fuck out”. 
Much better :)
All my man has to do is moan Rebecca. I had a friend over 2 weeks ago, he was always quiet before. And I said james do u want to fuck, he said yes Rebecca i haven't gotten laid in 2 weeks. 5 mins into it he said jesus Rebecca I forgot how good ur are. Not quiet either, it was loud, very loud. I got about 10 or 15 rebeccas right in a row, I never had a man moan so loud. I hadn't been turned on like that in a long time, I let him do whatever he wanted at that point. Its hot when a man moans more than me. 
 You miss the point. Verlander would have made their task easier and more likely.  Not that it is impossible for them to win it. However Kershaw showed nothing is certain, even trusting your ace.
Since it was in your contract, hypothetically speaking, if you flunk out of tech school, could they still force you to retrain for a different job?  Also, to get that contract, I assume you had to negotiate that with your recruiter? I would imagine not everyone is allowed to do this
It's free. I had to use the ublock element zapper seven times. If it was a banner at the top I- who I am kidding, I still get rid of it. I *hate* ads and anti-adblockers
Funny you mentioned that because I decided to try to pick the series back up right before that happened. Then it happened and, “Awww, hell naw.”
I don't smoke, but I'd go to the smoke sponson with my buddies anyway and shoot the shit. It wasn't just the 10 minute break, a lot of good bullshiting went on out there.
He's been polarizing for sure, but he's had as many defenders as he's had detractors.  Like last year, there was a post every week on how much for a "pro" Jahlil was.  
Because I sold it
probably not. Rounds tend to "skip" when hitting pavement and continue moving with most of their force. It's best to aim for center of mass and hope most bystanders move as quickly as they can away from the area.

This year for Halloween I encorporated a horn into my costume as an easter egg to dynamicbanter. These boys consistently make me laugh every week and I'm forever grateful for this podcast 
Candyman was awful, and not in the way horror films can be terrible but entertaining. So I'll say the other.
I gave a ride to a guy who works on the onboarding team at Uber. I mentioned to him that I have seen comments on here about lags in getting approved. He said that the process is not fully automated and that very often the delays are caused because county records are not checkable online. Checkr has to send someone to the court house in any county you may have lived in that does not have electronic records. He said typically it takes from 3 days to a month to be approved. Obviously there is something jamming the process in your case. Pay a visit to the Greenlight Hub in your area, they may be able to give you specifics.
A defaced serial number is double the crime of having an unregistered/unlicensed possession.   I think it's 10yrs fed crime to have a defaced serial.  Just saying, know the stakes.
Also guys who are willing to bend over backwards for unreasonable requests often expect the same from you.
I'll take it
She's in a relationship and doesn't like him the same way he likes her. Don't call her a bitch when she's just his friend lol

Wow... And with a CDL license.. He couldn't just get a job driving a truck WITHOUT killing people?
I'm sure it still did the job my dude, however you may have frayed and delaminated the very top threads. This can spread down the steerer over time and fail in a mezmerisingly catastrophic way, especially when the clamping forces from the stem are added, and that will hurt your face a fair amount.

Tragiskt. Jag kan inte låta bli att tänka på svårigheterna på gatan för sjukvårdare att avgöra vilka som är allvärligt skadade och vilka som bär smink.
Region lock on system transfers is enforced by the server, preventing you from transferring across regions. Since the Japanese eshop is inaccessible on American firmware, you can't pull tickets or updates or dlc from it on American firmware, so they block the transfer.
It's okay not to like **Friday**. Everyone likes different things. **Friday** didn't work for you or me, but maybe Sally and John loved it. That's fine. But whether you like or dislike a game, it is very helpful to consider *why* you do or don't like it (see below).  Yes, **Gloomhaven** MSRP is ~$100. The reprint should be hitting retail the end of this year/start of next year, so at the very least don't pay a gouger price right now.  But more importantly, I strongly recommend watching playthrough videos (rather than reviews) of **Gloomhaven** and all games you are interested in. These will give you a more clear sense of what the game is actually about, how the turns happen, what the actions are, and how the game play flows. Looking at these you can more easily judge, 'Yes, those game things look like something I would enjoy doing over and over for 2 hours' or 'No, that's not as interesting as I thought'. Reviews are not nearly as useful for this.   Of course, this is where having a sense of the the games you like/disklike and the reasons for that is what you are comparing the playthrough videos to; For example, **GH** is an RPG, but the video shows a lot of card choosing/hand management and maybe you know that you don't like that as much because of game XYZ that you played. Or it shows you the tactical combat play is the main focus which you love because it's like that other game UVW that you enjoyed. And so on.  You were asking for Christmas list ideas, but long term you may want to acquire your own games as well. Math Trades can be a pretty decent way to build a collection; even if you don't have a ton of great games to offer up, you're allowed to offer gift cards. There are also BGG and reddit exchanges and auctions, the GeekMarket on BGG etc. [boardgameprices.com](https://boardgameprices.com) and [spielboy.com](http://spielboy.com) are great tools to check the prices for games your interested in periodically to get a sense of the average price. That way you'll know if the supposed ''sale'' is really a good deal or not etc. Edit: Also, as a kindness to those who may view my Christmas list, I typically note a ''good'' price for a game just in case they go to Amazon at a bad time (stock is low) and see it listed for 3 x the normal price or something, they'll know to stay away.

I'm doing payment plans at American Music Supply, it'll end up being $550 total. I've been looking at them for a while but didn't know if it was worth it. Realized if I wanted a good guitar that'll see me through my musical career and that'll probably always sound better then I could possibly play I'd need to upgrade from my Les Paul Special II sooner or later, and this was the logical choice. I've always loved the classic look, feel and sound of Les Pauls.

I've got nearly all of the studio albums on my car's stereo, so this question doesn't apply exactly. But there are a few albums where I think, "Oh, no. It's THAT one." But I listen to it anyway, and there's always something wonderful. Particularly, I am unsatisfied with Black Tie, White Noise, but when I'm listening to something like "Looking for Lester", I remember why I keep the album in rotation.

I tried that years ago but I had no idea what I was doing so I went back to the pill...lol And then I did nothing for a while, got a little nervous, and got the Nexplanon. Which I can't wait to take out...ugh.
To me, it feels like a tired feeling. A feeling of wanting to lay down and sleep forever, or to go to sleep and wake up somewhere else, maybe as someone else with a different mindset. Bring alive is a weird experience. But it's the only experience we've ever known.
He was shit for me, sold him after few games without regrets.

Ok but those games aren't all under one section...
No, but he didn't have to try particularly hard. The second task shows there's no contract preventing you from failing, as Fleur demonstrates.
Ah yes Sterasaurus!!!!.....no one calls him that plus i dont know anything about him, but anyone is better than Morelli.
I recently got in touch with Cam regarding the exact same thing. Honest answer is they're behind on orders and trying to catch up. Mines been about 5 weeks.   It's funny because I was sort of doing this as a "maybe I'll finally stop ordering from cubicle all the time even though I've had so many problems" test.   Bad timing I guess.

Not my fault they're incapable of doing some of their own basic research. Like searching terms along the lines of `poverty rate` `food stamp recipients` or looking up the endless march of this country from 'every generation is better off than the one before' to this shitshow we have right now. Internet. So hard use. How wikipedia work? How google work? How government websites with statistics work? oh ma fuckin gerd how it work.  I cited an easily verifiable phenomenon, it's not even hard to look up.
Thank you for answers and I'll specify. Now I'm Bucharest. Tomorrow I'll be in Ruse and I'm going towards Turkey. I'll cross the country vertically in the east. Things I'm most interested in are nature (I've seen you have caves and cool cliffs) and random accidents like in Ukraine I got to play a concert and in Romania I got into a newspaper. So this kind of adventures would be really cool, but you can't plan them. They just happen :)

Do you never have to change course/altitude/... during a transatlantic flight? (I don't think I ever did more than 2h and shorter EU flights, so I don't know)
6 has a lot more micromanagement than 5. Personally, I'd recommend 4 or 6. 6 is a lot more active than 5. Where as generally in 5 you could set your build order and keep hitting end turn here you'll have to select buildings every time they complete. Builders have charges and this you can to manage them wisely and make more. War is a bit different too. I've had some people who actually didn't enjoy 5 enjoy 6.   4 is very good. It's a much deeper game than 5 and 6 but there are crazy stacks of units so you lose the element of strategic positioning 
You being unhappy about log bait does not make his win "controversial"  
If you think about it, it's pretty scary they had to do that.
Watch out for boulders.
It's a terrifying prospect, a man who can make Braun look small.  
Kinda new to this but do they add new heroes every month (not including seasonal units)
Wait didnt she have an eyepatch too?   Dont remember too well...  Either way great costume😈👍
Thanks for saying this. I'm a little tired of people expecting a 10.5 million dollar player to be coddled. 
To expand, flush is a term used when 2 planes are lined up on the flat area.  So the fact that you would feel the step up if you were feeling from the door to the rear fender means they aren't flush.  The gap doesn't have anything to do with it, just the step.
I'll be super honest. He's the same person as he was when the series first started. People just know that he's gay now and that he forced himself on a 14 year old male a very long time ago, though didn't go as far as to rape him.   He was and maybe still is a terrible person, but I say just let them finish the season to get closure. They're pretty much almost done. Let's not waste all the time, effort, and money spent on this. If people are worried about Spacey's money earned from this, I'm sure he'll donate it and some. 
Your mistake is not going for the big one from the start.. dont kill the first two , just weave in n out from the getgo and you'll trigger it before the blueberries strike

Last Week: 4-3 • Season: 51-28  - **Syracuse** 30-27 Florida State -- The Orange have had a bye week to prepare and Dungey is a better QB than what BC has to offer. FSU will try to make a stand but falter in the end - **Georgia Tech** 34-23 Virginia -- Bounce-back opportunity for GT after a tough loss in Death Valley - Wake Forest 23-30 **Notre Dame** -- Wake is feisty, but Notre Dame won't let a potential playoff spot slip through their fingers like this - Clemson 30-31 **NC State** -- Y'all knew this one was coming - **Virginia Tech** 27-24 Miami -- Miami's had too many close games down the stretch. VT capitalizes - **North Carolina** 21-20 BYE -- UNC squeaks out a tough one against the formidable bye week. Gotta get those wins where we can baby.
I added your FC. Please add mine.
Yeah I'll purely be gaming fps and heavy modded RPGs and MMOs 
Vikings yes, Rams no imo 
Thanks that’s viable.
Hi
Except for Lindenberg baby and JFK limo those are not very popular ME's imo, and the JFK limo is pretty easily explained as an illusion. Still very few compared to simple misspellings  &gt;What's your take on the FOTL cornucopia?  I don't think it's everyone. Relative to the entire population it's probably very, very few but enough people might associate fruits in that art style with a cornucopia. And even among those few you have to take into account the fact that ME's spread as they become ME's. I'm guessing you found out about the FOTL through the ME crowd and not on your own.  Generally I just apply Occam's razor
If FIFA had a track runner button (like the make run) then sure I'll go 1v1.  I'm left to contain, but if you tried you can beat that defender... You just might. Pulling the AI out of position is easy if you run to the wing, just about everyone I've played online is fast counter cheese sticks through the middle.
This is a problem with esports in general. People who weren't fans of traditional sports beforehand have no idea how to actually fan. Calling for player trades for perceived improvement is one of the most common things in sports, but in esports it's treated the same as wishing the death of a player/team/org.
I'm confused about draw distance, I thought that was a graphical thing. Like I have my draw distance maxed out. I can see objects very far, but I have to get very close to see a player or an enemy. The first video in the post is what I'm talking about. 
haha yeah I meant the Govad
I don't understand how people think call centers work. I have people call me and if they're going to have to call back, ask for my direct number "so they don't have to wait on hold." Wtf do these people think we do?
Had a guy at work that did that a lot (missing with unlocked PCs) One time while at his computer, he turned his head to talk to someone.  I very quickly took a screenshot, saved it using paint, set it as his desktop, and hid all icons.

I agree with you... in some aspects. It is true that it somewhat replaces the AP as the official rankings but they are completely stand alone systems. So I will leave you with this.... The CFP Rankings will become more interesting as we progress towards the playoff

The post 2020 regulations don't have to agree with the current ones.  Also the current bullet point proposal does not specify the details of the MGU-K, apart from it being a larger piece of the PU puzzle. The exact rules surrounding the MGU-K aren't specified and therefore don't say one way or the other how it will take shape, regardless of the current rules.

She can be used to effectively turn a 6v6 into a 6v2 instantly with her wall. I consider her a DPS simply because her wall is fail able and is nowhere near as good as any tank abilities at blocking damage. She is primarily used to spit teams and manage resources, and can be an effective genji counter if played right. She is used best for space denial. A genji cannot get into the range of her primary fire in the same way a genji can’t get within the range of a roadhog hook at higher levels and get away with it. Her abilities as a stall hero are unimportant beside this part of her kit.

I'm doing a postgrad in Marketing at UWE business school. Just finishing it up now. As a comparison, I did my undergrad at Manchester Uni, which is ranked much higher in the league tables.  I actually really love UWE. My class size was small and my lecturers actually got to know me. Lectures and tutorials were, in general, well organised and the lecturers really seemed to care. They were good teachers. The students union is small (though I'm comparing this to Manchester, which is a massive uni), but that doesn't really matter because Bristol city is amaaazing. I love it here. Friendly, always stuff going on, super interesting city. Tons of international students too, if you wanted to get to know some people from a similar background. The new business school is great too, though a bit of a maze.  Let me know if you wanna know anything else :)

I've wanted to try scanner sombre for a while.
It was even worse/an even bigger shock for me since I went completely dark on all X info after the first trailer. Xenoblade is my favorite game of all time and I wanted to go into the followup as blind as possible. Went into the game knowing nothing except for what I saw from the E3 trailers, and got badly burned when I expected it to be anything like Xenoblade whatsoever, which is completely my fault, but I only expected it to follow the basic rules that _every single other Xeno game has ever followed, such as a great story and a focus on it_.  I can understand reserving judgement, I've been following this game like a hawk since its announcement to ensure that I never get burned on a Xeno purchase like that ever again. So far though, as I said, I'm extremely happy with what I see. Hopefully it continues down this path. 
I wish the mean brother guy had a bigger payoff.   Like, Steve should have tried to out bro him which caused tension between him and Nancy. And it wasnt. That guy was just sort of in the background until he beat the shit out of Steve.

It's nothing like that.  Spam is inherently bad.  Just because most ICOs are bad doesn't mean ICOs as a whole are bad.  ERC20 was created for a reason.
If you don't mind me asking, what control do you support? I'm also incredibly liberal on pretty much every issue other than guns (gay/trans rights, freedom of religion/separation of church and state, decriminalize/legalize drugs, healthcare and education, abortion, free speech even when offensive). The problem I see is that I also think that many types of gun control are rooted in ignorance and fear, ineffective or counter-productive, or outright unconstitutional. It'd be great to be able to vote for a politician that  is liberal but also doesn't restrict guns.
I agree with you 100%. Besides that, she didn't ruin his life, he still ended up having his family on his side and I'm sure that's what matters most to him.

Good, interesting FJ clue. Largely challenging because I couldn't remember seeing "Letter Perfect" before and didn't know what to expect. Looking at J-Archive, my memory is bad - it has actually been used several times per year in the 2010s, and even as far back as 1985.

Hello there, and welcome to Subredditland! In case you're new to this [mini](https://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/77zphg/openrct2_wip_subreddit_tribute_project/) [series](https://www.reddit.com/r/rct/comments/78j7ej/openrct2_progress_on_subredditland/), I'm making a park that's inspired by the subreddit in general.  It's got 3 areas: Statsland (deals with stats, min-maxing, and just feats that involve the numbers in RCT2), Shitpostland (self-explanatory), and Seriousland (this is me building a more proper park as an exercise of my skills). I'm done with the rides in Statsland, so I began work on Shitpostland.  I hope those people that have asked for large mazes are satisfied with this :D

I think we're misunderstanding each other. I'm not treating it that way at all; I'm explaining that to her it *feels* inseparable. Even rationally knowing other people don't feel the same way and that's cool, even rationally knowing that he may value sex with intimacy with her while also wanting others.   And while you may rationally understand that your partner feels differently — not better, not worse — love and feeling loved isn't based on rationalizing. If this were a fleeting mood or shallow discomfort, sure, but this isn't an incidental part of how some people experience intimacy. It's the core.  &gt; The part that is special and intimate may just not be the "our genitals are touching" part [...] It's the emotion and intimacy that goes with it.  Exactly. But we're talking about OP, not her bf. If you're someone who does experience sex and intimacy as inseparable, then the "genitals touching" *becomes* a deeply meaningful thing, and that feeling can't be willfully suspended or reversed. Not even when trying to truly understand a partner beyond rational acceptance.  &gt; I agree, but I also think we are capable of understanding and empathy without being identical beings.  That's a jump up to hyperbole from what I'm saying, though. You don't have to be identical. But you do need enough to communicate the *feeling* of love and being loved to each other in a romantic relationship, not just the knowledge of it. All of oneself doesn't have to be mirrored; just enough, and in the core places. Where it really counts. And that means different things for everyone.  &gt; That's why I suggested she ask him why he wants the things he does, and what value he attaches to different types of sex, as well as explain her feelings.  I do agree with this completely. Many couples are okay with the difference and are still capable of feeling loved and safe with each other. But not all, and it's worth trying to get to the bottom of their differences.
Most of us understand and agree with what the episode was trying to achieve, but feel the execution was terrible.

That’s not a compromise... if they ended the rebellion he wouldn’t be able to enforce the emancipation proclamation anyway.  It was an executive order that could only be used to free slaves of states that the union was at war with.   Only congress had the power to free slaves in the union. The confederacy succeeded exactly because they expected congress to free slaves.  The emancipation proclamation was a big fuck you - were going to wreck you and free your slaves while we’re at it.

As a fellow mindbreaker mystic, I'd recommend making sure you pick spells that have "Will negates" for saving throws so it works well with your 3rd level connection power, Backlash. That way even when your fear or confusion or command spell is negated by an NPC's save you're still doing damage to them. Mind Thrust will level with you, leaving behind almost all Will negates spells so even those that get substituted benefit from Backlash. Obviously, some situational spells as well so you're not 100% stuck with the same kinds of spells but do consider the synergy between mystic spells and the connection powers.

Odds are, you drafted Julio in the top 6.  While you might not be starting him week-in/week-out, you probably should because you have deficiencies elsewhere and Jones is probably your best bet.

I’d call them. Their customer service is pretty good. Tell them what you’ve detailed here and see what they say. I called about my sights (gun was shooting low) and they said I was welcome to send it in. They said if it was the gun then they would pay but if it was just me not shooting right I’d have to pay (roughly $100). Luckily I had an extra set of sights and they fixed the issue.

Peterson was always clutching at straws. The only thing keeping him afloat is a milieu of discontent needing a scapegoat. He names it, without incurring the wrath of the capitalist status quo. Because why blame the system when you can blame the ideas of a marginal group of academics? Paglia on the other hand makes some very good points in the video appended to this article. I agree with her on the impotence of theory, and the loss of a vigorous Marxist engagement. But she also simplifies the nature of critical theory, which is well aware of this self-imposed alienation from politics, as a very consequence of late capitalism. Critical theory is cynical but realistic in so far as we live in cynical times.

Fun to play, not the best in the current meta since it loses very easily to Dshift, and generally has trouble with aggro since you have to build your deck strictly around Nephthys' pulls. It hard counters Ramp Dragon and Control Blood almost as hard as Dshift counters Nep, so those are some advantages.  Nephthys isn't really a highrolly deck unless you include Attendant of Night, Hell's Unleasher, or Twilight Queen. If you include those cards, then you can get some Liches or a double Mordecai off of playing Nephthys depending on your pulls and pull order. I wouldn't recommend playing Nep without 3x unless you are only planning to play her very rarely. Even with three Neps, it's not unusual to still not have her by turn 8.

Chief Whip Underwood was going up against much more powerful people, so he could be very cunning while still facing a challenge. As president, he holds a ton of power and is much more difficult to challenge, so they dumbed him down.

I have never used one, but I have been in the room with one in use.  Can't really say one way or the other about its efficacy, first hand.   But, with what I have read, these boards seem to pick up solely malevolent entities, not positive ones. Even if they represent themselves as harmless or playful at first. The number of positive stories are vastly outweighed by the negative ones. 
And appropriately, I had to take the picture on my bed. They weren't kidding when they said the effect on the cover was really freaking cool.

This guy is such a good presenter. He takes intensely complex ideas and makes them captivating and somehow accessible. I love this channel.
The team that started the whole 3-4-3 trend with their success last season, can't even play their own formation a year later...Rudiger played poorly today, which was one of the very few times I've seen him play like this.  I want to be positive here but it's very difficult.  If I were to take away a positive tonight it would be that we didn't have an injury (I hope).  Everyone played poorly, but Pedro showed some fight and I respect him for that at least.  Passes were very wasteful, poor quality, and just unacceptable.  We had some decent crosses but nobody and I mean NOBODY was even in the box so the crosses just wizzed on by to the other side of the field on multiple occasions.  I still love this team and despite all the emotional redditors' responses, I will try not to succumb to that level of toxicity, even though I may have been a little guilty in the moment.  Anyway let's hope we can come away with a good result on Sunday...we're going to need some luck.  I'm really interested to see if Kante can truly turn this team around once he's fit.

Remind me of one night; Dancing with my mate, who is about half a meter away from a girl. This girl who’s dancing bumps her ass on another girl’s handbag.   But thinking she got groped turned around and slapped my mate immediately. He’s a good looking dude as well, but this (drunk) woman bought none of it.   Her friend knew she fucked up and pulled her away from the dance floor. I told my mate ‘go after her and tell her immediately that you didn’t do anything. Don’t let it go’. He did and then we just continued on with the night.   The mood kinda died that night. No one felt like picking up that’s for sure.

If you want a true protection dog, that takes a very specific dog with strong nerves and a very specific temperament. It also takes a lot of high level training. It's not something you train in your backyard from YouTube videos. It's a lot of work and you need to do it right. Dogs aren't exactly great judges of character, and a badly trained protection dog is like a loaded gun you can't control.  If you just want an intimidating dog that will make strangers leave you alone, any medium/large dog will generally do that. Black dogs are supposedly more intimidating, but I'm a small woman who walks around at night in a not great suburb of DC with a 35 pound yellow dog. No one bothers me. 
Yup. I also feel like the main menu etc from what I’ve heard feels a lot more dull.  As well as the sound effects for certain actions in zombies. However I’m not hating, haven’t seen it all. 
You're not; you're excited!
Once upon a time there was a little-known/used stipulation in the catalog where if you failed a class your graduating semester, you could petition(?) to pass the course by examination. Meaning, you'd take another test after all the grades were recorded. If you pass the test, you graduate. You don't graduate in the original term you applied for, so you'd have to petition to graduate again and get out in the spring, and the F still stands, with an asterisk. It's been just over ten years since I was an undergraduate, so you should check with the Registrar to see if this option is still available.  I'd use that as a last resort though. Do what you can to work hard and earn as many remaining points as you can in the course. Talk with the instructor, etc..

Awesome, thanks!

Love the theme. This is my first month too. I am really excited about this club. I have been wanting to find a way for people to try my mixes. I don't know very many vapers in rl so I need this in my life to grow as a mixer. I have a non vaping friend that likes to try them for fun but his palate needs some serious refinement. I let him try Longing when I first mixed it and he said it tasted like captain crunch. I was actually offended on Id10-T's behalf! He meant it as a compliment but still. I love him dearly but I suspect he's the kind of guy who puts ketchup on a good steak. :-/  Oh, on the enrollment form, should it say City and State rather than County and State? I assumed so and filled it out accordingly.  Edit: PS  So is the general guideline still 3 stamps? Do you all use bubble envelopes?

I'll stop short of absolute horror/NSFL (but still pretty gross) so as not to be a downer.  Important background information, when I was young I lived on a fairly straight, but steep hill. I'd say around a 20-30 degree incline, and maybe 200 yards long. I also lived near a man-made neighborhood lake, which had a 5 or 6' drainage pipe at one end to handle overflow.  One year, they did a replacement on the top 3 or 4' length of said pipe and just sort of tossed the original aside near the lake. I'm guesstimating on size since I was a kid, it was just about right for my 10-year-old self to climb inside comfortably though. So my buddy and I looked at the hill, looked at the pipe, and came up with the brilliantly fun plan to take the pipe up the hill and take turns riding down in it. I was chosen to go first because my friend ~~was an asshole and wanted to see if I'd die~~ thought it was a good idea and I was a passive sort.  So we roll the pipe up to the top of the hill, I get in and start my roll down. It was horrifying, frankly, and I was shocked I didn't break any bones being tossed around in there. Here's where it gets fun: the hill ended in a cul-de-sac with a storm drain. We didn't have any real plan for stopping, which only occurred to me as I hit the flatter ground of the cul-de-sac and realized what was about to happen.  So yeah, I hit that storm drain, and due to the momentum the pipe went flying over the drain, tossing me out where I landed in the drainage ditch the drain flowed into, which was full of sticks, leaves, and as I slowly regained coherence from the fall I realized one more thing.  It contained the decaying body of a full-grown Elk, and I was in the middle of it with its half-rotted skull about a foot from my face. The smell I'd originally taken as your normal drainage reek was actually about a thousand pounds of decaying flesh. I was inside the body of a massive, dead animal.  Later inquiries determined that the guy who lived at the foot of the hill had gone hunting a few weeks before, and wanted the skeleton but didn't want to bother with cleaning it. So he just tossed it in that ditch and waited for time and nature to take its course.  [thanks buddy](#ptsd)

Naw, i find this fundamentally flawed. THIS is how echo chambers are formed. If this guy never voiced his opinion i'd never be aware there exist a group that thinks Phil is far left.   You HAVE to consume media you disagree with to have an informed opinion. It only matters how much you take as valid. Sure there are sources you can ignore and probably be fine, but being tangentially aware of it at least should be the bare minimum you strive for. Would i go to breitbart for news? No probably not. But if i was preparing material to talk to a alt-right guy, i might go to breitbart to prepare counter-points to common alt right talking points.

The mango one tasted pretty good.
If enough people give a shit I’ll share the recipe.   Edit: Oh shit wow ok ok reddit has spoken! I used homemade pizza sauce from the garden and mozzarella cheese. Toppings were bacon and mushrooms. The crust, was really the point of this pizza (obviously). When I kneaded the dough, I kept the outer edge tacky by using less flour when stretching it out. I pushed the dough beyond the size of the pizza I wanted. I used a pack of expensive expensive hickory-smoked bacon, cooked it, and cut it up into bits. Then I lined string cheese and bacon bits around the edge, rolled the dough inward, over the goods And pressed down almost like how you seal a pierogi/tuck in a bed sheet. THEN I brushed a garlic-parmesan egg wash all around the crust. This part is important. It really makes the crust taste amazing. 
I like to overthink stuff

Every time your mom brings up religion, tell her, “I don’t want to discuss this any more,” and change the subject.  If she persists, abruptly end the conversation: hang up the phone or walk away.  After a few times, skip straight to ending the conversation by hanging up the phone or walking away.  She’ll quickly learn that if she wants you in her life, she is not allowed to discuss religion with you.

From my experience, once you get back this far, the most trustworthy sources are  wills, legal proceedings, and newspaper clippings. If you are lucky, the family is described in a book of ancestry for a certain last name. These books were commonly made and researched by individuals ~1900, so information should be relevant. Though they can be made at any time obviously. Also, if you find an untrustworthy source, such as someone's ancestry or wikitree page for your family, sometimes they might have listed their sources.  I usually try searching the person's name and birth or death date and see what comes up. If they included a satisfactory source, then I go ahead and browse the source. It's like using wikipedia for a research paper, you get an idea and then verify the actual facts from the direct source.  Since you don't have any paid resources, a good way is definitely to search for the person's wikitree page, and see what sources are listed there. Pretty much all of the old genealogy books for families are available online via a google search. Sometimes they are on archive.com, sometimes other sites. Also your local library might have some, doesn't hurt to check. Also, you can use ancestrylibrary version at the library for free, which might be useful to you. This is also available at most universities.

The loot has been taken, but the tracks of whoever previously looted the place are still fresh. If they can catch and defeat the looters (preferably monstrous humanoids like orcs or whatever for alignment sake)   they can take what those guys got. Which in the end can still just be a level appropriate reward plus a scroll with a map or clue to the whereabouts of more magical items (maybe)   Edit : also you can make some of the magical treasure funny since surely the best stuff is long gone. A crate containing 50 potions of endure elements would be hilariously worthless.

Guys, if this was not made by the man himself, Hidetaka Miyazaki, forget about this comic. The man is fucked, no one understands the full story exept for him.

Uh... Probably an animal rights activist?   Look, I respect vegans, vegetarians, or people who care about animals, I really do, but some of them, perhaps a vocal minority, are just looking to be provocative and in your face. PETA are just like that sometimes.  I'm not gonna justify eating meat or discuss the whole philosophy of the matter, that's not the point. What I do want to talk about is bad PR and dumb logic, here's a quote from a [PCgamer article:](http://www.pcgamer.com/how-peta-invaded-the-games-industry/)  &gt;March 2009 Irked by the killing of attack dogs in Call of Duty: World at War, PETA sends copies of Nintendogs to Activision’s HQ, along with invites to an “empathy for animals seminar”. November 2011 Battlefield 3 is slammed by PETA’s German wing for letting players stab a rat. Apparently, this could have “a brutalising effect on the young male target audience”. March 2013 PETA gives out leaflets at the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm event, reminding guests that “Zerglings have feelings, too”. Terran players aren’t amused. February 2015 Evolve’s cast of carnivorous beasties attracts PETA’s wrath. According to one protester, “Vegan monsters are grossly underrepresented in the gaming industry.”  I get it, PETA, you don't want people becoming desensitized to violence, specifically animal cruelty. Thing is, studies have yet to find a link between violence and video games, and there are a lot of funded contradicting researches that prove nothing.   So instead, PETA makes absurd claims about animals and straight up fictional creatures without understanding context and tries to vilify video game companies to promote their own agenda.  In short, just as much as shooting a person in a video game won't make me a killer, raising a Pokemon doesn't make me a dog fighting ring organizer.
Agreed!  And I wouldn't add the last one.
Even the much-vaunted season 1 had a weak finale IMO. I don't know why people only cite the later seasons as having mixed quality.

Office 
This system is.. I dunno, I wouldn't buy it.  The GTX 1050 is the very entry level for gaming GPUs, it'll be "adequate" for 1080p gaming, but that's about it.  You should try to find something with a GTX 1060 GPU, even if it has a lower processor (a Core i3 + GTX 1060 is better than a Core i5 + GTX 1050).  Unfortunately, it's rare for a pre-built brand-name system to be configured that way, because most of their customers are clueless about what is really needed for a gaming system, so they'll always be Core i5/i7-based.  /u/tigojones 's suggestion that you go to an actual computer shop is probably a better plan, as it'll let you get a lower-end CPU and a higher-end GPU, plus they'll be able to put in an SSD (I really recommend one) without blowing up the price too much.  Plus the 12GB of RAM is wonky.. there's almost no benefit to it, since most games won't take advantage of it, and those that do are going to be upset that 4GB of it is single-channel, either go with 8GB or 16GB.  As well, I understand why you might be reluctant to build your own PC, though most people around here will encourage you to in order to get the best pricing.  Building your own system requires knowing what to do, how to do it, time to do it, and then the ability to troubleshoot problems, plus there's the hassle of processing RMAs for individual components if anything goes wrong.

I disagree pretty heavily, you should E mid W because it's when you are self slowed, thus you will get more out of the E's dash itself while W'd even if you pause two hits of W in return for getting more passive procs. Not to mention, with the faster Q (which is amazing by the way), hitting a max range Q isn't enough to get you into range of the E because of the pause before you dash, while still having the enemy be slowed (when you start pausing to dash usually the slow wears off). It's far stronger when you're in mid melee range, which is when you're doing W anyways. Of course when you buy Frozen Mallet this all becomes moot because you can just auto attack into E first, but I find using E during W is much stronger especially when 2~ ticks of W only hit for like one leg proc.

With all the difficulties you’re describing in logistics, have you asked your doctor about doing both a colonoscopy and endoscopy at the same time? The prep sucks but then it will all be over in one day. Doing both at the same appointment would mean only having to find one ride on one day, and only dealing with one round of IVs/anesthesia.  It my experience it takes a long time to get these things scheduled (like, they book 2-3 months out) but maybe your doctor has better availability. My suggestion would be to, if possible, do it when you can have a friend/loved one be with you because that might reduce your anxiety. Yes, it’s inconvenient for everyone, but it’s a medical procedure to try to figure out ways to help you. There’s only so much GI specialists can identify through blood work and non-invasive testing and there are a lot of things they can only conclusively identify with endoscopes and colonoscopies (like h. Pylori infections and inflammatory bowel disease).  The other option, if you can afford it, is to see if you can get a home health aid who can drive you there and back and make sure you are okay at home afterward. Care.com has people with background checks and might have what you need. I would expect you’d have to shell out a decent amount per hour though, so if money is tight that might not be a good option. But it would avoid involving a coworker and get you home safely.
Yes, I'm on OPT and I will be starting my program from Spring 2018.  No. We're not illegal. Again, F-1/OPT is closely tied to the i20 of the university you currently study in. Moreover, it is unrelated to OMSCS which is purely an online medium of education. 
60 ft blindsight?  Get rid of that, no debate.   Other than that explain the bite attack more. What situations can you use it? While hidden? You never *know* when you are hidden, that's why rogues require advantage for sneak attack. Is the bite an attack like grapple and shove or is it an action that makes a single attack?

There are a lot of fake ones out there... ran into one a while back who claimed they "loved" Star Wars and all of that (I didn't want to date her, just thought I'd found another friend.) Turns out she didn't know much about it and hadn't even seen ROTS. This same girl said she was a gamer and she had a PS3 so I was thinking okay fair enough. She comes over and literally couldn't do anything involving two sticks. It was pretty depressing and it got to the point where she kept loading in all these different games and I just didn't want to play any more. Hyped up her ability in racing games only for me to win whilst scrolling through Instagram.   I wasn't even being douchey about it and we're still friends over other stuff but it was very disappointing.
Wow
Welp, the kids seem to be all done. We got about 25 or so altogether. That's a lot better than zero! Almost all were wearing costumes!

The game was never finished completely for the PC, for many reasons.  So there is nothing to compare because the game was never released for PC.  That's like saying Mario Odyssey is badly optimized and sucks on the PC, you just can't compare anything.  Yes, they said they tried to do it but nothing came of it.
Yeah there's not many guns with that high a cyclic rate; I was almost maybe thinking a [MAC-11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjyWcMoxIVE) or, like I said, something going into slam-fire full auto. Maybe it is just a very odd echo but there are several distinct loud impulses in the sound that first "shot" makes.  Shoddy open bolt replica blank-guns are known to slam fire quite easily. I wonder if this might be a replica that's been modified to fire live ammo.

He was mistaken on both points.  The autopsy said:  &gt; At Bethesda, the autopsy report of the president, Warren Exhibit CE 387 described the back wound as being oval, 6 by 4 millimetres (0.24 in × 0.16 in), and located "above the upper border of the scapula" (shoulder blade) at a location 14 centimetres (5.5 in) from the tip of the right acromion process, and 14 centimetres (5.5 in) below the right mastoid process (the bony prominence behind the ear).  &gt; The concluding page of the Bethesda autopsy report states: "The other missile [the bullet to the back] entered the right superior posterior thorax above the scapula, and traversed the soft tissues of the supra-scapular and the supra-clavicular portions of the base of the right side of the neck."  Additionally, a panel of four physicians were asked to review the evidence by the US Attorney General in Feb 1968, and their conclusions were:  &gt; The decedent was wounded by two bullets, both of which entered his body from behind. One bullet struck the back of the decedent's head well above the external occipital protuberance. Based upon the observation that he was leaning forward with his head turned obliquely to the left when this bullet struck, the photographs and X-rays indicate that it came from a site above and slightly to his right.  Edit: What you describe is probably related to this:  &gt; The Sibert/O'Neill FBI autopsy report original made by two FBI agents (Special Agents James W. Sibert and Francis X. O'Neill) present at the autopsy preserves genuine confusion amongst medical doctors present during the autopsy, caused by apparent lack of an exit wound, which was cleared up later in the official report after new and more complete information became available (the exit had been hidden by a tracheotomy incision)

I've got a simple web app that uses a third party api to display info. I want to expand the service to manage authentication, paid subscription, and somewhat complex algorithms that deliver value to paying customers.   I'm using ASP.NET and I recently switched to Azure from a super cheap hosting service. Don't really need much of a database as the API provides most of the data, though I will need one for users. I was thinking of using Firebase as I'm familiar with it and I'd probably be within the free tier for a while. Though I haven't looked much at alternatives.   Another thing I'd like to do is cache large JSONs I receive from the API so users don't have to wait the long time it takes to receive them.  I've coded and set everything up myself so far so I'm pretty proficient technically but I'm definitely not confident in the cloud front. Would love to here your thoughts. Thanks!  Edit: also after switching to Azure I randomly sometimes get a 502 when browsing my site. I just started looking into it and obviously you're not a tech support person but maybe you know of some beginner mistake I'm making.

15-30 pounds is considered "some weight."  Essentially, but not always. Many people rely on their family doctor, rather than consulting a specialist like the endocrinologist I work for. Family physicians quite often are in the practice of simply prescribing T4 and blaming the patient if it isn't working ("You must not be taking your medication properly.") There often are other factors and tests (such as the reverse T3) that only a specialist will consider. Granted, these patients are rare but they do exist and are definitely not imaginary.   I have Lupus and maintain my same routine (both with food and exercise) while in a flare, other than the addition of the high dose of prednisone. Causes my face to appear fat and become extremely round, looking more like a moon pie than the moon (a really cute one though), even though my scale shows no change.   EDIT: Grammar and spelling.

I completely purged my story and made all the main characters historical figures.  I wanted to do several separate stories in a connected multiverse and have an awesome finale arc where all the main characters and their worlds merge into one crazy multi-genre epic.  But it was such a monumental task to create entire dimensions each with multiple cultures and dialects, it got stretched too thin.  I loved my characters though so I immortalised them and instead put their epic final arc into fables and history. I killed off one dimension and replaced it with our own reality, where the story takes place (kinda) and we have been secretly observed for 60 years so the other species can reference pop culture and speak modern English. The main characters all interact within the 'inbetween' dimension and therefore I don't need to overwhelm the reader with multi-world exposition.  Its a bit like how ASOIAF is huge, but most of the story is Westeros-centric (and not surprisingly, its original fanbase are western nerds who already get the jist of medieval european politics), while Yi-Ti remains a fun little mystery within the world. That's basically what I did.

Firstly: dont do bareback! It is super dangerous!! Please don't risk your health for nasty clients. Secondly, look at your local advertisements of sex workers and what they are charging. That should give you a rough ballpark. Also maybe consider signing with an agency that does check ups on clients and requires you to check in with them and share your location. This is especially important bc transwomen are at even higher risk of being assaulted in general but also as sex workers.  Another thing you should try to do is thinking about your personal boundaries and how to confidently enforce them with clients.  Good Luck and again: PLEASE be safe!

Where did I say "dark" referred to the skin color?  This "scarcity of information" is undoubtedly true, and this is the very problem for the following reasons:  1.  This phrase was used (and helped propagate) the mystery and alleged savagery of, as they would say, "the Negro race."  2. The phrase came to be from Enlightenment-era European colonialists literally erasing geographical information about Africa off of popular maps so that Europeans could be credited with "discoveries," despite many parts of the Middle East and Asia having known this information for millennia with it being readily available for Europeans to learn of.   3. The phrase helped European settlers downplay the assistance of local African villagers, guides, and even slaves, in pursuit of fame back home--further perpetuating white, eurocentric conceptions of discovering the "rest of the world".  4. The phrase was popularized by European explorer Henry Morton Stanley, whose exploration and literature inspired other works and another similar popular phrase for the same interior, the "Heart of Darkness." A novella of this same name by Joseph Conrad was used to explain and justify the atrocious violence committed by Europeans, arguing that the cruel savagery of the native Africans brought out their own inner savagery.   In conclusion, while yes one can make the technical argument that "dark" in "the dark continent" is not literally about their skin color, it seems unclear how one can separate the racist historicity of this term's origins, usage, and effects on Africans. I hope you will consider changing your mind on the term. **References and further reading:**  Dane Keith Kennedy, *The Last Blank Spaces: Exploring Africa and Australia.* (2013)  Joseph Conrad, *Heart of Darkness* (1899)  Johannes Fabian , *Out of Our Minds: Reason and Madness in the Exploration of Central Africa* (2000)   John Leighton, *Western Africa: Its History, Condition, and Prospects*  (1856) edit: Oh, you're a the_donald member.

How much you moving, how much you got?
But every other game (from 6 on) was really different and confusing "compared to the other games".   * 6 introduced the idea that EVERY character can learn magic. And even fighters could eventually cast spells...the idea of character classes wouldn't really be abandoned til the next game though. * 7 had that crazy materia system and the idea that there were no "designated character classes" for each character (which would be a concept that would be revisted in many of the future FF titles) * 8 has a system where the monsters level with you and that weird junction system where you link your spells to your stats. And what's this...you can't buy new weapons and there is no armor?   * 9 was a throwback to 6 and the old school FF games...and a return to character classes and 4 commands.   * 10 had that crazy sphere board thing.   * 11 was an MMO?   * 12 had the completely novel gambit license system (which admittedly, I still don't quite understand).  The last game I really played through was 9. I played a little bit of the others but I honestly haven't touched 13-14 at all, so I don't feel comfortable typing anything about them. But each one was rather revolutionary.  7 and 8 went on sale a few years ago on Steam, and I bought them and replayed them (first time playing it through since I moved out of my parents' house). I think the love for 7 is driven mostly by nostalgia. 8 is legit a great game though...even nearly two decades later. The story is so compelling and relatable (though it does get kinda asspully with the time travel at the end of there...) because it's about growing up, making friends, and finding love (even if there is a great sorceress war to try to distract you from all that).

We play hardcore custom campaigns or Paizo modules with limitations (our current brainless campaign is Wrath of the Righteous without mythic abilities and doubled monster HP values to make it fair.)  Low point buy just leads to retarded situations like someone getting literally one shot because no effort went into actually balancing low level combat.

Right because you’ll always have five other friends with schedules the same as yours every week. /s
OMG Are u Paul? 
Which episode?
one of those pale fuckers from the mayflower
Agreed, I took the room of a guy who worked on s2 and he was moving to the other end of the US for a few months work he'd found. Tough. 
The fuck is wrong with you? 
Though you're from a different area, so I guess that must be factored in
&gt; So we'll have Tesla, LG and Samsung cars, not Tesla, BMW and VW.  Hilarious.
Do any of you have a record y'all listen to on Halloween? I recently heard the soundtrack and man I knew it was a must have for me. The fact that it can easily be played on Halloween makes it even better. I'm open to any other scary/creepy/unsettling records to listen to. Something but eerie music makes me so happy to listen to it. Happy Halloween!
So I’m able to watch the first half! Awesome! Heading to Magic Castle in Hollywood after.  I’m I want the Crew to win this because they’ve been fucked with but I’m also a big fan of Villa.   I’m just hoping for a great game!
I makes me happy that other people joke with their mothers about wire hangers.
Looks like alien shit but ok. 
This is what rally is. Driving/flying and just barely not crashing. Anyways, a pretty tame jump.
SEO/digital marketer here. The reason you see this with recipes? It increases rankings on search results (aka SERPs)  It is debated, but it seems like it is good for Google's algorithms to  have longer content. The problem with recipes is that in itself, it's only a paragraph. By upping the word count, it makes it easier to insert more keywords (without keyword stuffing, since they are in context) and makes it "look" like its higher quality. Combine that with structured snippet coding for the recipe, and Google is more likely to throw it to the top of the SERPs.  Unfortunately, Google has been slow to discourage this type of recipe layout. Hopefully that will change in the future, especially with AMP pages becoming a thing.  As for the pop ups, while Google "says" they don't like it, it doesn't seem like they penalize it. As annoying as they are, there is evidence from experts that they increase conversions. (aka signing up for an email list) I hate this as much as everyone else and refuse to every put them on the websites I work with. (at most, maybe at the very bottom of an article, but usually I do a "fly-in" in the corner so not to intrude on the user experience.)
State of the art Bang Bang. 
CIG is obviously tight on funds.
Well, right now "New *York* Giants" doesn't have the same ring it used to have, either.
I'm probably the first to jump on "read the sidebar," but this case is kind of troubling. I definitely agree with "document everything" and suggest that the OP should probably withdraw from email contact with this prof as much as possible.
